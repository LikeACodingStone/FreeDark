CHAPTER I
第一章

SISTERS
姐妹

Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen sat one morning in the window-bay of their father’s house in Beldover, working and talking. Ursula was stitching a piece of brightly-coloured embroidery, and Gudrun was drawing upon a board which she held on her knee. They were mostly silent, talking as their thoughts strayed through their minds.
一天早上，乌苏拉和古德伦·布兰文坐在他们父亲位于贝尔多弗的房子的窗台上，边工作边聊天。乌苏拉正在缝制一幅色彩鲜艳的刺绣，古德伦则在她放在膝盖上的一块木板上画画。他们大多都沉默不语，各自思绪飘荡。

‘Ursula,’ said Gudrun, ‘don’t you REALLY WANT to get married?’ Ursula laid her embroidery in her lap and looked up. Her face was calm and considerate.
“乌苏拉，”古德伦说，“你真的不想结婚吗？”乌苏拉把刺绣放在腿上，抬起头来。她的表情平静而体贴。

‘I don’t know,’ she replied. ‘It depends how you mean.’
“我不知道，”她回答道。 “这取决于你的意思。”

Gudrun was slightly taken aback. She watched her sister for some moments.
古珍微微一愣。她注视着姐姐一会儿。

‘Well,’ she said, ironically, ‘it usually means one thing! But don’t you think anyhow, you’d be—‘ she darkened slightly—‘in a better position than you are in now.’
“好吧，”她讽刺地说，“这通常意味着一件事！但你难道不认为，无论如何，你会——”她的脸色稍微阴沉下来——“比你现在的处境更好。”

A shadow came over Ursula’s face.
乌苏拉的脸上笼罩着阴影。

‘I might,’ she said. ‘But I’m not sure.’
“我可能会，”她说。 “但我不确定。”

Again Gudrun paused, slightly irritated. She wanted to be quite definite.
古德伦再次停了下来，有点恼怒。她想要非常明确。

‘You don’t think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?’ she asked.
“你认为一个人不需要结婚的经历吗？”她问道。

‘Do you think it need BE an experience?’ replied Ursula.
“你认为这需要成为一种体验吗？”乌苏拉回答道。

‘Bound to be, in some way or other,’ said Gudrun, coolly. ‘Possibly undesirable, but bound to be an experience of some sort.’
“一定会的，以某种方式，”古德伦冷静地说。 “可能不受欢迎，但一定会成为某种经历。”

‘Not really,’ said Ursula. ‘More likely to be the end of experience.’
“不完全是，”乌苏拉说。 “更有可能是体验的终结。”

Gudrun sat very still, to attend to this.
古德伦一动不动地坐着，专心处理这件事。

‘Of course,’ she said, ‘there’s THAT to consider.’ This brought the conversation to a close. Gudrun, almost angrily, took up her rubber and began to rub out part of her drawing. Ursula stitched absorbedly.
“当然，”她说，“还有一些事情需要考虑。”谈话就此结束。古德伦几乎是生气了，拿起橡皮开始擦去她画的一部分。乌苏拉全神贯注地缝着针。

‘You wouldn’t consider a good offer?’ asked Gudrun.
“你不考虑一个好的提议吗？”古德伦问。

‘I think I’ve rejected several,’ said Ursula.
“我想我已经拒绝了好几个，”乌苏拉说。

‘REALLY!’ Gudrun flushed dark—‘But anything really worth while? Have you REALLY?’
“真的！”古德伦的脸涨得通红——“但是有什么真正值得做的事吗？你真的吗？

‘A thousand a year, and an awfully nice man. I liked him awfully,’ said Ursula.
“一年一千块，而且是个非常好的人。”我非常喜欢他，”乌苏拉说。

‘Really! But weren’t you fearfully tempted?’
'真的吗！但你没有受到可怕的诱惑吗？

‘In the abstract but not in the concrete,’ said Ursula. ‘When it comes to the point, one isn’t even tempted—oh, if I were tempted, I’d marry like a shot. I’m only tempted NOT to.’ The faces of both sisters suddenly lit up with amusement.
“是抽象的，而不是具体的，”乌苏拉说。 “说到这一点，一个人甚至不会受到诱惑——哦，如果我受到诱惑，我会毫不犹豫地结婚。我只是不想这么做。”姐妹俩的脸上突然露出了有趣的表情。

‘Isn’t it an amazing thing,’ cried Gudrun, ‘how strong the temptation is, not to!’ They both laughed, looking at each other. In their hearts they were frightened.
“这不是一件令人惊奇的事情吗？”古德伦喊道，“不去的诱惑是多么强烈！”他们互相看着对方，大笑起来。他们的心中，都充满了恐惧。

There was a long pause, whilst Ursula stitched and Gudrun went on with her sketch. The sisters were women, Ursula twenty-six, and Gudrun twenty-five. But both had the remote, virgin look of modern girls, sisters of Artemis rather than of Hebe. Gudrun was very beautiful, passive, soft-skinned, soft-limbed. She wore a dress of dark-blue silky stuff, with ruches of blue and green linen lace in the neck and sleeves; and she had emerald-green stockings. Her look of confidence and diffidence contrasted with Ursula’s sensitive expectancy. The provincial people, intimidated by Gudrun’s perfect sang-froid and exclusive bareness of manner, said of her: ‘She is a smart woman.’ She had just come back from London, where she had spent several years, working at an art-school, as a student, and living a studio life.
停顿了很长一段时间，乌苏拉开始缝线，古德伦继续画草图。姐妹俩都是女性，乌苏拉二十六岁，古德伦二十五岁。但她们都具有现代女孩的冷漠、处女的外表，她们是阿耳忒弥斯的姐妹，而不是赫柏的姐妹。古德伦非常美丽，被动，皮肤柔软，四肢柔软。她穿着一件深蓝色丝质连衣裙，领子和袖子上有蓝色和绿色的亚麻蕾丝褶皱。她还穿着翠绿色的长袜。她的自信和羞怯的表情与乌苏拉敏感的期待形成鲜明对比。外省人民被古德伦完美的冷静和独特的朴素态度所吓倒，他们这样评价她：“她是一个聪明的女人。”她刚刚从伦敦回来，她在那里的一所艺术学校工作了几年。 ，作为一名学生，过着工作室生活。

‘I was hoping now for a man to come along,’ Gudrun said, suddenly catching her underlip between her teeth, and making a strange grimace, half sly smiling, half anguish. Ursula was afraid.
“我现在希望有一个男人能来，”古德伦说，突然用牙齿咬住下唇，做了个奇怪的鬼脸，一半是狡猾的微笑，一半是痛苦。乌苏拉很害怕。

‘So you have come home, expecting him here?’ she laughed.
“这么说你已经回家了，等着他来？”她笑道。

‘Oh my dear,’ cried Gudrun, strident, ‘I wouldn’t go out of my way to look for him. But if there did happen to come along a highly attractive individual of sufficient means—well—‘ she tailed off ironically. Then she looked searchingly at Ursula, as if to probe her. ‘Don’t you find yourself getting bored?’ she asked of her sister. ‘Don’t you find, that things fail to materialise? NOTHING MATERIALISES! Everything withers in the bud.’
“哦，天哪，”古德伦大声喊道，“我不会特意去找他。”但如果碰巧出现了一个非常有魅力、有足够财力的人——好吧——”她讽刺地停了下来。然后她探寻地看着乌苏拉，仿佛在试探她。 “你不觉得自己很无聊吗？”她问姐姐。 ‘你难道没有发现，事情无法实现吗？什么都没有实现！一切都在萌芽状态下枯萎。

‘What withers in the bud?’ asked Ursula.
“什么东西在萌芽状态下就枯萎了？”乌苏拉问。

‘Oh, everything—oneself—things in general.’ There was a pause, whilst each sister vaguely considered her fate.
“哦，一切——自己——一般的事情。”停顿了一下，每个姐妹都模模糊糊地思考着自己的命运。

‘It does frighten one,’ said Ursula, and again there was a pause. ‘But do you hope to get anywhere by just marrying?’
“这确实让人害怕，”乌苏拉说道，然后又停顿了一下。 “但是你希望通过结婚就能有所成就吗？”

‘It seems to be the inevitable next step,’ said Gudrun. Ursula pondered this, with a little bitterness. She was a class mistress herself, in Willey Green Grammar School, as she had been for some years.
“这似乎是不可避免的下一步，”古德伦说。乌苏拉带着一点苦涩思考着这个问题。她本人是威利·格林文法学校的班主任，多年来一直担任班主任。

‘I know,’ she said, ‘it seems like that when one thinks in the abstract. But really imagine it: imagine any man one knows, imagine him coming home to one every evening, and saying ‘Hello,’ and giving one a kiss—‘
“我知道，”她说，“抽象思考时似乎就是这样。”但真正想象一下：想象一下任何一个认识的人，想象他每天晚上回家对一个人说‘你好’，然后给一个人一个吻——”

There was a blank pause.
一阵空白的停顿。

‘Yes,’ said Gudrun, in a narrowed voice. ‘It’s just impossible. The man makes it impossible.’
“是的，”古德伦用狭窄的声音说道。 ‘这根本不可能。这个男人让这一切变得不可能。

‘Of course there’s children—‘ said Ursula doubtfully.
“当然有孩子——”乌苏拉疑惑地说。

Gudrun’s face hardened.
古德伦的脸色变得严肃起来。

‘Do you REALLY want children, Ursula?’ she asked coldly. A dazzled, baffled look came on Ursula’s face.
“你真的想要孩子吗，乌苏拉？”她冷冷地问。乌苏拉的脸上浮现出一种眼花缭乱、困惑的表情。

‘One feels it is still beyond one,’ she said.
“人们感觉它仍然超出一，”她说。

‘DO you feel like that?’ asked Gudrun. ‘I get no feeling whatever from the thought of bearing children.’
“你有这样的感觉吗？”古德伦问。 “一想到要生孩子，我就没有任何感觉。”

Gudrun looked at Ursula with a masklike, expressionless face. Ursula knitted her brows.
古德伦用一张面具般、面无表情的脸看着乌苏拉。乌苏拉皱起了眉头。

‘Perhaps it isn’t genuine,’ she faltered. ‘Perhaps one doesn’t really want them, in one’s soul—only superficially.’ A hardness came over Gudrun’s face. She did not want to be too definite.
“也许这不是真的，”她结结巴巴地说。 “也许一个人的灵魂里并不真正想要它们——只是表面上的。”古德伦的脸上露出了一丝冷酷。她不想说得太明确。

‘When one thinks of other people’s children—‘ said Ursula.
“当一个人想到别人的孩子时——”乌苏拉说。

Again Gudrun looked at her sister, almost hostile.
古珍再次看着她的妹妹，几乎充满敌意。

‘Exactly,’ she said, to close the conversation.
“没错，”她说，结束了谈话。

The two sisters worked on in silence, Ursula having always that strange brightness of an essential flame that is caught, meshed, contravened. She lived a good deal by herself, to herself, working, passing on from day to day, and always thinking, trying to lay hold on life, to grasp it in her own understanding. Her active living was suspended, but underneath, in the darkness, something was coming to pass. If only she could break through the last integuments! She seemed to try and put her hands out, like an infant in the womb, and she could not, not yet. Still she had a strange prescience, an intimation of something yet to come.
两姐妹默默地工作着，乌苏拉总是有着一种奇怪的明亮的基本火焰，这种火焰被捕捉、交织、对抗。她独自生活了很多时间，工作，日复一日地过着，总是在思考，试图抓住生活，用自己的理解来把握它。她积极的生活被暂停了，但在地下，在黑暗中，有一些事情正在发生。要是她能突破最后的外壳就好了！她似乎想把手伸出来，就像子宫里的婴儿一样，但她做不到，目前还做不到。但她仍然有一种奇怪的预感，预感到有什么事情即将发生。

She laid down her work and looked at her sister. She thought Gudrun so CHARMING, so infinitely charming, in her softness and her fine, exquisite richness of texture and delicacy of line. There was a certain playfulness about her too, such a piquancy or ironic suggestion, such an untouched reserve. Ursula admired her with all her soul.
她放下手中的工作，看着姐姐。她认为古德伦是如此迷人，如此无限迷人，她的柔软和细腻、精致、丰富的纹理和精致的线条。她也有一种顽皮的感觉，一种辛辣或讽刺的暗示，一种未受触动的矜持。乌苏拉全心全意地钦佩她。

‘Why did you come home, Prune?’ she asked.
“你为什么回家，普鲁？”她问。

Gudrun knew she was being admired. She sat back from her drawing and looked at Ursula, from under her finely-curved lashes.
古德伦知道她受到了钦佩。她从画中坐下来，从纤细弯曲的睫毛下看着乌苏拉。

‘Why did I come back, Ursula?’ she repeated. ‘I have asked myself a thousand times.’
“我为什么回来，乌苏拉？”她重复道。 “我已经问自己一千遍了。”

‘And don’t you know?’
“你不知道吗？”

‘Yes, I think I do. I think my coming back home was just RECULER POUR MIEUX SAUTER.’
“是的，我想我知道。”我想我回家只是为了“RECULER POUR MIEUX SAUTER”。

And she looked with a long, slow look of knowledge at Ursula.
她用一种长长的、缓慢的、充满知识的眼神看着乌苏拉。

‘I know!’ cried Ursula, looking slightly dazzled and falsified, and as if she did NOT know. ‘But where can one jump to?’
“我知道！”乌苏拉喊道，她看起来有点眼花缭乱，有些虚伪，好像她不知道一样。 “但是可以跳到哪里呢？”

‘Oh, it doesn’t matter,’ said Gudrun, somewhat superbly. ‘If one jumps over the edge, one is bound to land somewhere.’
“哦，没关系，”古德伦说，语气有些出色。 “如果一个人跳过边缘，就一定会在某个地方着陆。”

‘But isn’t it very risky?’ asked Ursula.
“但这不是很危险吗？”乌苏拉问。

A slow mocking smile dawned on Gudrun’s face.
古德伦的脸上慢慢浮现出一丝嘲讽的微笑。

‘Ah!’ she said laughing. ‘What is it all but words!’ And so again she closed the conversation. But Ursula was still brooding.
“啊！”她笑着说道。 “这不过是言语而已！”于是她再次结束了谈话。但乌苏拉仍在沉思。

‘And how do you find home, now you have come back to it?’ she asked.
“既然你已经回到家了，那你怎么找到家呢？”她问道。

Gudrun paused for some moments, coldly, before answering. Then, in a cold truthful voice, she said:
古德伦冷冷地停顿了一会儿，然后才回答。然后，她用冰冷而真实的声音说道：

‘I find myself completely out of it.’
“我发现自己完全脱离了困境。”

‘And father?’
“那父亲呢？”

Gudrun looked at Ursula, almost with resentment, as if brought to bay.
古德伦看着乌苏拉，几乎带着怨恨，仿佛陷入了困境。

‘I haven’t thought about him: I’ve refrained,’ she said coldly.
“我没有想过他：我已经克制住了，”她冷冷地说。

‘Yes,’ wavered Ursula; and the conversation was really at an end. The sisters found themselves confronted by a void, a terrifying chasm, as if they had looked over the edge.
“是的，”乌苏拉犹豫不决。谈话就真的结束了。姐妹俩发现自己面临着一个虚空，一个可怕的鸿沟，就好像她们已经看到了边缘一样。

They worked on in silence for some time, Gudrun’s cheek was flushed with repressed emotion. She resented its having been called into being.
他们默默地工作了一段时间，古德伦的脸颊因为压抑的情绪而涨得通红。她对它的诞生感到不满。

‘Shall we go out and look at that wedding?’ she asked at length, in a voice that was too casual.
“我们要出去看看那场婚礼吗？”她最后问道，语气太随意了。

‘Yes!’ cried Ursula, too eagerly, throwing aside her sewing and leaping up, as if to escape something, thus betraying the tension of the situation and causing a friction of dislike to go over Gudrun’s nerves.
“是的！”乌苏拉喊道，她太急切了，抛开缝纫活，跳了起来，仿佛要逃避什么，这样就暴露了局势的紧张，让古德伦的神经产生了一种厌恶的摩擦。

As she went upstairs, Ursula was aware of the house, of her home round about her. And she loathed it, the sordid, too-familiar place! She was afraid at the depth of her feeling against the home, the milieu, the whole atmosphere and condition of this obsolete life. Her feeling frightened her.
当乌苏拉上楼时，她意识到了这座房子，意识到了她周围的家。她厌恶这个肮脏、太熟悉的地方！她对这个过时的生活的家庭、环境、整个氛围和状况感到深深的恐惧。她的感觉让她感到害怕。

The two girls were soon walking swiftly down the main road of Beldover, a wide street, part shops, part dwelling-houses, utterly formless and sordid, without poverty. Gudrun, new from her life in Chelsea and Sussex, shrank cruelly from this amorphous ugliness of a small colliery town in the Midlands. Yet forward she went, through the whole sordid gamut of pettiness, the long amorphous, gritty street. She was exposed to every stare, she passed on through a stretch of torment. It was strange that she should have chosen to come back and test the full effect of this shapeless, barren ugliness upon herself. Why had she wanted to submit herself to it, did she still want to submit herself to it, the insufferable torture of these ugly, meaningless people, this defaced countryside? She felt like a beetle toiling in the dust. She was filled with repulsion.
两个女孩很快就沿着贝尔多弗的主路快步走着，一条宽阔的街道，一半是商店，一半是住宅，完全不成形、肮脏，没有贫穷。古德伦刚刚离开切尔西和苏塞克斯的生活，她对中部地区一个煤矿小镇的这种无定形的丑陋感到残酷地退缩。然而她继续向前走，穿过那条肮脏、琐碎的肮脏街道。她承受着每一道目光的注视，经历了一段痛苦的时光。奇怪的是，她竟然选择回来，测试一下这种无形的、贫瘠的丑陋对自己的影响。为什么她要屈服于这些丑陋、毫无意义的人们、这个被玷污的乡村所遭受的难以忍受的折磨？她感觉自己像一只甲虫，在尘土中辛勤劳作。她心中充满了厌恶。

They turned off the main road, past a black patch of common-garden, where sooty cabbage stumps stood shameless. No one thought to be ashamed. No one was ashamed of it all.
他们拐出了大路，经过一片黑色的普通花园，那里无耻地矗立着乌黑的卷心菜树桩。没有人觉得羞耻。没有人为这一切感到羞耻。

‘It is like a country in an underworld,’ said Gudrun. ‘The colliers bring it above-ground with them, shovel it up. Ursula, it’s marvellous, it’s really marvellous—it’s really wonderful, another world. The people are all ghouls, and everything is ghostly. Everything is a ghoulish replica of the real world, a replica, a ghoul, all soiled, everything sordid. It’s like being mad, Ursula.’
“这就像一个黑社会中的国家，”古德伦说。 “煤矿工人把它带到地面上，把它铲起来。乌苏拉，太棒了，真的太棒了——真的太棒了，另一个世界。人皆喰种，万物皆鬼。一切都是现实世界的可怕复制品，复制品，食尸鬼，一切都是肮脏的，一切都是肮脏的。这就像生气了，乌苏拉。

The sisters were crossing a black path through a dark, soiled field. On the left was a large landscape, a valley with collieries, and opposite hills with cornfields and woods, all blackened with distance, as if seen through a veil of crape. White and black smoke rose up in steady columns, magic within the dark air. Near at hand came the long rows of dwellings, approaching curved up the hill-slope, in straight lines along the brow of the hill. They were of darkened red brick, brittle, with dark slate roofs. The path on which the sisters walked was black, trodden-in by the feet of the recurrent colliers, and bounded from the field by iron fences; the stile that led again into the road was rubbed shiny by the moleskins of the passing miners. Now the two girls were going between some rows of dwellings, of the poorer sort. Women, their arms folded over their coarse aprons, standing gossiping at the end of their block, stared after the Brangwen sisters with that long, unwearying stare of aborigines; children called out names.
姐妹俩正在穿过一片黑暗、肮脏的田野，穿过一条黑色的小路。左边是一大片风景，山谷里有煤矿，对面的山上有玉米地和树林，一切都随着距离而变黑，仿佛透过一层黑纱的面纱看到的。白色和黑色的烟雾稳定地升起，黑暗的空气中充满了魔法。近处是一排排长长的住宅，沿着山坡蜿蜒而上，沿着山脊呈直线排列。它们是用深色的红砖砌成的，很脆，屋顶是深色的石板。姐妹俩走过的小路是黑色的，被经常来往的矿工踩过，田地之间有铁栅栏围着。再次通向道路的栅栏被过往矿工的鼹鼠皮擦得闪闪发亮。现在，两个女孩正在几排较贫穷的住宅之间行走。女人们双臂交叉，围着粗糙的围裙，站在街区的尽头闲聊，用原住民那种长久而不知疲倦的目光盯着布兰文姐妹。孩子们喊出名字。

Gudrun went on her way half dazed. If this were human life, if these were human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own world, outside? She was aware of her grass-green stockings, her large grass-green velour hat, her full soft coat, of a strong blue colour. And she felt as if she were treading in the air, quite unstable, her heart was contracted, as if at any minute she might be precipitated to the ground. She was afraid.
古德伦半茫然地继续前行。如果这就是人类的生活，如果这就是人类，生活在一个完整的世界里，那么她自己的世界在外面又是什么呢？她注意到她的草绿色长袜，她那顶草绿色天鹅绒大帽子，她那件浓蓝色的柔软外套。她感觉自己仿佛踩在空中，很不稳，心脏一紧，仿佛随时都会被摔到地上。她很害怕。

She clung to Ursula, who, through long usage was inured to this violation of a dark, uncreated, hostile world. But all the time her heart was crying, as if in the midst of some ordeal: ‘I want to go back, I want to go away, I want not to know it, not to know that this exists.’ Yet she must go forward.
她紧紧抓住乌苏拉，而乌苏拉在长期的使用中已经习惯了这种对黑暗、非创造、充满敌意的世界的侵犯。但她的心一直在哭泣，仿佛在经历某种磨难：“我想回去，我想离开，我不想知道它，不想知道这个存在。”但她必须走向前。

Ursula could feel her suffering.
乌苏拉能感觉到她的痛苦。

‘You hate this, don’t you?’ she asked.
“你讨厌这个，不是吗？”她问。

‘It bewilders me,’ stammered Gudrun.
“这让我很困惑，”古珍结结巴巴地说。

‘You won’t stay long,’ replied Ursula.
“你不会呆太久的，”乌苏拉回答道。

And Gudrun went along, grasping at release.
古德伦也跟着走，紧紧抓住释放的机会。

They drew away from the colliery region, over the curve of the hill, into the purer country of the other side, towards Willey Green. Still the faint glamour of blackness persisted over the fields and the wooded hills, and seemed darkly to gleam in the air. It was a spring day, chill, with snatches of sunshine. Yellow celandines showed out from the hedge-bottoms, and in the cottage gardens of Willey Green, currant-bushes were breaking into leaf, and little flowers were coming white on the grey alyssum that hung over the stone walls.
他们离开煤矿区，越过山坡，进入另一边更纯净的乡村，向威利·格林驶去。田野和树木繁茂的山丘上仍然笼罩着淡淡的黑色魅力，空气中似乎闪烁着黑暗的光芒。那是一个春日，寒气逼人，阳光明媚。黄色的白屈菜从树篱底部显露出来，在威利格林的村舍花园里，醋栗灌木丛正在长出叶子，石墙上挂着的灰色香薰上开着白色的小花。

Turning, they passed down the high-road, that went between high banks towards the church. There, in the lowest bend of the road, low under the trees, stood a little group of expectant people, waiting to see the wedding. The daughter of the chief mine-owner of the district, Thomas Crich, was getting married to a naval officer.
他们转身穿过高高的河岸之间的大路，朝教堂走去。在那里，在道路最低的拐弯处，低低的树下，站着一小群满怀期待的人们，等待着观看婚礼。该地区主要矿主托马斯·克里奇的女儿即将与一名海军军官结婚。

‘Let us go back,’ said Gudrun, swerving away. ‘There are all those people.’
“我们回去吧，”戈珍说着，转身走开了。 “都是这些人。”

And she hung wavering in the road.
她摇摇晃晃地悬在路上。

‘Never mind them,’ said Ursula, ‘they’re all right. They all know me, they don’t matter.’
“别管他们，”乌苏拉说，“他们都很好。”他们都认识我，他们并不重要。

‘But must we go through them?’ asked Gudrun.
“但是我们必须经过它们吗？”古德伦问道。

‘They’re quite all right, really,’ said Ursula, going forward. And together the two sisters approached the group of uneasy, watchful common people. They were chiefly women, colliers’ wives of the more shiftless sort. They had watchful, underworld faces.
“他们真的很好，”乌苏拉向前走着说道。两姐妹一起走近这群不安、警惕的普通民众。她们主要是女性，是煤矿工人的妻子，属于比较无能的类型。他们有着警惕的、阴暗的面孔。

The two sisters held themselves tense, and went straight towards the gate. The women made way for them, but barely sufficient, as if grudging to yield ground. The sisters passed in silence through the stone gateway and up the steps, on the red carpet, a policeman estimating their progress.
姐妹二人绷着脸，径直朝大门走去。女人们为他们让路，但勉强够用，仿佛不情愿地让路。姐妹俩默默地穿过石门，走上红地毯上的台阶，一名警察估量着她们的进展情况。

‘What price the stockings!’ said a voice at the back of Gudrun. A sudden fierce anger swept over the girl, violent and murderous. She would have liked them all annihilated, cleared away, so that the world was left clear for her. How she hated walking up the churchyard path, along the red carpet, continuing in motion, in their sight.
“这双袜子值多少钱！”古德伦身后传来一个声音。一股猛烈的怒火突然席卷少女全身，狂暴而杀气十足。她希望他们都被消灭、清除，这样世界就对她来说是干净的。她多么讨厌沿着教堂墓地的小路，沿着红地毯，在他们的视线中继续前行。

‘I won’t go into the church,’ she said suddenly, with such final decision that Ursula immediately halted, turned round, and branched off up a small side path which led to the little private gate of the Grammar School, whose grounds adjoined those of the church.
“我不会进教堂的。”她突然说道，她的最终决定使乌苏拉立即停下来，转过身来，沿着一条小路分岔，通向文法学校的私人小门，学校的场地毗邻那些教会的。

Just inside the gate of the school shrubbery, outside the churchyard, Ursula sat down for a moment on the low stone wall under the laurel bushes, to rest. Behind her, the large red building of the school rose up peacefully, the windows all open for the holiday. Over the shrubs, before her, were the pale roofs and tower of the old church. The sisters were hidden by the foliage.
就在教堂墓地外的学校灌木丛大门内，乌苏拉在月桂树丛下的矮石墙上坐了一会儿，休息了一会儿。在她身后，学校那座红色的大楼安静地拔地而起，窗户全开着迎接节日。灌木丛上方，她面前是古老教堂的苍白屋顶和塔楼。姐妹俩被树叶遮住了。

Gudrun sat down in silence. Her mouth was shut close, her face averted. She was regretting bitterly that she had ever come back. Ursula looked at her, and thought how amazingly beautiful she was, flushed with discomfiture. But she caused a constraint over Ursula’s nature, a certain weariness. Ursula wished to be alone, freed from the tightness, the enclosure of Gudrun’s presence.
古德伦默默地坐下来。她的嘴闭着，脸别开。她非常后悔自己当初回来了。乌苏拉看着她，心想她是多么美丽，她因不安而涨红了脸。但她对乌苏拉的本性造成了限制，造成了某种厌倦。乌苏拉希望独自一人，摆脱古德伦存在的束缚和束缚。

‘Are we going to stay here?’ asked Gudrun.
“我们要留在这里吗？”古德伦问道。

‘I was only resting a minute,’ said Ursula, getting up as if rebuked. ‘We will stand in the corner by the fives-court, we shall see everything from there.’
“我只休息了一分钟，”乌苏拉说着，站了起来，仿佛受到了斥责。 “我们将站在五人制球场的角落里，我们将从那里看到一切。”

For the moment, the sunshine fell brightly into the churchyard, there was a vague scent of sap and of spring, perhaps of violets from off the graves. Some white daisies were out, bright as angels. In the air, the unfolding leaves of a copper-beech were blood-red.
此刻，阳光明亮地照进教堂墓地，隐隐约约有一股树液和春天的气味，也许是坟墓里的紫罗兰的气味。一些白色的雏菊开放了，像天使一样明亮。空气中，铜山毛榉展开的叶子呈血红色。

Punctually at eleven o’clock, the carriages began to arrive. There was a stir in the crowd at the gate, a concentration as a carriage drove up, wedding guests were mounting up the steps and passing along the red carpet to the church. They were all gay and excited because the sun was shining.
十一点准时，马车陆续抵达。门口人群一阵骚动，当一辆马车驶来时，人群开始集中，参加婚礼的宾客们走上台阶，沿着红地毯走向教堂。因为阳光明媚，他们都兴高采烈、兴奋不已。

Gudrun watched them closely, with objective curiosity. She saw each one as a complete figure, like a character in a book, or a subject in a picture, or a marionette in a theatre, a finished creation. She loved to recognise their various characteristics, to place them in their true light, give them their own surroundings, settle them for ever as they passed before her along the path to the church. She knew them, they were finished, sealed and stamped and finished with, for her. There was none that had anything unknown, unresolved, until the Criches themselves began to appear. Then her interest was piqued. Here was something not quite so preconcluded.
古德伦带着客观的好奇心仔细地观察着他们。她将每一个人物视为一个完整的人物，就像书中的人物、图片中的主题、剧院中的木偶，一个完成的创作。她喜欢认识他们的各种特征，将他们置于真实的光中，给他们自己的环境，当他们沿着通往教堂的道路在她面前经过时，让他们永远定居下来。她认识它们，它们已经完成、密封、盖章、完成，是为了她。没有任何事情是未知的、未解决的，直到克里奇们本身开始出现。然后她的兴趣就被勾起来了。事情并非如此预先定论。

There came the mother, Mrs Crich, with her eldest son Gerald. She was a queer unkempt figure, in spite of the attempts that had obviously been made to bring her into line for the day. Her face was pale, yellowish, with a clear, transparent skin, she leaned forward rather, her features were strongly marked, handsome, with a tense, unseeing, predative look. Her colourless hair was untidy, wisps floating down on to her sac coat of dark blue silk, from under her blue silk hat. She looked like a woman with a monomania, furtive almost, but heavily proud.
母亲克里奇夫人带着她的长子杰拉尔德来了。她是一个奇怪的、蓬头垢面的人物，尽管今天显然已经尽力让她遵守规矩。她的脸色苍白，泛黄，皮肤白皙透明，身体前倾，五官轮廓分明，英俊，带着一种紧张、茫然、掠夺的神情。她那无色的头发凌乱不堪，一缕缕头发从蓝色丝绸帽子下面飘落到深蓝色丝囊外衣上。她看起来就像一个偏执狂的女人，几乎偷偷摸摸，但又非常骄傲。

Her son was of a fair, sun-tanned type, rather above middle height, well-made, and almost exaggeratedly well-dressed. But about him also was the strange, guarded look, the unconscious glisten, as if he did not belong to the same creation as the people about him. Gudrun lighted on him at once. There was something northern about him that magnetised her. In his clear northern flesh and his fair hair was a glisten like sunshine refracted through crystals of ice. And he looked so new, unbroached, pure as an arctic thing. Perhaps he was thirty years old, perhaps more. His gleaming beauty, maleness, like a young, good-humoured, smiling wolf, did not blind her to the significant, sinister stillness in his bearing, the lurking danger of his unsubdued temper. ‘His totem is the wolf,’ she repeated to herself. ‘His mother is an old, unbroken wolf.’ And then she experienced a keen paroxyism, a transport, as if she had made some incredible discovery, known to nobody else on earth. A strange transport took possession of her, all her veins were in a paroxysm of violent sensation. ‘Good God!’ she exclaimed to herself, ‘what is this?’ And then, a moment after, she was saying assuredly, ‘I shall know more of that man.’ She was tortured with desire to see him again, a nostalgia, a necessity to see him again, to make sure it was not all a mistake, that she was not deluding herself, that she really felt this strange and overwhelming sensation on his account, this knowledge of him in her essence, this powerful apprehension of him. ‘Am I REALLY singled out for him in some way, is there really some pale gold, arctic light that envelopes only us two?’ she asked herself. And she could not believe it, she remained in a muse, scarcely conscious of what was going on around.
她的儿子皮肤白皙，皮肤晒黑了，中等以上的身高，身材匀称，衣着得体得近乎夸张。但他身上也有一种奇怪的、戒备的表情，无意识的光芒，仿佛他与周围的人不属于同一个创造物。古德伦立即将目光投向他。他身上有一种北方的气质让她着迷。他那清澈的北方肌肤和金色的头发闪烁着阳光般的光芒，就像透过冰晶折射的阳光一样。他看起来那么新鲜，没有任何修饰，像北极的东西一样纯洁。也许他已经三十岁了，也许更多。他闪闪发光的美貌、男性气概，就像一头年轻、幽默、微笑的狼，并没有让她看不到他举止中显着的、险恶的平静，以及他不驯服的脾气中潜在的危险。 “他的图腾是狼，”她对自己重复道。 “他的母亲是一头年老的、完好无损的狼。”然后她经历了一种强烈的阵发，一种兴奋，仿佛她有了一些地球上没有人知道的令人难以置信的发现。一种奇怪的感觉占据了她的心，她所有的血管都爆发出强烈的感觉。 “天啊！”她自言自语道，“这是什么？”过了一会儿，她笃定地说：“我会对那个男人有更多的了解。”她被想再次见到他的渴望所折磨，一种怀旧之情。她有必要再次见到他，以确保这一切不全是一个错误，她没有欺骗自己，她确实因为他而感受到了这种奇怪而压倒性的感觉，这种对他本质的了解，这种对他的强烈理解他。 “我真的在某种程度上被他挑出来了吗？真的有一些淡金色的北极光只笼罩着我们两个吗？”她问自己。她简直不敢相信，她陷入了沉思，几乎没有意识到周围发生了什么。

The bridesmaids were here, and yet the bridegroom had not come. Ursula wondered if something was amiss, and if the wedding would yet all go wrong. She felt troubled, as if it rested upon her. The chief bridesmaids had arrived. Ursula watched them come up the steps. One of them she knew, a tall, slow, reluctant woman with a weight of fair hair and a pale, long face. This was Hermione Roddice, a friend of the Criches. Now she came along, with her head held up, balancing an enormous flat hat of pale yellow velvet, on which were streaks of ostrich feathers, natural and grey. She drifted forward as if scarcely conscious, her long blanched face lifted up, not to see the world. She was rich. She wore a dress of silky, frail velvet, of pale yellow colour, and she carried a lot of small rose-coloured cyclamens. Her shoes and stockings were of brownish grey, like the feathers on her hat, her hair was heavy, she drifted along with a peculiar fixity of the hips, a strange unwilling motion. She was impressive, in her lovely pale-yellow and brownish-rose, yet macabre, something repulsive. People were silent when she passed, impressed, roused, wanting to jeer, yet for some reason silenced. Her long, pale face, that she carried lifted up, somewhat in the Rossetti fashion, seemed almost drugged, as if a strange mass of thoughts coiled in the darkness within her, and she was never allowed to escape.
伴娘都到了，新郎却还没有来。乌苏拉想知道是否出了什么问题，婚礼是否会出现问题。她感到很烦恼，好像这件事压在她身上一样。首席伴娘已经到了。乌苏拉看着他们走上台阶。其中一个她认识，是一位身材高大、行动迟缓、不情愿的女人，一头浓密的金发和一张苍白的长脸。这是赫敏·罗迪斯，克里奇夫妇的朋友。现在她走了过来，抬起头，平衡着一顶巨大的淡黄色天鹅绒平顶帽子，帽子上有几条鸵鸟羽毛，自然的灰色。她向前飘去，仿佛几乎没有知觉，苍白的长脸抬起来，不去看这个世界。她很富有。她穿着一件淡黄色的丝质轻质天鹅绒连衣裙，手里拿着很多玫瑰色的小仙客来。她的鞋子和袜子是棕灰色的，就像她帽子上的羽毛一样，她的头发很浓密，她的臀部有一种特殊的固定状态，一种奇怪的不情愿的动作。她穿着可爱的浅黄色和棕玫瑰色的衣服，令人印象深刻，但又令人毛骨悚然，令人厌恶。当她经过时，人们都沉默了，有感动，有兴奋，有想嘲笑，但又不知为何又沉默了。她那张苍白的长脸，有点像罗塞蒂那样抬起来，看上去几乎像是被下了药，仿佛一团奇怪的思绪盘绕在她内心的黑暗中，而她却永远不被允许逃脱。

Ursula watched her with fascination. She knew her a little. She was the most remarkable woman in the Midlands. Her father was a Derbyshire Baronet of the old school, she was a woman of the new school, full of intellectuality, and heavy, nerve-worn with consciousness. She was passionately interested in reform, her soul was given up to the public cause. But she was a man’s woman, it was the manly world that held her.
乌苏拉着迷地看着她。她对她有些了解。她是中部地区最杰出的女性。她的父亲是一位旧派的德比郡男爵，而她则是一位新派的女性，充满知性，但又沉重、神经质、意识强。她对改革充满热情，她的灵魂献身于公共事业。但她是一个男人的女人，是男人的世界束缚了她。

She had various intimacies of mind and soul with various men of capacity. Ursula knew, among these men, only Rupert Birkin, who was one of the school-inspectors of the county. But Gudrun had met others, in London. Moving with her artist friends in different kinds of society, Gudrun had already come to know a good many people of repute and standing. She had met Hermione twice, but they did not take to each other. It would be queer to meet again down here in the Midlands, where their social standing was so diverse, after they had known each other on terms of equality in the houses of sundry acquaintances in town. For Gudrun had been a social success, and had her friends among the slack aristocracy that keeps touch with the arts.
她与各种有能力的男人有着各种思想和灵魂上的亲密关系。在这些人中，乌苏拉只认识鲁珀特·伯金，他是该县的学校督学之一。但古德伦在伦敦遇到了其他人。古德伦与她的艺术家朋友们生活在不同的社会中，她已经认识了很多有声望和地位的人。她见过赫敏两次，但他们并不喜欢对方。他们在镇上各路熟人的家里平等相识之后，在中部地区再次见面会显得很奇怪，因为那里的社会地位如此不同。因为古德伦在社会上取得了成功，她的朋友都是与艺术保持联系的闲散贵族。

Hermione knew herself to be well-dressed; she knew herself to be the social equal, if not far the superior, of anyone she was likely to meet in Willey Green. She knew she was accepted in the world of culture and of intellect. She was a KULTURTRAGER, a medium for the culture of ideas. With all that was highest, whether in society or in thought or in public action, or even in art, she was at one, she moved among the foremost, at home with them. No one could put her down, no one could make mock of her, because she stood among the first, and those that were against her were below her, either in rank, or in wealth, or in high association of thought and progress and understanding. So, she was invulnerable. All her life, she had sought to make herself invulnerable, unassailable, beyond reach of the world’s judgment.
赫敏知道自己穿着得体。她知道自己的社会地位与她在威利格林可能遇到的任何人相比，即使不是高出很多，也是平等的。她知道她在文化和智力世界中得到了接受。她是一位 KULTUTRAGER，一种思想文化的媒介。对于一切最高的事物，无论是在社会、思想、公共行动，甚至在艺术方面，她都处于其中，她跻身最前沿，与他们融为一体。没有人可以贬低她，没有人可以嘲笑她，因为她属于第一，而那些反对她的人，无论是在地位上，还是在财富上，或者在思想、进步和理解上的高度结合上，都在她之下。 。所以，她是刀枪不入的。她一生都在努力让自己无懈可击，无懈可击，不受世人的评判。

And yet her soul was tortured, exposed. Even walking up the path to the church, confident as she was that in every respect she stood beyond all vulgar judgment, knowing perfectly that her appearance was complete and perfect, according to the first standards, yet she suffered a torture, under her confidence and her pride, feeling herself exposed to wounds and to mockery and to despite. She always felt vulnerable, vulnerable, there was always a secret chink in her armour. She did not know herself what it was. It was a lack of robust self, she had no natural sufficiency, there was a terrible void, a lack, a deficiency of being within her.
然而她的灵魂却受到折磨、暴露。即使走上教堂的小路，尽管她自信地认为自己在各个方面都超越了所有粗俗的判断，完全知道自己的外表按照第一标准是完整和完美的，但她却在她的自信和自信下遭受了折磨。她的骄傲，感觉自己遭受创伤、嘲笑和蔑视。她总是感到脆弱，脆弱，她的盔甲上总有一个秘密的缝隙。她自己也不知道那是什么。这是缺乏坚强的自我，她没有天生的自给自足，她内心有一种可怕的空虚、匮乏、缺乏。

And she wanted someone to close up this deficiency, to close it up for ever. She craved for Rupert Birkin. When he was there, she felt complete, she was sufficient, whole. For the rest of time she was established on the sand, built over a chasm, and, in spite of all her vanity and securities, any common maid-servant of positive, robust temper could fling her down this bottomless pit of insufficiency, by the slightest movement of jeering or contempt. And all the while the pensive, tortured woman piled up her own defences of aesthetic knowledge, and culture, and world-visions, and disinterestedness. Yet she could never stop up the terrible gap of insufficiency.
她希望有人能够弥补这个缺陷，永远弥补它。她渴望鲁珀特·伯金。当他在那里时，她感到完整、充实、完整。在剩下的时间里，她就安顿在沙滩上，建在一道裂缝上，尽管她很虚荣，也很安全，但任何一个脾气积极、脾气暴躁的普通女仆都可能把她扔进这个不足的无底洞，最轻微的嘲笑或蔑视的动作。一直以来，这位沉思、饱受折磨的女人都在为自己的美学知识、文化、世界观和无私辩护。然而她永远无法弥补不足的可怕差距。

If only Birkin would form a close and abiding connection with her, she would be safe during this fretful voyage of life. He could make her sound and triumphant, triumphant over the very angels of heaven. If only he would do it! But she was tortured with fear, with misgiving. She made herself beautiful, she strove so hard to come to that degree of beauty and advantage, when he should be convinced. But always there was a deficiency.
如果伯金能与她建立密切而持久的联系，她在这段令人烦恼的人生旅程中就会安全。他可以让她听起来充满胜利感，甚至战胜天上的天使。如果他愿意的话就好了！但她却被恐惧、疑虑所折磨。她让自己变得美丽，她如此努力地达到那种程度的美丽和优势，而他应该被说服。但总有不足之处。

He was perverse too. He fought her off, he always fought her off. The more she strove to bring him to her, the more he battled her back. And they had been lovers now, for years. Oh, it was so wearying, so aching; she was so tired. But still she believed in herself. She knew he was trying to leave her. She knew he was trying to break away from her finally, to be free. But still she believed in her strength to keep him, she believed in her own higher knowledge. His own knowledge was high, she was the central touchstone of truth. She only needed his conjunction with her.
他也很乖僻。他击退了她，他总是击退她。她越是努力把他带到她身边，他就越是反抗她。现在他们已经是恋人了很多年了。哦，真是太累了，太痛苦了；她太累了。但她仍然相信自己。她知道他想离开她。她知道他最终是想脱离她，想要获得自由。但她仍然相信自己有力量留住他，她相信自己更高的知识。他自己的知识渊博，她是真理的中心试金石。她只需要他与她的结合。

And this, this conjunction with her, which was his highest fulfilment also, with the perverseness of a wilful child he wanted to deny. With the wilfulness of an obstinate child, he wanted to break the holy connection that was between them.
而这，与她的结合，也是他最高的成就，他想要否认一个任性孩子的任性。他以一个顽固孩子的任性，想要打破他们之间的神圣联系。

He would be at this wedding; he was to be groom’s man. He would be in the church, waiting. He would know when she came. She shuddered with nervous apprehension and desire as she went through the church-door. He would be there, surely he would see how beautiful her dress was, surely he would see how she had made herself beautiful for him. He would understand, he would be able to see how she was made for him, the first, how she was, for him, the highest. Surely at last he would be able to accept his highest fate, he would not deny her.
他会参加这场婚礼；他将成为新郎的伴郎。他会在教堂里等待。她什么时候来他就会知道。当她走进教堂大门时，她因紧张的忧虑和渴望而颤抖。他会在那里，他肯定会看到她的衣服有多漂亮，他肯定会看到她如何为他打扮得漂亮。他会明白，他会看到她是如何为他而生的，第一个，她对他来说是如何最高的。他最终肯定能接受他最高的命运，他不会否认她。

In a little convulsion of too-tired yearning, she entered the church and looked slowly along her cheeks for him, her slender body convulsed with agitation. As best man, he would be standing beside the altar. She looked slowly, deferring in her certainty.
她因过于疲惫的渴望而微微抽搐，走进教堂，慢慢地顺着脸颊寻找他，纤细的身体因激动而颤抖。作为伴郎，他会站在祭坛旁边。她缓慢地看着，带着坚定的态度。

And then, he was not there. A terrible storm came over her, as if she were drowning. She was possessed by a devastating hopelessness. And she approached mechanically to the altar. Never had she known such a pang of utter and final hopelessness. It was beyond death, so utterly null, desert.
然后，他就不在那儿了。一场可怕的风暴向她袭来，她仿佛被淹没了。她被一种毁灭性的绝望所占据。她机械地走向祭坛。她从来没有经历过如此彻底、彻底的绝望的痛苦。这是超越死亡的、完全空虚的沙漠。

The bridegroom and the groom’s man had not yet come. There was a growing consternation outside. Ursula felt almost responsible. She could not bear it that the bride should arrive, and no groom. The wedding must not be a fiasco, it must not.
新郎和伴郎还没有来。外面的惊愕声越来越大。乌苏拉觉得自己几乎要负起责任。她无法忍受新娘到来，而新郎却不见踪影。婚礼不能是一场惨败，绝对不能。

But here was the bride’s carriage, adorned with ribbons and cockades. Gaily the grey horses curvetted to their destination at the church-gate, a laughter in the whole movement. Here was the quick of all laughter and pleasure. The door of the carriage was thrown open, to let out the very blossom of the day. The people on the roadway murmured faintly with the discontented murmuring of a crowd.
但这是新娘的马车，装饰着丝带和徽章。灰马欢快地曲着曲线奔向教堂门口的目的地，整个运动充满了笑声。这里是所有欢笑和快乐的源泉。马车的门被推开，让当天的花朵散发出来。巷子里的人们带着人群不满的嘀咕声微弱地议论着。

The father stepped out first into the air of the morning, like a shadow. He was a tall, thin, careworn man, with a thin black beard that was touched with grey. He waited at the door of the carriage patiently, self-obliterated.
父亲像影子一样第一个踏入早晨的空气中。他是个又高又瘦、忧心忡忡的男人，稀疏的黑色胡须中夹杂着灰色。他耐心地等在马车门口，自我毁灭。

In the opening of the doorway was a shower of fine foliage and flowers, a whiteness of satin and lace, and a sound of a gay voice saying:
门口铺满了精美的树叶和花朵，白色的缎子和蕾丝，还有一个欢快的声音说道：

‘How do I get out?’
“我怎么出去？”

A ripple of satisfaction ran through the expectant people. They pressed near to receive her, looking with zest at the stooping blond head with its flower buds, and at the delicate, white, tentative foot that was reaching down to the step of the carriage. There was a sudden foaming rush, and the bride like a sudden surf-rush, floating all white beside her father in the morning shadow of trees, her veil flowing with laughter.
期待的人们心中涌起一阵满足的涟漪。他们挤近来迎接她，热情地看着那带着花蕾的弯腰金发头，还有那双娇嫩、雪白、试探性地伸向马车踏板的脚。突然，泡沫涌动起来，新娘像突然的海浪一样，在早晨的树影中，全身白色地漂浮在她父亲身边，她的面纱随着笑声飘扬。

‘That’s done it!’ she said.
“就这样了！”她说。

She put her hand on the arm of her care-worn, sallow father, and frothing her light draperies, proceeded over the eternal red carpet. Her father, mute and yellowish, his black beard making him look more careworn, mounted the steps stiffly, as if his spirit were absent; but the laughing mist of the bride went along with him undiminished.
她把手搭在饱受忧虑、脸色蜡黄的父亲的手臂上，掀起轻薄的窗帘，走上永恒的红地毯。她的父亲沉默寡言，脸色发黄，黑色的胡须让他看起来更加忧心忡忡，他僵硬地走上台阶，仿佛精神恍惚。但新娘的笑意却丝毫不减地跟着他。

And no bridegroom had arrived! It was intolerable for her. Ursula, her heart strained with anxiety, was watching the hill beyond; the white, descending road, that should give sight of him. There was a carriage. It was running. It had just come into sight. Yes, it was he. Ursula turned towards the bride and the people, and, from her place of vantage, gave an inarticulate cry. She wanted to warn them that he was coming. But her cry was inarticulate and inaudible, and she flushed deeply, between her desire and her wincing confusion.
而且新郎还没有到来！这对她来说是无法忍受的。乌苏拉的心因焦虑而紧张，她注视着远处的山丘。白色的、向下的道路，应该可以看到他。有一辆马车。它正在运行。它刚刚映入眼帘。是的，就是他。乌苏拉转向新娘和众人，从她有利的位置发出一声含糊的叫喊。她想警告他们他要来了。但她的哭声含糊不清，听不见，她的脸涨得通红，在她的欲望和她畏缩的困惑之间。

The carriage rattled down the hill, and drew near. There was a shout from the people. The bride, who had just reached the top of the steps, turned round gaily to see what was the commotion. She saw a confusion among the people, a cab pulling up, and her lover dropping out of the carriage, and dodging among the horses and into the crowd.
马车轰隆隆地下了山，越来越近了。人群中传来一阵呼喊声。刚刚登上台阶顶端的新娘高兴地转过头来看看发生了什么事。她看见人群一片混乱，一辆马车停了下来，她的爱人从马车上掉下来，躲在马匹和人群中。

‘Tibs! Tibs!’ she cried in her sudden, mocking excitement, standing high on the path in the sunlight and waving her bouquet. He, dodging with his hat in his hand, had not heard.
‘蒂布斯！蒂布斯！”她突然兴奋地喊道，在阳光下高高地站在小路上，挥舞着她的花束。他手里拿着帽子躲闪着，没有听到。

‘Tibs!’ she cried again, looking down to him.
“蒂布斯！”她再次喊道，低头看着他。

He glanced up, unaware, and saw the bride and her father standing on the path above him. A queer, startled look went over his face. He hesitated for a moment. Then he gathered himself together for a leap, to overtake her.
他毫无察觉地抬起头，看到新娘和她的父亲站在他上方的小路上。他的脸上浮现出一种奇怪的、惊讶的表情。他犹豫了片刻。然后他振作起来，纵身一跃，追上了她。

‘Ah-h-h!’ came her strange, intaken cry, as, on the reflex, she started, turned and fled, scudding with an unthinkable swift beating of her white feet and fraying of her white garments, towards the church. Like a hound the young man was after her, leaping the steps and swinging past her father, his supple haunches working like those of a hound that bears down on the quarry.
“啊——啊——啊！”她发出奇怪的、被吸入的叫声，她本能地惊慌失措，转身逃跑，用难以想象的迅捷的脚步和磨损的白衣向教堂飞奔而去。年轻人像一只猎犬一样追赶着她，跳过台阶，从她父亲身边晃过，他柔软的腰部像猎犬扑向猎物一样。

‘Ay, after her!’ cried the vulgar women below, carried suddenly into the sport.
“哎呀，追她！”下面那些粗俗的女人喊道，她们突然投入了这场运动。

She, her flowers shaken from her like froth, was steadying herself to turn the angle of the church. She glanced behind, and with a wild cry of laughter and challenge, veered, poised, and was gone beyond the grey stone buttress. In another instant the bridegroom, bent forward as he ran, had caught the angle of the silent stone with his hand, and had swung himself out of sight, his supple, strong loins vanishing in pursuit.
她的花像泡沫一样从身上抖落，她正稳住身子，准备转动教堂的角度。她回头看了一眼，带着一阵狂野的笑声和挑战，转身，泰然自若地越过了灰色的石壁。转眼之间，新郎边跑边弯着腰，用手抓住了那块沉默的石头的角度，一转就消失在了人们的视线中，他那柔软而有力的腰肢在追赶中消失了。

Instantly cries and exclamations of excitement burst from the crowd at the gate. And then Ursula noticed again the dark, rather stooping figure of Mr Crich, waiting suspended on the path, watching with expressionless face the flight to the church. It was over, and he turned round to look behind him, at the figure of Rupert Birkin, who at once came forward and joined him.
门口的人群顿时爆发出兴奋的叫喊声和惊呼声。然后乌苏拉又注意到克里奇先生那黝黑、弯腰的身影，悬浮在小路上等待着，面无表情地注视着飞往教堂的航班。一切都结束了，他转身看向身后，看到了鲁珀特·伯金的身影，后者立刻走上前来，加入了他的行列。

‘We’ll bring up the rear,’ said Birkin, a faint smile on his face.
“我们会在后面，”伯金说道，脸上挂着淡淡的微笑。

‘Ay!’ replied the father laconically. And the two men turned together up the path.
“嗯！”父亲简洁地回答道。两个人一起转身走上小路。

Birkin was as thin as Mr Crich, pale and ill-looking. His figure was narrow but nicely made. He went with a slight trail of one foot, which came only from self-consciousness. Although he was dressed correctly for his part, yet there was an innate incongruity which caused a slight ridiculousness in his appearance. His nature was clever and separate, he did not fit at all in the conventional occasion. Yet he subordinated himself to the common idea, travestied himself.
伯金和克里奇先生一样瘦弱，脸色苍白，面色难看。他的身形虽窄，但身材却很优美。他的一只脚轻轻地拖着脚步，那只是出于自我意识。虽然他的穿着很得体，但是却有一种与生俱来的不协调，让他的外表显得有些滑稽。他生性聪明，性格孤僻，与传统场合格格不入。然而他却屈服于普遍观念，嘲讽了自己。

He affected to be quite ordinary, perfectly and marvellously commonplace. And he did it so well, taking the tone of his surroundings, adjusting himself quickly to his interlocutor and his circumstance, that he achieved a verisimilitude of ordinary commonplaceness that usually propitiated his onlookers for the moment, disarmed them from attacking his singleness.
他假装自己很普通，非常普通，而且非常普通。他做得非常好，适应了周围环境的基调，迅速调整自己以适应对话者和自己的处境，以至于他实现了一种逼真的平淡无奇，这通常会暂时安抚他的旁观者，让他们不再攻击他的单身。

Now he spoke quite easily and pleasantly to Mr Crich, as they walked along the path; he played with situations like a man on a tight-rope: but always on a tight-rope, pretending nothing but ease.
现在，当他们沿着小路行走时，他很轻松愉快地与克里奇先生交谈。他处理各种情况就像一个走钢丝的人：但总是走钢丝，假装除了轻松之外什么也没做。

‘I’m sorry we are so late,’ he was saying. ‘We couldn’t find a button-hook, so it took us a long time to button our boots. But you were to the moment.’
“很抱歉我们来得太晚了，”他说道。 “我们找不到纽扣钩，所以我们花了很长时间才扣上靴子的扣子。但你已经到了这一刻。

‘We are usually to time,’ said Mr Crich.
“我们通常都会准时，”克里奇先生说。

‘And I’m always late,’ said Birkin. ‘But today I was REALLY punctual, only accidentally not so. I’m sorry.’
“我总是迟到，”伯金说。 “但今天我真的很准时，只是不小心没有准时。”对不起。'

The two men were gone, there was nothing more to see, for the time. Ursula was left thinking about Birkin. He piqued her, attracted her, and annoyed her.
两个人已经走了，暂时也没什么可看的了。乌苏拉（Ursula）只想着伯金（Birkin）。他激怒了她，吸引了她，也惹恼了她。

She wanted to know him more. She had spoken with him once or twice, but only in his official capacity as inspector. She thought he seemed to acknowledge some kinship between her and him, a natural, tacit understanding, a using of the same language. But there had been no time for the understanding to develop. And something kept her from him, as well as attracted her to him. There was a certain hostility, a hidden ultimate reserve in him, cold and inaccessible.
她想更多地了解他。她曾与他交谈过一两次，但只是以他作为检查员的官方身份。她觉得他似乎承认她和他之间有某种亲缘关系，一种自然的默契，一种共同的语言。但没有时间发展理解。有什么东西让她远离他，同时又吸引她到他身边。他身上有一种敌意，一种隐藏的终极保留，冷漠而难以接近。

Yet she wanted to know him.
但她还是想认识他。

‘What do you think of Rupert Birkin?’ she asked, a little reluctantly, of Gudrun. She did not want to discuss him.
“你觉得鲁珀特·伯金怎么样？”她有点不情愿地问古德伦。她不想讨论他。

‘What do I think of Rupert Birkin?’ repeated Gudrun. ‘I think he’s attractive—decidedly attractive. What I can’t stand about him is his way with other people—his way of treating any little fool as if she were his greatest consideration. One feels so awfully sold, oneself.’
“我觉得鲁珀特·伯金怎么样？”古德伦重复道。 “我认为他很有魅力——绝对有魅力。我不能忍受他的是他对待别人的方式——他对待任何一个小傻瓜的方式都好像她是他最大的考虑。一个人感觉自己被出卖了，非常糟糕。

‘Why does he do it?’ said Ursula.
“他为什么这么做？”乌苏拉说。

‘Because he has no real critical faculty—of people, at all events,’ said Gudrun. ‘I tell you, he treats any little fool as he treats me or you—and it’s such an insult.’
“因为他没有真正的批判能力——无论如何，”古德伦说。 “我告诉你，他对待任何一个小傻瓜就像对待我或你一样——这真是一种侮辱。”

‘Oh, it is,’ said Ursula. ‘One must discriminate.’
“哦，是的，”乌苏拉说。 “人必须有歧视。”

‘One MUST discriminate,’ repeated Gudrun. ‘But he’s a wonderful chap, in other respects—a marvellous personality. But you can’t trust him.’
“人必须歧视，”古德伦重复道。 “但从其他方面来看，他是一个很棒的小伙子——一个了不起的个性。但你不能相信他。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula vaguely. She was always forced to assent to Gudrun’s pronouncements, even when she was not in accord altogether.
“是的，”乌苏拉含糊地说。她总是被迫同意古德伦的声明，即使她并不完全同意。

The sisters sat silent, waiting for the wedding party to come out. Gudrun was impatient of talk. She wanted to think about Gerald Crich. She wanted to see if the strong feeling she had got from him was real. She wanted to have herself ready.
姐妹俩默默地坐着，等待婚礼的到来。古德伦不耐烦说话。她想想想杰拉尔德·克里奇。她想看看，她从他身上得到的强烈感觉是不是真的。她想让自己做好准备。

Inside the church, the wedding was going on. Hermione Roddice was thinking only of Birkin. He stood near her. She seemed to gravitate physically towards him. She wanted to stand touching him. She could hardly be sure he was near her, if she did not touch him. Yet she stood subjected through the wedding service.
教堂内，婚礼正在进行。赫敏·罗迪斯只想着柏金包。他站在她身边。她似乎在身体上被他吸引。她想站起来触碰他。如果她不碰他，她几乎无法确定他就在她身边。然而，在婚礼仪式上，她始终处于屈服状态。

She had suffered so bitterly when he did not come, that still she was dazed. Still she was gnawed as by a neuralgia, tormented by his potential absence from her. She had awaited him in a faint delirium of nervous torture. As she stood bearing herself pensively, the rapt look on her face, that seemed spiritual, like the angels, but which came from torture, gave her a certain poignancy that tore his heart with pity. He saw her bowed head, her rapt face, the face of an almost demoniacal ecstatic. Feeling him looking, she lifted her face and sought his eyes, her own beautiful grey eyes flaring him a great signal. But he avoided her look, she sank her head in torment and shame, the gnawing at her heart going on. And he too was tortured with shame, and ultimate dislike, and with acute pity for her, because he did not want to meet her eyes, he did not want to receive her flare of recognition.
他没有来，她心里非常痛苦，所以她仍然茫然若失。但她仍然像神经痛一样痛苦，因为他可能不在她身边而备受折磨。她在神经折磨的微弱谵妄中等待着他。当她站在那里若有所思时，她脸上全神贯注的表情，看起来像天使一样充满灵性，但却来自折磨，给了她某种辛酸的感觉，让他的心因怜悯而撕裂。他看到她低着头，全神贯注的脸，一张近乎恶魔般的狂喜的脸。感觉到他在看她，她抬起脸寻找他的眼睛，她美丽的灰色眼睛向他发出了一个强烈的信号。但他避开了她的目光，她痛苦羞愧地低下了头，心继续被啃咬。他也被羞耻和极度的厌恶所折磨，对她充满了强烈的怜悯，因为他不想面对她的眼睛，他不想接受她的认可。

The bride and bridegroom were married, the party went into the vestry. Hermione crowded involuntarily up against Birkin, to touch him. And he endured it.
新娘和新郎结婚了，一行人走进了圣堂。赫敏不由自主地挤到伯金身边，想要触碰他。他忍受了。

Outside, Gudrun and Ursula listened for their father’s playing on the organ. He would enjoy playing a wedding march. Now the married pair were coming! The bells were ringing, making the air shake. Ursula wondered if the trees and the flowers could feel the vibration, and what they thought of it, this strange motion in the air. The bride was quite demure on the arm of the bridegroom, who stared up into the sky before him, shutting and opening his eyes unconsciously, as if he were neither here nor there. He looked rather comical, blinking and trying to be in the scene, when emotionally he was violated by his exposure to a crowd. He looked a typical naval officer, manly, and up to his duty.
外面，古德伦和乌苏拉聆听父亲演奏风琴。他喜欢演奏婚礼进行曲。现在，已婚夫妇来了！钟声响起，让空气都为之震动。乌苏拉想知道树木和花朵是否能感受到这种振动，以及它们对空气中这种奇怪运动的看法。新娘挽着新郎的手臂，十分端庄，新郎抬头望着眼前的天空，眼睛不自觉地闭上又睁开，仿佛他不在这里，也不在那里。他看起来很滑稽，眨着眼睛，试图融入场景，但在情感上，他因暴露在人群中而受到侵犯。他看上去是一位典型的海军军官，很有男子气概，而且尽职尽责。

Birkin came with Hermione. She had a rapt, triumphant look, like the fallen angels restored, yet still subtly demoniacal, now she held Birkin by the arm. And he was expressionless, neutralised, possessed by her as if it were his fate, without question.
伯金和赫敏一起来了。她一脸全神贯注、得意洋洋的样子，就像复活的堕落天使一样，但现在她挽着柏金包的手臂，仍然带着微妙的恶魔般的气息。而他面无表情，中性化，毫无疑问地被她占据，仿佛这就是他的命运。

Gerald Crich came, fair, good-looking, healthy, with a great reserve of energy. He was erect and complete, there was a strange stealth glistening through his amiable, almost happy appearance. Gudrun rose sharply and went away. She could not bear it. She wanted to be alone, to know this strange, sharp inoculation that had changed the whole temper of her blood.
杰拉尔德·克里奇来了，皮肤白皙、英俊、健康，而且精力充沛。他挺拔而完整，他和蔼可亲、近乎幸福的外表闪烁着一种奇怪的神秘感。古德伦猛地起身走开。她无法忍受。她想一个人呆着，想了解这种奇怪而尖锐的接种，它改变了她整个血液的脾气。

CHAPTER II
第二章

SHORTLANDS
肖特兰

The Brangwens went home to Beldover, the wedding-party gathered at Shortlands, the Criches’ home. It was a long, low old house, a sort of manor farm, that spread along the top of a slope just beyond the narrow little lake of Willey Water. Shortlands looked across a sloping meadow that might be a park, because of the large, solitary trees that stood here and there, across the water of the narrow lake, at the wooded hill that successfully hid the colliery valley beyond, but did not quite hide the rising smoke. Nevertheless, the scene was rural and picturesque, very peaceful, and the house had a charm of its own.
布兰文一家回到贝尔多弗的家，婚礼派对聚集在克里奇夫妇的家肖特兰兹。那是一座又长又低的老房子，有点像庄园农场，沿着斜坡的顶部延伸，就在威利沃特狭窄的小湖之外。肖特兰兹的目光穿过一片倾斜的草地，那里可能是一个公园，因为这里那里到处都是高大而孤独的树木，穿过狭窄的湖水，树木繁茂的小山成功地隐藏了远处的煤矿山谷，但并没有完全隐藏升起的烟雾。不过，这里的景色却是田园风光，非常宁静，房子也有它自己的魅力。

It was crowded now with the family and the wedding guests. The father, who was not well, withdrew to rest. Gerald was host. He stood in the homely entrance hall, friendly and easy, attending to the men. He seemed to take pleasure in his social functions, he smiled, and was abundant in hospitality.
现在这里挤满了家人和参加婚礼的宾客。父亲身体不太好，就回去休息了。杰拉德是主持人。他站在朴素的门厅里，友善而从容，照顾着男人们。他似乎很享受自己的社交活动，他面带微笑，而且热情好客。

The women wandered about in a little confusion, chased hither and thither by the three married daughters of the house. All the while there could be heard the characteristic, imperious voice of one Crich woman or another calling ‘Helen, come here a minute,’ ‘Marjory, I want you—here.’ ‘Oh, I say, Mrs Witham—.’ There was a great rustling of skirts, swift glimpses of smartly-dressed women, a child danced through the hall and back again, a maidservant came and went hurriedly.
女人们在家里三个已出嫁的女儿的追赶下，有些混乱地四处游荡。一直以来，都能听到一个或另一个克里奇女人特有的、专横的声音，喊着“海伦，过来一下”，“马乔丽，我要你——在这里。”“哦，我说，威瑟姆太太——”裙子窸窸窣窣地响动，衣着光鲜的妇女们飞快地瞥见，一个孩子在大厅里跳着舞又回来，一个女仆来来去去匆匆。

Meanwhile the men stood in calm little groups, chatting, smoking, pretending to pay no heed to the rustling animation of the women’s world. But they could not really talk, because of the glassy ravel of women’s excited, cold laughter and running voices. They waited, uneasy, suspended, rather bored. But Gerald remained as if genial and happy, unaware that he was waiting or unoccupied, knowing himself the very pivot of the occasion.
与此同时，男人们平静地三五成群地站着，聊天，抽烟，假装对女人世界的喧闹声毫不在意。但他们无法真正交谈，因为女人兴奋、冷酷的笑声和奔跑的声音模糊不清。他们等待着，不安，悬念，相当无聊。但杰拉尔德仍然表现得和蔼可亲、高兴不已，没有意识到自己在等待或闲着，他知道自己是这个场合的关键。

Suddenly Mrs Crich came noiselessly into the room, peering about with her strong, clear face. She was still wearing her hat, and her sac coat of blue silk.
突然，克里奇太太悄无声息地走进房间，用她那张坚强而清晰的脸四处张望。她还戴着帽子，穿着蓝色丝绸外套。

‘What is it, mother?’ said Gerald.
“什么事，妈妈？”杰拉德问道。

‘Nothing, nothing!’ she answered vaguely. And she went straight towards Birkin, who was talking to a Crich brother-in-law.
“没什么，没什么！”她含糊地回答。她径直走向伯金，伯金正在和克里奇的妹夫谈话。

‘How do you do, Mr Birkin,’ she said, in her low voice, that seemed to take no count of her guests. She held out her hand to him.
“你好，伯金先生，”她低声说道，似乎根本不考虑她的客人。她向他伸出了手。

‘Oh Mrs Crich,’ replied Birkin, in his readily-changing voice, ‘I couldn’t come to you before.’
“噢，克里奇夫人，”伯金用随时变化的声音回答道，“我以前没能来找您。”

‘I don’t know half the people here,’ she said, in her low voice. Her son-in-law moved uneasily away.
“这里的人我都不认识，”她低声说道。她的女婿不安地走开了。

‘And you don’t like strangers?’ laughed Birkin. ‘I myself can never see why one should take account of people, just because they happen to be in the room with one: why SHOULD I know they are there?’
“你不喜欢陌生人吗？”伯金笑道。 “我自己永远不明白为什么一个人应该考虑别人，仅仅因为他们碰巧和一个人在一个房间里：为什么我应该知道他们在那里？”

‘Why indeed, why indeed!’ said Mrs Crich, in her low, tense voice. ‘Except that they ARE there. I don’t know people whom I find in the house. The children introduce them to me—‘Mother, this is Mr So-and-so.’ I am no further. What has Mr So-and-so to do with his own name?—and what have I to do with either him or his name?’
“确实是这样，确实是这样！”克里奇夫人用她低沉而紧张的声音说道。 ‘只不过他们就在那里。我不认识在房子里找到的人。孩子们向我介绍他们——“妈妈，这是某某先生。”我不再进一步。某某先生与他自己的名字有什么关系？——而我又与他或他的名字有什么关系呢？

She looked up at Birkin. She startled him. He was flattered too that she came to talk to him, for she took hardly any notice of anybody. He looked down at her tense clear face, with its heavy features, but he was afraid to look into her heavy-seeing blue eyes. He noticed instead how her hair looped in slack, slovenly strands over her rather beautiful ears, which were not quite clean. Neither was her neck perfectly clean. Even in that he seemed to belong to her, rather than to the rest of the company; though, he thought to himself, he was always well washed, at any rate at the neck and ears.
她抬头看着伯金。她吓了他一跳。她来跟他说话也让他受宠若惊，因为她几乎没有注意到任何人。他低头看着她那张紧张而清晰的脸，五官沉重，但他不敢看她那双深邃的蓝眼睛。相反，他注意到她的头发松松垮垮地盘在她漂亮的耳朵上，但耳朵不太干净。她的脖子也不是完全干净。即使他似乎属于她，而不是公司的其他人。不过，他心里想，他总是洗得很干净，至少是脖子和耳朵。

He smiled faintly, thinking these things. Yet he was tense, feeling that he and the elderly, estranged woman were conferring together like traitors, like enemies within the camp of the other people. He resembled a deer, that throws one ear back upon the trail behind, and one ear forward, to know what is ahead.
他淡淡一笑，想着这些。但他还是很紧张，觉得自己和那位疏远的老妇人在一起商议，就像叛徒，就像其他人阵营中的敌人。他就像一只鹿，一只耳朵向后贴在后面的小路上，另一只耳朵向前，以了解前面的情况。

‘People don’t really matter,’ he said, rather unwilling to continue.
“人并不重要，”他说道，但并不愿意继续说下去。

The mother looked up at him with sudden, dark interrogation, as if doubting his sincerity.
母亲突然抬起头，眼神阴沉地询问着，仿佛怀疑他的诚意。

‘How do you mean, MATTER?’ she asked sharply.
“你是什么意思，物质？”她尖锐地问道。

‘Not many people are anything at all,’ he answered, forced to go deeper than he wanted to. ‘They jingle and giggle. It would be much better if they were just wiped out. Essentially, they don’t exist, they aren’t there.’
“没有多少人根本什么都不是，”他回答道，被迫比他想要的更深入。 “他们叮当作响，咯咯地笑。如果直接将他们消灭掉就好了。从本质上讲，它们不存在，不存在。”

She watched him steadily while he spoke.
他说话的时候，她一直注视着他。

‘But we didn’t imagine them,’ she said sharply.
“但我们没有想象到它们，”她尖锐地说。

‘There’s nothing to imagine, that’s why they don’t exist.’
“没有什么可以想象的，这就是它们不存在的原因。”

‘Well,’ she said, ‘I would hardly go as far as that. There they are, whether they exist or no. It doesn’t rest with me to decide on their existence. I only know that I can’t be expected to take count of them all. You can’t expect me to know them, just because they happen to be there. As far as I go they might as well not be there.’
“好吧，”她说，“我几乎不会走那么远。”它们就在那里，无论它们存在与否。它们的存在不由我来决定。我只知道我不能指望把它们全部数完。你不能指望我认识他们，仅仅因为他们碰巧在那里。就我而言，他们可能不在那里。

‘Exactly,’ he replied.
“完全正确，”他回答道。

‘Mightn’t they?’ she asked again.
“难道不是吗？”她又问。

‘Just as well,’ he repeated. And there was a little pause.
“那也好，”他重复道。然后有一点停顿。

‘Except that they ARE there, and that’s a nuisance,’ she said. ‘There are my sons-in-law,’ she went on, in a sort of monologue. ‘Now Laura’s got married, there’s another. And I really don’t know John from James yet. They come up to me and call me mother. I know what they will say—‘how are you, mother?’ I ought to say, ‘I am not your mother, in any sense.’ But what is the use? There they are. I have had children of my own. I suppose I know them from another woman’s children.’
“除非他们在那里，这很麻烦，”她说。 “那是我的女婿，”她以一种独白的方式继续说道。 “现在劳拉已经结婚了，还有另一个。”我真的还不知道约翰和詹姆斯。他们走过来叫我妈妈。我知道他们会说什么——“你好吗，妈妈？”我应该说：“无论如何，我都不是你的妈妈。”但是有什么用呢？他们就在那里。我已经有了自己的孩子。我想我是从另一个女人的孩子那里认识他们的。

‘One would suppose so,’ he said.
“人们会这么认为，”他说。

She looked at him, somewhat surprised, forgetting perhaps that she was talking to him. And she lost her thread.
她有些惊讶地看着他，也许忘记了自己正在和他说话。她失去了线索。

She looked round the room, vaguely. Birkin could not guess what she was looking for, nor what she was thinking. Evidently she noticed her sons.
她茫然地环顾房间。伯金无法猜测她在寻找什么，也无法猜测她在想什么。显然她注意到了她的儿子们。

‘Are my children all there?’ she asked him abruptly.
“我的孩子们都在吗？”她突然问他。

He laughed, startled, afraid perhaps.
他笑了，带着惊讶，也许是害怕。

‘I scarcely know them, except Gerald,’ he replied.
“除了杰拉尔德，我几乎不认识他们，”他回答道。

‘Gerald!’ she exclaimed. ‘He’s the most wanting of them all. You’d never think it, to look at him now, would you?’
“杰拉尔德！”她喊道。 ‘他是他们当中最想要的一个。你绝对不会想到现在会看到他，不是吗？

‘No,’ said Birkin.
“不，”伯金说。

The mother looked across at her eldest son, stared at him heavily for some time.
母亲看了看大儿子，目光沉重地看了他一会儿。

‘Ay,’ she said, in an incomprehensible monosyllable, that sounded profoundly cynical. Birkin felt afraid, as if he dared not realise. And Mrs Crich moved away, forgetting him. But she returned on her traces.
“哎呀，”她用难以理解的单音节说道，听起来非常愤世嫉俗。伯金感到害怕，好像不敢意识到。克里奇夫人走开了，忘记了他。但她还是循着踪迹回来了。

‘I should like him to have a friend,’ she said. ‘He has never had a friend.’
“我希望他有一个朋友，”她说。 “他从来没有朋友。”

Birkin looked down into her eyes, which were blue, and watching heavily. He could not understand them. ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ he said to himself, almost flippantly.
伯金低头看着她的蓝色眼睛，目光凝重。他无法理解他们。 “我是我兄弟的守护者吗？”他几乎是轻率地自言自语。

Then he remembered, with a slight shock, that that was Cain’s cry. And Gerald was Cain, if anybody. Not that he was Cain, either, although he had slain his brother. There was such a thing as pure accident, and the consequences did not attach to one, even though one had killed one’s brother in such wise. Gerald as a boy had accidentally killed his brother. What then? Why seek to draw a brand and a curse across the life that had caused the accident? A man can live by accident, and die by accident. Or can he not? Is every man’s life subject to pure accident, is it only the race, the genus, the species, that has a universal reference? Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident? Has EVERYTHING that happens a universal significance? Has it? Birkin, pondering as he stood there, had forgotten Mrs Crich, as she had forgotten him.
然后他微微震惊地想起那是该隐的叫声。如果有的话，杰拉尔德就是该隐。尽管他杀了他的兄弟，但他也不是该隐。存在这样一种纯粹的意外事件，即使一个人以这种方式杀死了自己的兄弟，也不会产生任何后果。杰拉尔德小时候不小心杀死了他的兄弟。然后怎样呢？为什么要在造成事故的一生中留下烙印和诅咒呢？一个人可以因意外而生，也可以因意外而死。或者他不能？每个人的生命都是纯粹的偶然吗？只有种族、属、种才具有普遍的参考意义吗？或者这不是真的，难道不存在纯粹的意外吗？发生的一切都具有普遍意义吗？有吗？伯金站在那里沉思，他忘记了克里奇夫人，就像她忘记了他一样。

He did not believe that there was any such thing as accident. It all hung together, in the deepest sense.
他不相信有什么意外之类的事情。从最深的意义上来说，这一切都是紧密相连的。

Just as he had decided this, one of the Crich daughters came up, saying:
正当他做出这样的决定时，克里奇的一个女儿走了过来，说道：

‘Won’t you come and take your hat off, mother dear? We shall be sitting down to eat in a minute, and it’s a formal occasion, darling, isn’t it?’ She drew her arm through her mother’s, and they went away. Birkin immediately went to talk to the nearest man.
“亲爱的妈妈，你不来把帽子摘下来吗？我们马上就要坐下来吃饭了，这是一个正式的场合，亲爱的，不是吗？”她挽着母亲的手臂，然后他们就走了。伯金立即去与最近的人交谈。

The gong sounded for the luncheon. The men looked up, but no move was made to the dining-room. The women of the house seemed not to feel that the sound had meaning for them. Five minutes passed by. The elderly manservant, Crowther, appeared in the doorway exasperatedly. He looked with appeal at Gerald. The latter took up a large, curved conch shell, that lay on a shelf, and without reference to anybody, blew a shattering blast. It was a strange rousing noise, that made the heart beat. The summons was almost magical. Everybody came running, as if at a signal. And then the crowd in one impulse moved to the dining-room.
午餐的锣声响起。男人们抬起头来，但没有朝餐厅走去。家里的女人们似乎并不觉得这个声音对她们有任何意义。五分钟过去了。年长的男仆克劳瑟愤怒地出现在门口。他用恳求的目光看着杰拉德。后者拿起放在架子上的一个巨大的、弯曲的海螺壳，不顾任何人，吹出了粉碎性的爆炸声。这是一种奇怪的、令人兴奋的声音，让人心跳不已。召唤几乎是神奇的。每个人都跑过来，就像接到信号一样。然后人群一时冲动涌向餐厅。

Gerald waited a moment, for his sister to play hostess. He knew his mother would pay no attention to her duties. But his sister merely crowded to her seat. Therefore the young man, slightly too dictatorial, directed the guests to their places.
杰拉德等了一会儿，等他妹妹来担任女主人。他知道他的母亲不会注意她的职责。但他的妹妹只是挤到座位上。于是，这位略显专横的年轻人便指挥客人就座。

There was a moment’s lull, as everybody looked at the BORS D’OEUVRES that were being handed round. And out of this lull, a girl of thirteen or fourteen, with her long hair down her back, said in a calm, self-possessed voice:
片刻的平静，每个人都看着正在分发的 BORS D’OEUVRES。就在这片寂静中，一个十三、十四岁、长发披在脑后的女孩，用平静、沉着的声音说道：

‘Gerald, you forget father, when you make that unearthly noise.’
“杰拉尔德，当你发出那种怪异的声音时，你忘记了父亲。”

‘Do I?’ he answered. And then, to the company, ‘Father is lying down, he is not quite well.’
“我愿意吗？”他回答道。然后，对大家说：“父亲躺着，他不太舒服。”

‘How is he, really?’ called one of the married daughters, peeping round the immense wedding cake that towered up in the middle of the table shedding its artificial flowers.
“他真的好吗？”一位已婚的女儿问道，她环视着桌子中央高耸的巨大婚礼蛋糕，上面的人造花都脱落了。

‘He has no pain, but he feels tired,’ replied Winifred, the girl with the hair down her back.
“他没有疼痛，但他感到疲倦，”头发垂到脑后的女孩温妮弗雷德回答道。

The wine was filled, and everybody was talking boisterously. At the far end of the table sat the mother, with her loosely-looped hair. She had Birkin for a neighbour. Sometimes she glanced fiercely down the rows of faces, bending forwards and staring unceremoniously. And she would say in a low voice to Birkin:
酒已满，众人七嘴八舌地议论着。母亲坐在桌子的另一端，头发松散地盘成一圈。她的邻居有柏金包。有时她会猛烈地扫视一排排的面孔，向前弯腰，毫不客气地凝视着。她会低声对 Birkin 说：

‘Who is that young man?’
“那个年轻人是谁？”

‘I don’t know,’ Birkin answered discreetly.
“我不知道，”伯金谨慎地回答。

‘Have I seen him before?’ she asked.
“我以前见过他吗？”她问道。

‘I don’t think so. I haven’t,’ he replied. And she was satisfied. Her eyes closed wearily, a peace came over her face, she looked like a queen in repose. Then she started, a little social smile came on her face, for a moment she looked the pleasant hostess. For a moment she bent graciously, as if everyone were welcome and delightful. And then immediately the shadow came back, a sullen, eagle look was on her face, she glanced from under her brows like a sinister creature at bay, hating them all.
'我不这么认为。我没有，”他回答道。她很满意。她疲倦地闭上眼睛，脸上浮现出平静，看起来就像一位安息的女王。然后她开始了，脸上露出了一点社交微笑，一时间她看起来像个令人愉快的女主人。有那么一会儿，她优雅地弯下腰，仿佛每个人都受到欢迎和愉快。然后黑影立刻回来了，她的脸上露出阴沉的鹰般的表情，她从眉毛下扫视着，就像一个陷入困境的邪恶生物，憎恨他们所有人。

‘Mother,’ called Diana, a handsome girl a little older than Winifred, ‘I may have wine, mayn’t I?’
“妈妈，”比威妮弗雷德大一点的英俊女孩戴安娜喊道，“我可以喝点酒，可以吗？”

‘Yes, you may have wine,’ replied the mother automatically, for she was perfectly indifferent to the question.
“是的，你可以喝点酒。”母亲自然地回答道，因为她对这个问题完全漠不关心。

And Diana beckoned to the footman to fill her glass.
戴安娜示意男仆给她倒杯酒。

‘Gerald shouldn’t forbid me,’ she said calmly, to the company at large.
“杰拉尔德不应该禁止我，”她平静地对整个公司说道。

‘All right, Di,’ said her brother amiably. And she glanced challenge at him as she drank from her glass.
“好吧，迪，”她哥哥和蔼可亲地说。她一边喝着杯子里的酒，一边挑衅地看了他一眼。

There was a strange freedom, that almost amounted to anarchy, in the house. It was rather a resistance to authority, than liberty. Gerald had some command, by mere force of personality, not because of any granted position. There was a quality in his voice, amiable but dominant, that cowed the others, who were all younger than he.
房子里有一种奇怪的自由，几乎等于无政府状态。这与其说是对自由的反抗，不如说是对权威的反抗。杰拉德拥有一定的指挥权，这纯粹是因为他的人格力量，而不是因为任何授予的职位。他的声音里有一种气质，和蔼可亲，却又极具统治力，让其他比他年轻的人都感到害怕。

Hermione was having a discussion with the bridegroom about nationality.
赫敏正在和新郎讨论国籍问题。

‘No,’ she said, ‘I think that the appeal to patriotism is a mistake. It is like one house of business rivalling another house of business.’
“不，”她说，“我认为诉诸爱国主义是一个错误。这就像一家企业与另一家企业竞争。”

‘Well you can hardly say that, can you?’ exclaimed Gerald, who had a real PASSION for discussion. ‘You couldn’t call a race a business concern, could you?—and nationality roughly corresponds to race, I think. I think it is MEANT to.’
“好吧，你很难这么说，不是吗？”杰拉尔德大声说道，他非常热衷于讨论。 “你不能把种族称为商业问题，对吗？——我认为，国籍大致对应于种族。我认为这是有意的。

There was a moment’s pause. Gerald and Hermione were always strangely but politely and evenly inimical.
停顿了一会儿。杰拉尔德和赫敏的态度总是奇怪但又礼貌，甚至充满敌意。

‘DO you think race corresponds with nationality?’ she asked musingly, with expressionless indecision.
“你认为种族与国籍相符吗？”她若有所思地问道，面无表情，犹豫不决。

Birkin knew she was waiting for him to participate. And dutifully he spoke up.
伯金知道她在等他参加。他尽职尽责地开口说道。

‘I think Gerald is right—race is the essential element in nationality, in Europe at least,’ he said.
“我认为杰拉德是对的——种族是国籍的基本要素，至少在欧洲是这样，”他说。

Again Hermione paused, as if to allow this statement to cool. Then she said with strange assumption of authority:
赫敏再次停了下来，仿佛是为了让这句话冷静下来。然后她带着奇怪的权威说道：

‘Yes, but even so, is the patriotic appeal an appeal to the racial instinct? Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the COMMERCIAL instinct? And isn’t this what we mean by nationality?’
是的，但即便如此，爱国诉求是否是对种族本能的诉求？这难道不是对所有权本能、商业本能的诉求吗？这不就是我们所说的国籍吗？

‘Probably,’ said Birkin, who felt that such a discussion was out of place and out of time.
“可能吧，”伯金说，他觉得这样的讨论不合时宜。

But Gerald was now on the scent of argument.
但杰拉德现在已经开始争论了。

‘A race may have its commercial aspect,’ he said. ‘In fact it must. It is like a family. You MUST make provision. And to make provision you have got to strive against other families, other nations. I don’t see why you shouldn’t.’
“一场比赛可能有其商业方面，”他说。 ‘事实上必须如此。它就像一个家庭。你必须做好准备。为了提供给养，你必须与其他家庭、其他国家进行斗争。我不明白为什么你不应该这样做。

Again Hermione made a pause, domineering and cold, before she replied: ‘Yes, I think it is always wrong to provoke a spirit of rivalry. It makes bad blood. And bad blood accumulates.’
赫敏再次停顿了一下，专横而冷酷，然后回答道：“是的，我认为挑起竞争精神总是错误的。它会让人坏血。坏血液会不断积累。

‘But you can’t do away with the spirit of emulation altogether?’ said Gerald. ‘It is one of the necessary incentives to production and improvement.’
“但是你不能完全消除竞争精神吗？”杰拉尔德说。 “这是生产和改进的必要激励之一。”

‘Yes,’ came Hermione’s sauntering response. ‘I think you can do away with it.’
“是的，”赫敏慢悠悠地回答。 “我认为你可以取消它。”

‘I must say,’ said Birkin, ‘I detest the spirit of emulation.’ Hermione was biting a piece of bread, pulling it from between her teeth with her fingers, in a slow, slightly derisive movement. She turned to Birkin.
“我必须说，”伯金说，“我讨厌竞争精神。”赫敏正在咬一块面包，用手指把它从牙缝里拉出来，动作缓慢，略带嘲讽。她转向伯金。

‘You do hate it, yes,’ she said, intimate and gratified.
“是的，你确实讨厌它，”她亲密而满足地说道。

‘Detest it,’ he repeated.
“讨厌它，”他重复道。

‘Yes,’ she murmured, assured and satisfied.
“是的，”她低声说道，充满信心和满足。

‘But,’ Gerald insisted, ‘you don’t allow one man to take away his neighbour’s living, so why should you allow one nation to take away the living from another nation?’
“但是，”杰拉尔德坚持说，“你不允许一个人夺走他邻居的生计，那你为什么要允许一个国家夺走另一个国家的生计呢？”

There was a long slow murmur from Hermione before she broke into speech, saying with a laconic indifference:
赫敏缓慢地低声说了一声长长的低语，然后突然开口说话，语气简洁、冷漠地说：

‘It is not always a question of possessions, is it? It is not all a question of goods?’
“这并不总是财产问题，不是吗？这不全是货物的问题吗？

Gerald was nettled by this implication of vulgar materialism.
杰拉尔德对这种粗俗唯物主义的暗示感到恼火。

‘Yes, more or less,’ he retorted. ‘If I go and take a man’s hat from off his head, that hat becomes a symbol of that man’s liberty. When he fights me for his hat, he is fighting me for his liberty.’
“是的，或多或少，”他反驳道。 “如果我去把一个人头上的帽子摘下来，那顶帽子就成为那个人自由的象征。当他与我争夺他的帽子时，他是在与我争夺他的自由。

Hermione was nonplussed.
赫敏一头雾水。

‘Yes,’ she said, irritated. ‘But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine, is it? A man does NOT come and take my hat from off my head, does he?’
“是的，”她生气地说。 “但是这种通过想象的例子进行论证的方式不应该是真实的，不是吗？一个人不会来把我头上的帽子拿下来，不是吗？

‘Only because the law prevents him,’ said Gerald.
“只是因为法律禁止他这么做，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Not only,’ said Birkin. ‘Ninety-nine men out of a hundred don’t want my hat.’
“不仅如此，”伯金说。 “一百个人中有九十九个人不想要我的帽子。”

‘That’s a matter of opinion,’ said Gerald.
“这是一个观点问题，”杰拉德说。

‘Or the hat,’ laughed the bridegroom.
“或者帽子，”新郎笑道。

‘And if he does want my hat, such as it is,’ said Birkin, ‘why, surely it is open to me to decide, which is a greater loss to me, my hat, or my liberty as a free and indifferent man. If I am compelled to offer fight, I lose the latter. It is a question which is worth more to me, my pleasant liberty of conduct, or my hat.’
“如果他确实想要我的帽子，就像它一样，”伯金说，“为什么，这当然由我来决定，这对我、我的帽子或我作为一个自由而冷漠的人的自由来说是更大的损失。如果我被迫提出战斗，我就会输掉后者。这个问题对我来说更有价值，无论是我愉快的行为自由还是我的帽子。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, watching Birkin strangely. ‘Yes.’
“是的，”赫敏奇怪地看着伯金说道。 '是的。'

‘But would you let somebody come and snatch your hat off your head?’ the bride asked of Hermione.
“但是你会让有人来把你头上的帽子抢走吗？”新娘问赫敏。

The face of the tall straight woman turned slowly and as if drugged to this new speaker.
高挑挺拔的女人的脸慢慢转动，仿佛对这个新说话者下了药。

‘No,’ she replied, in a low inhuman tone, that seemed to contain a chuckle. ‘No, I shouldn’t let anybody take my hat off my head.’
“不，”她回答道，语气低沉，不近人情，似乎还带着一丝笑意。 “不，我不应该让任何人把我的帽子从我头上摘下来。”

‘How would you prevent it?’ asked Gerald.
“你会怎样阻止它呢？”杰拉尔德问。

‘I don’t know,’ replied Hermione slowly. ‘Probably I should kill him.’
“我不知道，”赫敏缓慢地回答。 “也许我应该杀了他。”

There was a strange chuckle in her tone, a dangerous and convincing humour in her bearing.
她的语气里有一种奇怪的笑意，她的举止中有一种危险而令人信服的幽默。

‘Of course,’ said Gerald, ‘I can see Rupert’s point. It is a question to him whether his hat or his peace of mind is more important.’
“当然，”杰拉尔德说，“我明白鲁珀特的观点。对他来说，问题是他的帽子和内心的平静哪个更重要。

‘Peace of body,’ said Birkin.
“身体安宁，”伯金说。

‘Well, as you like there,’ replied Gerald. ‘But how are you going to decide this for a nation?’
“好吧，随你便。”杰拉德回答道。 “但是你要如何为一个国家做出这个决定呢？”

‘Heaven preserve me,’ laughed Birkin.
“愿上帝保佑我，”伯金笑着说。

‘Yes, but suppose you have to?’ Gerald persisted.
“是的，但如果你必须这样做呢？”杰拉德坚持道。

‘Then it is the same. If the national crown-piece is an old hat, then the thieving gent may have it.’
‘那就一样了。如果国家皇冠是一顶旧帽子，那么小偷可能会拥有它。

‘But CAN the national or racial hat be an old hat?’ insisted Gerald.
“但是民族或种族帽子可以是旧帽子吗？”杰拉尔德坚持说。

‘Pretty well bound to be, I believe,’ said Birkin.
“我相信这是必然的，”伯金说。

‘I’m not so sure,’ said Gerald.
“我不太确定，”杰拉尔德说。

‘I don’t agree, Rupert,’ said Hermione.
“我不同意，鲁珀特，”赫敏说。

‘All right,’ said Birkin.
“好吧，”伯金说。

‘I’m all for the old national hat,’ laughed Gerald.
“我完全赞成旧的国家帽子，”杰拉德笑着说。

‘And a fool you look in it,’ cried Diana, his pert sister who was just in her teens.
“你看它的样子真是个傻瓜，”戴安娜叫道，她是他十几岁的活泼妹妹。

‘Oh, we’re quite out of our depths with these old hats,’ cried Laura Crich. ‘Dry up now, Gerald. We’re going to drink toasts. Let us drink toasts. Toasts—glasses, glasses—now then, toasts! Speech! Speech!’
“哦，我们对这些旧帽子已经完全不知所措了，”劳拉·克里奇喊道。 “现在擦干吧，杰拉德。我们要喝干杯。让我们干杯吧。干杯——眼镜，眼镜——现在，干杯！演讲！演讲！'

Birkin, thinking about race or national death, watched his glass being filled with champagne. The bubbles broke at the rim, the man withdrew, and feeling a sudden thirst at the sight of the fresh wine, Birkin drank up his glass. A queer little tension in the room roused him. He felt a sharp constraint.
伯金一边思考着种族或国家的灭亡，一边看着他的杯子里装满了香槟。气泡在边缘破裂，男人退了出去，看到新鲜的酒，伯金突然感到口渴，把杯子喝了下去。房间里一股奇怪的紧张气氛唤醒了他。他感到一种强烈的束缚。

‘Did I do it by accident, or on purpose?’ he asked himself. And he decided that, according to the vulgar phrase, he had done it ‘accidentally on purpose.’ He looked round at the hired footman. And the hired footman came, with a silent step of cold servant-like disapprobation. Birkin decided that he detested toasts, and footmen, and assemblies, and mankind altogether, in most of its aspects. Then he rose to make a speech. But he was somehow disgusted.
“我是偶然这样做的，还是故意的？”他问自己。他断定，按照俗话说，他是“故意无意中做的”。他环顾了一下雇佣的男仆。雇来的男仆走了过来，他的脚步像冷漠的仆人一样，一言不发，表示不赞成。伯金认为，他厌恶敬酒、男仆、集会和人类的大部分方面。然后他起身发表讲话。但他却有些厌恶。

At length it was over, the meal. Several men strolled out into the garden. There was a lawn, and flower-beds, and at the boundary an iron fence shutting off the little field or park. The view was pleasant; a highroad curving round the edge of a low lake, under the trees. In the spring air, the water gleamed and the opposite woods were purplish with new life. Charming Jersey cattle came to the fence, breathing hoarsely from their velvet muzzles at the human beings, expecting perhaps a crust.
终于，这顿饭结束了。几个男人漫步到花园里。那里有一片草坪和花坛，边界上有一道铁栅栏将小田野或公园隔开。景色宜人；一条公路，蜿蜒绕着一个低矮的湖边，位于树下。春天的空气中，水面闪闪发光，对面的树林呈现出新的紫色。迷人的泽西牛来到栅栏边，用天鹅绒的口鼻对人类发出嘶哑的呼吸，期待着可能有硬皮的到来。

Birkin leaned on the fence. A cow was breathing wet hotness on his hand.
伯金靠在栅栏上。一头牛在他的手上呼吸着潮湿的热气。

‘Pretty cattle, very pretty,’ said Marshall, one of the brothers-in-law. ‘They give the best milk you can have.’
“非常牛，非常漂亮，”其中一位妹夫马歇尔说。 “他们提供最好的牛奶。”

‘Yes,’ said Birkin.
“是的，”伯金说。

‘Eh, my little beauty, eh, my beauty!’ said Marshall, in a queer high falsetto voice, that caused the other man to have convulsions of laughter in his stomach.
“呃，我的小美人，呃，我的美人！”马歇尔用一种奇怪的高假声说，这让另一个人笑得肚子抽搐。

‘Who won the race, Lupton?’ he called to the bridegroom, to hide the fact that he was laughing.
“谁赢得了比赛，拉普顿？”他对新郎喊道，以掩饰自己在笑的事实。

The bridegroom took his cigar from his mouth.
新郎从嘴里拿走了雪茄。

‘The race?’ he exclaimed. Then a rather thin smile came over his face. He did not want to say anything about the flight to the church door. ‘We got there together. At least she touched first, but I had my hand on her shoulder.’
“比赛？”他喊道。然后他的脸上浮现出一丝淡淡的微笑。他不想再说关于飞到教堂门口的事情。 ‘我们一起到达那里。至少是她先触碰的，但我的手放在了她的肩膀上。”

‘What’s this?’ asked Gerald.
“这是什么？”杰拉尔德问。

Birkin told him about the race of the bride and the bridegroom.
伯金向他讲述了新娘和新郎的种族。

‘H’m!’ said Gerald, in disapproval. ‘What made you late then?’
“嗯！”杰拉德不以为然地说。 “那你怎么迟到了？”

‘Lupton would talk about the immortality of the soul,’ said Birkin, ‘and then he hadn’t got a button-hook.’
“拉普顿会谈论灵魂的不朽，”伯金说，“然后他就没有纽扣钩了。”

‘Oh God!’ cried Marshall. ‘The immortality of the soul on your wedding day! Hadn’t you got anything better to occupy your mind?’
“天哪！”马歇尔喊道。 ‘婚礼当天灵魂不朽！难道你就没有什么更好的事可以占据你的心思吗？

‘What’s wrong with it?’ asked the bridegroom, a clean-shaven naval man, flushing sensitively.
“怎么了？”新郎问道，他是一位胡子刮得干干净净的海军军人，脸涨得通红。

‘Sounds as if you were going to be executed instead of married. THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL!’ repeated the brother-in-law, with most killing emphasis.
“听起来你不是要结婚，而是要被处决。”灵魂不朽！”姐夫重复道，语气极其凶狠。

But he fell quite flat.
但他的表现却很平淡。

‘And what did you decide?’ asked Gerald, at once pricking up his ears at the thought of a metaphysical discussion.
“那你决定怎么办？”杰拉德问道，一想到要进行形而上学的讨论，他立刻竖起了耳朵。

‘You don’t want a soul today, my boy,’ said Marshall. ‘It’d be in your road.’
“今天你不需要一个灵魂，我的孩子，”马歇尔说。 “它会在你的路上。”

‘Christ! Marshall, go and talk to somebody else,’ cried Gerald, with sudden impatience.
'基督！马歇尔，去和别人谈谈吧。”杰拉德突然不耐烦地喊道。

‘By God, I’m willing,’ said Marshall, in a temper. ‘Too much bloody soul and talk altogether—‘
“上帝作证，我愿意。”马歇尔怒气冲冲地说。 “太多该死的灵魂和谈话——”

He withdrew in a dudgeon, Gerald staring after him with angry eyes, that grew gradually calm and amiable as the stoutly-built form of the other man passed into the distance.
他怒气冲冲地退了出去，杰拉尔德用愤怒的眼神盯着他，随着另一个人健壮的身影消失在远处，他的眼神逐渐变得平静和和蔼可亲。

‘There’s one thing, Lupton,’ said Gerald, turning suddenly to the bridegroom. ‘Laura won’t have brought such a fool into the family as Lottie did.’
“有一件事，拉普顿，”杰拉德突然转向新郎说道。 “劳拉不会像洛蒂那样把这样的傻瓜带进家里。”

‘Comfort yourself with that,’ laughed Birkin.
“用这个来安慰自己吧，”伯金笑着说。

‘I take no notice of them,’ laughed the bridegroom.
“我没注意到他们，”新郎笑道。

‘What about this race then—who began it?’ Gerald asked.
“那么这场比赛呢？是谁发起的？”杰拉德问道。

‘We were late. Laura was at the top of the churchyard steps when our cab came up. She saw Lupton bolting towards her. And she fled. But why do you look so cross? Does it hurt your sense of the family dignity?’
'我们迟了。当我们的出租车开过来时，劳拉正在墓地台阶的顶端。她看到拉普顿冲向她。她逃跑了。但你为什么看起来这么生气？这会伤害你的家庭尊严感吗？

‘It does, rather,’ said Gerald. ‘If you’re doing a thing, do it properly, and if you’re not going to do it properly, leave it alone.’
“确实如此，”杰拉尔德说。 “如果你正在做一件事，就好好做，如果你不打算好好做，那就别管它。”

‘Very nice aphorism,’ said Birkin.
“非常好的格言，”伯金说。

‘Don’t you agree?’ asked Gerald.
“你不同意吗？”杰拉尔德问。

‘Quite,’ said Birkin. ‘Only it bores me rather, when you become aphoristic.’
“确实如此，”伯金说。 “只是当你变得格言警句时，我才感到厌烦。”

‘Damn you, Rupert, you want all the aphorisms your own way,’ said Gerald.
“该死的，鲁珀特，你想要所有的格言都按照你自己的方式来，”杰拉尔德说。

‘No. I want them out of the way, and you’re always shoving them in it.’
'不。我希望他们让开，而你却总是把他们推进去。”

Gerald smiled grimly at this humorism. Then he made a little gesture of dismissal, with his eyebrows.
杰拉德对这种幽默冷酷地笑了笑。然后他挑起眉毛，做了一个不屑一顾的手势。

‘You don’t believe in having any standard of behaviour at all, do you?’ he challenged Birkin, censoriously.
“你根本不相信有任何行为标准，是吗？”他严厉地质问伯金。

‘Standard—no. I hate standards. But they’re necessary for the common ruck. Anybody who is anything can just be himself and do as he likes.’
‘标准——不。我讨厌标准。但它们对于普通卡车来说是必需的。任何人都可以做他自己，做他喜欢做的事。”

‘But what do you mean by being himself?’ said Gerald. ‘Is that an aphorism or a cliche?’
“但是你所说的做他自己是什么意思呢？”杰​​拉尔德说。 “这是一句格言还是一句陈词滥调？”

‘I mean just doing what you want to do. I think it was perfect good form in Laura to bolt from Lupton to the church door. It was almost a masterpiece in good form. It’s the hardest thing in the world to act spontaneously on one’s impulses—and it’s the only really gentlemanly thing to do—provided you’re fit to do it.’
‘我的意思是只做你想做的事。我认为劳拉从拉普顿冲向教堂大门的举动是完美的。这几乎是一部形式良好的杰作。凭自己的冲动自发行动是世界上最难的事情，也是唯一真正有绅士风度的事情，只要你适合这样做。

‘You don’t expect me to take you seriously, do you?’ asked Gerald.
“你不会指望我会认真对待你吧？”杰拉德问道。

‘Yes, Gerald, you’re one of the very few people I do expect that of.’
“是的，杰拉尔德，你是我所期望的极少数人之一。”

‘Then I’m afraid I can’t come up to your expectations here, at any rate. You think people should just do as they like.’
“那么我恐怕无论如何都达不到你的期望。你认为人们应该做他们喜欢做的事。”

‘I think they always do. But I should like them to like the purely individual thing in themselves, which makes them act in singleness. And they only like to do the collective thing.’
“我想他们总是这样。但我希望他们喜欢自己纯粹的个人事物，这使得他们行动单一。他们只喜欢做集体的事情。

‘And I,’ said Gerald grimly, ‘shouldn’t like to be in a world of people who acted individually and spontaneously, as you call it. We should have everybody cutting everybody else’s throat in five minutes.’
“而我，”杰拉尔德冷酷地说，“不应该喜欢生活在一个人们单独自发行动的世界里，就像你所说的那样。我们应该让每个人在五分钟内割断其他人的喉咙。

‘That means YOU would like to be cutting everybody’s throat,’ said Birkin.
“这意味着你想割断每个人的喉咙，”伯金说。

‘How does that follow?’ asked Gerald crossly.
“那是怎么回事？”杰拉德生气地问。

‘No man,’ said Birkin, ‘cuts another man’s throat unless he wants to cut it, and unless the other man wants it cutting. This is a complete truth. It takes two people to make a murder: a murderer and a murderee. And a murderee is a man who is murderable. And a man who is murderable is a man who in a profound if hidden lust desires to be murdered.’
伯金说：“没有人会割断另一个人的喉咙，除非他想割断别人的喉咙，除非另一个人想要割断别人的喉咙。”这是完全的事实。谋杀需要两个人：杀人犯和被害人。被谋杀者是一个可被谋杀的人。一个可被谋杀的人是一个在深刻而隐藏的欲望中渴望被谋杀的人。

‘Sometimes you talk pure nonsense,’ said Gerald to Birkin. ‘As a matter of fact, none of us wants our throat cut, and most other people would like to cut it for us—some time or other—‘
杰拉尔德对伯金说：“有时你完全是在胡说八道。” “事实上，我们谁都不想割断自己的喉咙，而大多数其他人都愿意为我们割断喉咙——某个时候或其他——”

‘It’s a nasty view of things, Gerald,’ said Birkin, ‘and no wonder you are afraid of yourself and your own unhappiness.’
“这是一种令人厌恶的看法，杰拉尔德，”伯金说，“难怪你害怕自己和自己的不幸。”

‘How am I afraid of myself?’ said Gerald; ‘and I don’t think I am unhappy.’
“我怎么会害怕自己呢？”杰拉尔德说。 “而且我不认为我不快乐。”

‘You seem to have a lurking desire to have your gizzard slit, and imagine every man has his knife up his sleeve for you,’ Birkin said.
伯金说：“你似乎潜藏着想要割开你的砂囊的欲望，想象一下每个男人都把刀藏在袖子里等着你。”

‘How do you make that out?’ said Gerald.
“你怎么看出来的？”杰拉尔德说。

‘From you,’ said Birkin.
“来自你，”伯金说。

There was a pause of strange enmity between the two men, that was very near to love. It was always the same between them; always their talk brought them into a deadly nearness of contact, a strange, perilous intimacy which was either hate or love, or both. They parted with apparent unconcern, as if their going apart were a trivial occurrence. And they really kept it to the level of trivial occurrence. Yet the heart of each burned from the other. They burned with each other, inwardly. This they would never admit. They intended to keep their relationship a casual free-and-easy friendship, they were not going to be so unmanly and unnatural as to allow any heart-burning between them. They had not the faintest belief in deep relationship between men and men, and their disbelief prevented any development of their powerful but suppressed friendliness.
两个人之间出现了一种奇怪的敌意，非常接近爱情。他们之间总是一样的；他们的谈话总是让他们陷入一种致命的亲密接触，一种奇怪的、危险的亲密关系，要么是恨，要么是爱，或者两者兼而有之。他们的离别显得毫不在意，仿佛他们的分开是一件微不足道的事情。他们确实将其保持在微不足道的水平上。然而彼此的心都被对方灼烧着。他们内心互相燃烧。这是他们永远不会承认的。他们打算让他们的关系保持一种随意洒脱的友谊，他们不会如此没有男子气概和不自然，以至于让他们之间有任何心痛。他们对人与人之间的深厚关系没有丝毫的相信，他们的不相信阻止了他们强大但压抑的友谊的发展。

CHAPTER III
第三章

CLASS-ROOM
课堂

A school-day was drawing to a close. In the class-room the last lesson was in progress, peaceful and still. It was elementary botany. The desks were littered with catkins, hazel and willow, which the children had been sketching. But the sky had come overdark, as the end of the afternoon approached: there was scarcely light to draw any more. Ursula stood in front of the class, leading the children by questions to understand the structure and the meaning of the catkins.
一天的学习即将结束。教室里正在上最后一课，安静而祥和。这是初级植物学。课桌上散落着柳絮、榛树和柳树，孩子们一直在画这些东西。但随着下午快结束时，天空已经变得太暗了：几乎没有光亮了。乌苏拉站在全班前面，用问题带领孩子们了解柳絮的结构和含义。

A heavy, copper-coloured beam of light came in at the west window, gilding the outlines of the children’s heads with red gold, and falling on the wall opposite in a rich, ruddy illumination. Ursula, however, was scarcely conscious of it. She was busy, the end of the day was here, the work went on as a peaceful tide that is at flood, hushed to retire.
一道浓重的古铜色光柱从西窗射入，给孩子们的头颅轮廓镀上一层赤金色，落在对面的墙上，映出浓浓的红光。然而，乌苏拉几乎没有意识到这一点。她很忙，一天的时间到了，工作继续进行，就像平静的潮水涨潮后安静地退去。

This day had gone by like so many more, in an activity that was like a trance. At the end there was a little haste, to finish what was in hand. She was pressing the children with questions, so that they should know all they were to know, by the time the gong went. She stood in shadow in front of the class, with catkins in her hand, and she leaned towards the children, absorbed in the passion of instruction.
这一天就像许多其他日子一样，在一种恍惚的活动中过去了。最后有点匆忙，要完成手头的事情。她向孩子们提出问题，以便他们在锣声响起时知道他们应该知道的一切。她站在全班同学面前的阴影里，手里拿着柳絮，身体靠向孩子们，全神贯注于教学的热情。

She heard, but did not notice the click of the door. Suddenly she started. She saw, in the shaft of ruddy, copper-coloured light near her, the face of a man. It was gleaming like fire, watching her, waiting for her to be aware. It startled her terribly. She thought she was going to faint. All her suppressed, subconscious fear sprang into being, with anguish.
她听到了，但没有注意到门的咔哒声。突然她吃了一惊。她看到，在她附近的红铜色光芒中，有一张男人的脸。它像火一样闪闪发光，注视着她，等待她意识到。这让她大吃一惊。她以为自己要晕倒了。她所有压抑的、潜意识的恐惧都随着痛苦而涌现。

‘Did I startle you?’ said Birkin, shaking hands with her. ‘I thought you had heard me come in.’
“我吓到你了吗？”伯金一边和她握手一边说道。 “我以为你已经听到我进来了。”

‘No,’ she faltered, scarcely able to speak. He laughed, saying he was sorry. She wondered why it amused him.
“不，”她结结巴巴，几乎说不出话来。他笑了笑，表示很抱歉。她想知道为什么这让他觉得好笑。

‘It is so dark,’ he said. ‘Shall we have the light?’
“天太黑了，”他说。 “我们可以点灯吗？”

And moving aside, he switched on the strong electric lights. The class-room was distinct and hard, a strange place after the soft dim magic that filled it before he came. Birkin turned curiously to look at Ursula. Her eyes were round and wondering, bewildered, her mouth quivered slightly. She looked like one who is suddenly wakened. There was a living, tender beauty, like a tender light of dawn shining from her face. He looked at her with a new pleasure, feeling gay in his heart, irresponsible.
他走到一边，打开了强电灯。教室独特而坚硬，在他来之前教室里充满了柔和而昏暗的魔法之后，这是一个奇怪的地方。伯金好奇地转头看着乌苏拉。她的眼睛睁得圆圆的，疑惑、困惑，嘴唇微微颤抖。她看起来就像是一个突然醒来的人。她的脸上闪烁着一种鲜活的、温柔的美，就像黎明的温柔光芒。他用一种新的快感看着她，心里感到快活、不负责任。

‘You are doing catkins?’ he asked, picking up a piece of hazel from a scholar’s desk in front of him. ‘Are they as far out as this? I hadn’t noticed them this year.’
“你在做柳絮吗？”他问道，从面前的学者桌上拿起一块榛子。 ‘他们有这么远吗？今年我没有注意到他们。

He looked absorbedly at the tassel of hazel in his hand.
他全神贯注地看着手中的榛子流苏。

‘The red ones too!’ he said, looking at the flickers of crimson that came from the female bud.
“还有红色的！”他看着雌花蕾闪烁的深红色说道。

Then he went in among the desks, to see the scholars’ books. Ursula watched his intent progress. There was a stillness in his motion that hushed the activities of her heart. She seemed to be standing aside in arrested silence, watching him move in another, concentrated world. His presence was so quiet, almost like a vacancy in the corporate air.
然后他走进课桌，查看学者们的书籍。乌苏拉注视着他的意图进展。他的动作一片寂静，让她的心停止了活动。她似乎站在一旁，沉默不语，看着他在另一个专注的世界里移动。他的存在是如此安静，几乎就像公司空气中的一个空缺。

Suddenly he lifted his face to her, and her heart quickened at the flicker of his voice.
突然，他抬起脸来看着她，他的声音闪烁着，她的心跳加速了。

‘Give them some crayons, won’t you?’ he said, ‘so that they can make the gynaecious flowers red, and the androgynous yellow. I’d chalk them in plain, chalk in nothing else, merely the red and the yellow. Outline scarcely matters in this case. There is just the one fact to emphasise.’
“给他们一些蜡笔，好吗？”他说，“这样他们就能把雌雄同体的花涂成红色，雌雄同体的花涂成黄色。我会用普通的粉笔画出它们，只用粉笔画红色和黄色。在这种情况下，大纲几乎不重要。只有一个事实需要强调。

‘I haven’t any crayons,’ said Ursula.
“我没有蜡笔，”乌苏拉说。

‘There will be some somewhere—red and yellow, that’s all you want.’
“某个地方会有一些——红色和黄色，这就是你想要的。”

Ursula sent out a boy on a quest.
乌苏拉派出一个男孩去执行任务。

‘It will make the books untidy,’ she said to Birkin, flushing deeply.
“这会让书变得不整齐，”她对伯金说，脸涨得通红。

‘Not very,’ he said. ‘You must mark in these things obviously. It’s the fact you want to emphasise, not the subjective impression to record. What’s the fact?—red little spiky stigmas of the female flower, dangling yellow male catkin, yellow pollen flying from one to the other. Make a pictorial record of the fact, as a child does when drawing a face—two eyes, one nose, mouth with teeth—so—‘ And he drew a figure on the blackboard.
“不太好，”他说。 ‘你必须清楚地标记这些事情。你要强调的是事实，而不是要记录的主观印象。事实是什么？——雌花的红色小尖柱头，悬挂着的黄色雄花序，黄色的花粉从一朵飞到另一朵。把这个事实用图画记录下来，就像一个孩子画脸时所做的那样——两只眼睛，一个鼻子，有牙齿的嘴巴——所以——’然后他在黑板上画了一个图形。

At that moment another vision was seen through the glass panels of the door. It was Hermione Roddice. Birkin went and opened to her.
就在这时，透过门的玻璃板看到了另一个景象。这是赫敏·罗迪斯。伯金走过去给她打开。

‘I saw your car,’ she said to him. ‘Do you mind my coming to find you? I wanted to see you when you were on duty.’
“我看到你的车了，”她对他说。 ‘你介意我来找你吗？我想在你值班的时候见到你。

She looked at him for a long time, intimate and playful, then she gave a short little laugh. And then only she turned to Ursula, who, with all the class, had been watching the little scene between the lovers.
她亲密而俏皮地看着他良久，然后轻轻笑了一声。然后只有她转向乌苏拉，乌苏拉和全班同学一直在观看这对恋人之间的小场面。

‘How do you do, Miss Brangwen,’ sang Hermione, in her low, odd, singing fashion, that sounded almost as if she were poking fun. ‘Do you mind my coming in?’
“你好，布兰文小姐，”赫敏用她低沉、奇怪的歌声唱道，听起来几乎像是在开玩笑。 “你介意我进来吗？”

Her grey, almost sardonic eyes rested all the while on Ursula, as if summing her up.
她灰色的、近乎讽刺的眼睛始终落在乌苏拉身上，仿佛在总结她。

‘Oh no,’ said Ursula.
“哦，不，”乌苏拉说。

‘Are you SURE?’ repeated Hermione, with complete sang froid, and an odd, half-bullying effrontery.
“你确定吗？”赫敏重复道，语气完全冷静，还带着一种奇怪的、半欺负人的厚颜无耻。

‘Oh no, I like it awfully,’ laughed Ursula, a little bit excited and bewildered, because Hermione seemed to be compelling her, coming very close to her, as if intimate with her; and yet, how could she be intimate?
“哦，不，我非常喜欢它，”乌苏拉笑道，有点兴奋又困惑，因为赫敏似乎在强迫她，离她很近，好像和她很亲密；可是，她怎么可能亲密呢？

This was the answer Hermione wanted. She turned satisfied to Birkin.
这就是赫敏想要的答案。她满意地转向柏金包。

‘What are you doing?’ she sang, in her casual, inquisitive fashion.
“你在做什么？”她以随意而好奇的方式唱道。

‘Catkins,’ he replied.
“柳絮，”他回答道。

‘Really!’ she said. ‘And what do you learn about them?’ She spoke all the while in a mocking, half teasing fashion, as if making game of the whole business. She picked up a twig of the catkin, piqued by Birkin’s attention to it.
“真的！”她说。 “你从他们身上了解到了什么？”她一直以一种嘲讽、半戏弄的方式说话，仿佛在玩弄整个事情。她捡起了一根柳絮的树枝，伯金对它的关注激怒了她。

She was a strange figure in the class-room, wearing a large, old cloak of greenish cloth, on which was a raised pattern of dull gold. The high collar, and the inside of the cloak, was lined with dark fur. Beneath she had a dress of fine lavender-coloured cloth, trimmed with fur, and her hat was close-fitting, made of fur and of the dull, green-and-gold figured stuff. She was tall and strange, she looked as if she had come out of some new, bizarre picture.
她在教室里是个奇怪的人，穿着一件又大又旧的绿布斗篷，斗篷上有暗金色的凸起图案。高领和斗篷的内部衬有深色毛皮。她下面穿着一件精美的薰衣草色布料连衣裙，上面镶着毛皮，她的帽子很贴身，是用毛皮和暗绿色和金色图案的材料制成的。她又高又奇怪，看上去就像是从什么新奇的画里走出来的。

‘Do you know the little red ovary flowers, that produce the nuts? Have you ever noticed them?’ he asked her. And he came close and pointed them out to her, on the sprig she held.
“你知道结出坚果的红色小子房花吗？你注意到它们了吗？”他问她。他走近并把它们指给她看，就在她握着的小树枝上。

‘No,’ she replied. ‘What are they?’
“不，”她回答道。 '这些是什么？'

‘Those are the little seed-producing flowers, and the long catkins, they only produce pollen, to fertilise them.’
“那些是产生种子的小花，还有长长的柳絮，它们只产生花粉，让它们受精。”

‘Do they, do they!’ repeated Hermione, looking closely.
“是吗，是吗！”赫敏重复道，仔细观察。

‘From those little red bits, the nuts come; if they receive pollen from the long danglers.’
“从那些红色的小块中，坚果出来了；如果它们从长垂耳中接收到花粉。

‘Little red flames, little red flames,’ murmured Hermione to herself. And she remained for some moments looking only at the small buds out of which the red flickers of the stigma issued.
“红色的小火焰，红色的小火焰，”赫敏自言自语道。她呆了一会儿，只盯着那些小花蕾，从这些小花蕾中发出红色闪烁的柱头。

‘Aren’t they beautiful? I think they’re so beautiful,’ she said, moving close to Birkin, and pointing to the red filaments with her long, white finger.
‘她们不漂亮吗？我觉得它们太漂亮了，”她一边说，一边靠近柏金包，用她又长又白的手指指着红色的细丝。

‘Had you never noticed them before?’ he asked.
“你以前从未注意到过它们吗？”他问道。

‘No, never before,’ she replied.
“不，以前从来没有，”她回答道。

‘And now you will always see them,’ he said.
“现在你总会看到他们，”他说。

‘Now I shall always see them,’ she repeated. ‘Thank you so much for showing me. I think they’re so beautiful—little red flames—‘
“现在我会永远看到他们，”她重复道。 “非常感谢你向我展示。我认为它们是如此美丽——红色的小火焰——”

Her absorption was strange, almost rhapsodic. Both Birkin and Ursula were suspended. The little red pistillate flowers had some strange, almost mystic-passionate attraction for her.
她的全神贯注很奇怪，几乎是狂热的。伯金和乌苏拉都被停职。红色的小雌花对她有一种奇怪的、近乎神秘的热情的吸引力。

The lesson was finished, the books were put away, at last the class was dismissed. And still Hermione sat at the table, with her chin in her hand, her elbow on the table, her long white face pushed up, not attending to anything. Birkin had gone to the window, and was looking from the brilliantly-lighted room on to the grey, colourless outside, where rain was noiselessly falling. Ursula put away her things in the cupboard.
课结束了，书本收了起来，终于下课了。赫敏仍然坐在桌旁，手托着下巴，手肘支在桌子上，苍白的长脸仰起，什么也不顾。伯金走到窗前，从灯火辉煌的房间望向灰色、无色的外面，外面正无声无息地下着雨。乌苏拉把她的东西收进柜子里。

At length Hermione rose and came near to her.
最后赫敏站了起来，走到她身边。

‘Your sister has come home?’ she said.
“你姐姐回家了吗？”她说。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula.
“是的，”乌苏拉说。

‘And does she like being back in Beldover?’
“她喜欢回到贝尔多弗吗？”

‘No,’ said Ursula.
“不，”乌苏拉说。

‘No, I wonder she can bear it. It takes all my strength, to bear the ugliness of this district, when I stay here. Won’t you come and see me? Won’t you come with your sister to stay at Breadalby for a few days?—do—‘
“不，我不知道她能否忍受。当我留在这里时，我需要用尽全力来承受这个地区的丑陋。你不来看我吗？你愿意和你姐姐一起去布莱多尔比待几天吗？——做——”

‘Thank you very much,’ said Ursula.
“非常感谢你，”乌苏拉说。

‘Then I will write to you,’ said Hermione. ‘You think your sister will come? I should be so glad. I think she is wonderful. I think some of her work is really wonderful. I have two water-wagtails, carved in wood, and painted—perhaps you have seen it?’
“那我就写信给你，”赫敏说。 ‘你觉得你姐姐会来吗？我应该很高兴才对。我认为她很棒。我认为她的一些作品真的很棒。我有两条水鹡鸰，是木头雕刻的，还彩绘的——也许你见过？

‘No,’ said Ursula.
“不，”乌苏拉说。

‘I think it is perfectly wonderful—like a flash of instinct.’
“我认为这非常美妙——就像本能的一闪而过。”

‘Her little carvings ARE strange,’ said Ursula.
“她的小雕刻很奇怪，”乌苏拉说。

‘Perfectly beautiful—full of primitive passion—‘
“完美的美丽——充满原始的激情——”

‘Isn’t it queer that she always likes little things?—she must always work small things, that one can put between one’s hands, birds and tiny animals. She likes to look through the wrong end of the opera glasses, and see the world that way—why is it, do you think?’
“她总是喜欢小东西，这不是很奇怪吗？——她必须总是做小东西，那些可以放在双手之间的小东西，鸟儿和小动物。她喜欢透过望远镜的另一端看世界，并以这种方式看世界——你认为这是为什么呢？

Hermione looked down at Ursula with that long, detached scrutinising gaze that excited the younger woman.
赫敏低头看着乌苏拉，目光悠长、超然、审视，这让这位年轻女子兴奋不已。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione at length. ‘It is curious. The little things seem to be more subtle to her—‘
“是的，”赫敏最后说道。 ‘这很奇怪。这些小事对她来说似乎更加微妙——”

‘But they aren’t, are they? A mouse isn’t any more subtle than a lion, is it?’
“但他们不是，不是吗？老鼠并不比狮子更狡猾，不是吗？

Again Hermione looked down at Ursula with that long scrutiny, as if she were following some train of thought of her own, and barely attending to the other’s speech.
赫敏再次低头审视着乌苏拉，仿佛她正在遵循自己的某种思路，几乎没有注意对方的讲话。

‘I don’t know,’ she replied.
“我不知道，”她回答道。

‘Rupert, Rupert,’ she sang mildly, calling him to her. He approached in silence.
“鲁珀特，鲁珀特，”她轻声唱道，把他叫到身边。他默默地走近。

‘Are little things more subtle than big things?’ she asked, with the odd grunt of laughter in her voice, as if she were making game of him in the question.
“小事比大事更微妙吗？”她问道，声音里带着奇怪的咕哝笑声，仿佛她在问他问题。

‘Dunno,’ he said.
“不知道，”他说。

‘I hate subtleties,’ said Ursula.
“我讨厌微妙的东西，”乌苏拉说。

Hermione looked at her slowly.
赫敏慢慢地看着她。

‘Do you?’ she said.
“你是吗？”她说。

‘I always think they are a sign of weakness,’ said Ursula, up in arms, as if her prestige were threatened.
“我一直认为它们是软弱的表现，”乌苏拉说，双手高举，仿佛她的威望受到了威胁。

Hermione took no notice. Suddenly her face puckered, her brow was knit with thought, she seemed twisted in troublesome effort for utterance.
赫敏没有注意到。突然，她的脸皱了起来，眉头皱起，似乎在费力地想要说话。

‘Do you really think, Rupert,’ she asked, as if Ursula were not present, ‘do you really think it is worth while? Do you really think the children are better for being roused to consciousness?’
“鲁珀特，你真的认为，”她问道，仿佛乌苏拉不在场，“你真的认为值得吗？”你真的认为孩子们被唤醒后会更好吗？

A dark flash went over his face, a silent fury. He was hollow-cheeked and pale, almost unearthly. And the woman, with her serious, conscience-harrowing question tortured him on the quick.
他的脸上闪过一丝阴暗的光芒，一种无声的愤怒。他双颊凹陷，脸色苍白，几乎超凡脱俗。而那个女人，用她严肃的、令人良心不安的问题折磨着他。

‘They are not roused to consciousness,’ he said. ‘Consciousness comes to them, willy-nilly.’
“他们没有醒来，”他说。 “无论愿意与否，意识都会降临到他们身上。”

‘But do you think they are better for having it quickened, stimulated? Isn’t it better that they should remain unconscious of the hazel, isn’t it better that they should see as a whole, without all this pulling to pieces, all this knowledge?’
“但是你认为他们因为加速、刺激而变得更好吗？”他们应该对榛树保持无意识，而不是把所有这些知识都看成一个整体，而不是把所有这些知识撕成碎片，这不是更好吗？

‘Would you rather, for yourself, know or not know, that the little red flowers are there, putting out for the pollen?’ he asked harshly. His voice was brutal, scornful, cruel.
“你自己愿意知道还是不知道，红色的小花就在那儿，为花粉而努力？”他严厉地问道。他的声音粗暴、轻蔑、残忍。

Hermione remained with her face lifted up, abstracted. He hung silent in irritation.
赫敏仍然抬起头，心不在焉。他恼怒地沉默不语。

‘I don’t know,’ she replied, balancing mildly. ‘I don’t know.’
“我不知道，”她回答道，温和地保持着平衡。 '我不知道。'

‘But knowing is everything to you, it is all your life,’ he broke out. She slowly looked at him.
“但了解对你来说就是一切，它就是你的全部生活，”他突然说道。她慢慢地看着他。

‘Is it?’ she said.
“是吗？”她说。

‘To know, that is your all, that is your life—you have only this, this knowledge,’ he cried. ‘There is only one tree, there is only one fruit, in your mouth.’
“要知道，这就是你的全部，这就是你的生活——你只有这个，这个知识，”他喊道。 “你嘴里只有一棵树，只有一种水果。”

Again she was some time silent.
她又沉默了一会儿。

‘Is there?’ she said at last, with the same untouched calm. And then in a tone of whimsical inquisitiveness: ‘What fruit, Rupert?’
“有吗？”她最后说道，语气一如既往地平静。然后用一种异想天开的好奇语气问道：“鲁珀特，什么水果？”

‘The eternal apple,’ he replied in exasperation, hating his own metaphors.
“永恒的苹果，”他愤怒地回答，讨厌自己的比喻。

‘Yes,’ she said. There was a look of exhaustion about her. For some moments there was silence. Then, pulling herself together with a convulsed movement, Hermione resumed, in a sing-song, casual voice:
“是的，”她说。她的神情显得疲惫不堪。一阵沉默。然后，赫敏用抽搐的动作让自己振作起来，用一种歌唱般的、随意的声音继续说道：

‘But leaving me apart, Rupert; do you think the children are better, richer, happier, for all this knowledge; do you really think they are? Or is it better to leave them untouched, spontaneous. Hadn’t they better be animals, simple animals, crude, violent, ANYTHING, rather than this self-consciousness, this incapacity to be spontaneous.’
“但是把我分开吧，鲁珀特；你认为孩子们因为有了这些知识而变得更好、更富有、更快乐吗？你真的认为他们是吗？或者最好让它们不受影响，自发地进行。难道他们最好是动物，简单的动物，粗鲁的，暴力的，任何东西，而不是这种自我意识，这种自发性的无能。

They thought she had finished. But with a queer rumbling in her throat she resumed, ‘Hadn’t they better be anything than grow up crippled, crippled in their souls, crippled in their feelings—so thrown back—so turned back on themselves—incapable—‘ Hermione clenched her fist like one in a trance—‘of any spontaneous action, always deliberate, always burdened with choice, never carried away.’
他们以为她已经完成了。但她的喉咙里发出奇怪的隆隆声，她接着说道：“如果他们长大后不就变得残废了，他们的灵魂残废了，他们的感情残废了——如此落后——如此背弃自己——无能——”赫敏紧紧地抱住了她拳头就像恍惚的人一样——“任何自发的行动，总是深思熟虑的，总是背负着选择的重担，从不忘乎所以。”

Again they thought she had finished. But just as he was going to reply, she resumed her queer rhapsody—‘never carried away, out of themselves, always conscious, always self-conscious, always aware of themselves. Isn’t ANYTHING better than this? Better be animals, mere animals with no mind at all, than this, this NOTHINGNESS—‘
他们再次认为她已经完成了。但正当他要回答时，她又恢复了她的酷儿狂想曲——“永远不忘乎所以，脱离自我，总是有意识的，总是不自在的，总是意识到自己的。”难道没有比这更好的了吗？最好是动物，纯粹是没有思想的动物，也比这个、这个虚无——’

‘But do you think it is knowledge that makes us unliving and selfconscious?’ he asked irritably.
“但是你认为是知识让我们失去了生命和自我意识吗？”他烦躁地问道。

She opened her eyes and looked at him slowly.
她睁开眼睛，慢慢地看着他。

‘Yes,’ she said. She paused, watching him all the while, her eyes vague. Then she wiped her fingers across her brow, with a vague weariness. It irritated him bitterly. ‘It is the mind,’ she said, ‘and that is death.’ She raised her eyes slowly to him: ‘Isn’t the mind—‘ she said, with the convulsed movement of her body, ‘isn’t it our death? Doesn’t it destroy all our spontaneity, all our instincts? Are not the young people growing up today, really dead before they have a chance to live?’
“是的，”她说。她停了下来，一直看着他，眼神模糊。然后她用手指擦了擦额头，带着一丝疲倦。这让他非常恼火。 “这是心灵，”她说，“那就是死亡。”她慢慢地抬起眼睛看着他：“心灵难道不是——”她说，身体抽搐着，“这难道不是我们的生命吗？”死亡？它不是摧毁了我们所有的自发性、所有的本能吗？现在长大的年轻人不都是还没来得及活就死了吗？

‘Not because they have too much mind, but too little,’ he said brutally.
“不是因为他们有太多的头脑，而是太少了，”他残酷地说。

‘Are you SURE?’ she cried. ‘It seems to me the reverse. They are overconscious, burdened to death with consciousness.’
“你确定吗？”她喊道。 ‘在我看来，情况恰恰相反。他们意识过度，意识负担重得要死。

‘Imprisoned within a limited, false set of concepts,’ he cried.
“被囚禁在一套有限的、错误的概念中，”他喊道。

But she took no notice of this, only went on with her own rhapsodic interrogation.
但她并没有在意这些，只是继续自己狂想曲的审问。

‘When we have knowledge, don’t we lose everything but knowledge?’ she asked pathetically. ‘If I know about the flower, don’t I lose the flower and have only the knowledge? Aren’t we exchanging the substance for the shadow, aren’t we forfeiting life for this dead quality of knowledge? And what does it mean to me, after all? What does all this knowing mean to me? It means nothing.’
“当我们拥有知识时，我们不是会失去除了知识之外的一切吗？”她可怜兮兮地问道。 ‘如果我知道这朵花，我岂不是会失去这朵花而只剩下知识吗？我们不是用实体来换取影子，不是用生命来换取这种死气沉沉的知识吗？毕竟，这对我来说意味着什么？所有这些知识对我来说意味着什么？这不代表任何意思。'

‘You are merely making words,’ he said; ‘knowledge means everything to you. Even your animalism, you want it in your head. You don’t want to BE an animal, you want to observe your own animal functions, to get a mental thrill out of them. It is all purely secondary—and more decadent than the most hide-bound intellectualism. What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts? Passion and the instincts—you want them hard enough, but through your head, in your consciousness. It all takes place in your head, under that skull of yours. Only you won’t be conscious of what ACTUALLY is: you want the lie that will match the rest of your furniture.’
“你只是说说而已，”他说。 ‘知识对你来说意味着一切。即使是你的兽性，你也希望它存在于你的脑海中。你不想成为一种动物，你想观察自己的动物功能，并从中获得精神上的刺激。这一切都纯粹是次要的——而且比最顽固的知性主义更加颓废。这不就是最糟糕和最后形式的理智主义，即你对激情和动物本能的热爱吗？激情和本能——你非常想要它们，但要通过你的头脑，在你的意识中。这一切都发生在你的头脑中，在你的头骨下面。只是你不会意识到到底是什么：你想要一个能与你的其他家具相匹配的谎言。

Hermione set hard and poisonous against this attack. Ursula stood covered with wonder and shame. It frightened her, to see how they hated each other.
赫敏对这次攻击采取了严厉而有毒的态度。乌苏拉站在那里，满脸惊奇和羞愧。看到他们如此憎恨对方，她感到害怕。

‘It’s all that Lady of Shalott business,’ he said, in his strong abstract voice. He seemed to be charging her before the unseeing air. ‘You’ve got that mirror, your own fixed will, your immortal understanding, your own tight conscious world, and there is nothing beyond it. There, in the mirror, you must have everything. But now you have come to all your conclusions, you want to go back and be like a savage, without knowledge. You want a life of pure sensation and ‘passion.‘‘
“这都是夏洛特夫人的事，”他用强烈抽象的声音说道。他似乎在看不见的空气前冲向她。 ‘你拥有那面镜子，你自己固定的意志，你不朽的理解力，你自己紧密的意识世界，除此之外没有任何东西。在那里，镜子里，你一定拥有一切。但现在你已经得出了所有的结论，你想回去像个野蛮人一样，没有知识。你想要一种纯粹的感觉和“激情”的生活。

He quoted the last word satirically against her. She sat convulsed with fury and violation, speechless, like a stricken pythoness of the Greek oracle.
他引用最后一句话来讽刺她。她坐在那里，因愤怒和侵犯而浑身抽搐，说不出话来，就像希腊神谕中受伤的女巫。

‘But your passion is a lie,’ he went on violently. ‘It isn’t passion at all, it is your WILL. It’s your bullying will. You want to clutch things and have them in your power. You want to have things in your power. And why? Because you haven’t got any real body, any dark sensual body of life. You have no sensuality. You have only your will and your conceit of consciousness, and your lust for power, to KNOW.’
“但你的热情是一个谎言，”他猛烈地继续说道。 ‘这根本不是激情，而是你的意志。这是你的欺凌意志。你想要抓住事物并把它们掌握在你的手中。你想要掌控一切。为什么？因为你没有任何真实的身体，任何黑暗的肉欲生命体。你没有肉欲。你只有你的意志和你的意识自负，以及你对权力的渴望，才能知道。

He looked at her in mingled hate and contempt, also in pain because she suffered, and in shame because he knew he tortured her. He had an impulse to kneel and plead for forgiveness. But a bitterer red anger burned up to fury in him. He became unconscious of her, he was only a passionate voice speaking.
他看着她，眼神里充满了仇恨和蔑视，也因为她所受的痛苦而感到痛苦，因为他知道自己折磨了她而感到羞耻。他有一种想下跪求饶的冲动。但一股更强烈的红色愤怒在他心中燃烧起来。他对她失去了知觉，只是用充满激情的声音说话。

‘Spontaneous!’ he cried. ‘You and spontaneity! You, the most deliberate thing that ever walked or crawled! You’d be verily deliberately spontaneous—that’s you. Because you want to have everything in your own volition, your deliberate voluntary consciousness. You want it all in that loathsome little skull of yours, that ought to be cracked like a nut. For you’ll be the same till it is cracked, like an insect in its skin. If one cracked your skull perhaps one might get a spontaneous, passionate woman out of you, with real sensuality. As it is, what you want is pornography—looking at yourself in mirrors, watching your naked animal actions in mirrors, so that you can have it all in your consciousness, make it all mental.’
“自发的！”他喊道。 ‘你和自发性！你，是有史以来行走或爬行中最从容的生物！你会非常刻意地自发——那就是你。因为你想要一切都在你自己的意志、你刻意的自愿意识中。你想要这一切都在你那个令人厌恶的小头骨里，它应该像坚果一样被敲碎。因为在它破裂之前你都会保持原状，就像皮肤上的昆虫一样。如果有人敲碎你的头骨，也许有人会从你身上得到一个自发、热情的女人，具有真正的性感。事实上，你想要的是色情——在镜子里看着你自己，在镜子里看着你赤裸的动物行为，这样你就可以把这一切都放在你的意识里，让它全部变成精神上的。

There was a sense of violation in the air, as if too much was said, the unforgivable. Yet Ursula was concerned now only with solving her own problems, in the light of his words. She was pale and abstracted.
空气中弥漫着一股违和感，仿佛说的太多了，不可原谅。然而，根据他的话，乌苏拉现在只关心解决自己的问题。她脸色苍白，心不在焉。

‘But do you really WANT sensuality?’ she asked, puzzled.
“但你真的想要性感吗？”她困惑地问道。

Birkin looked at her, and became intent in his explanation.
伯金看着她，全神贯注地解释着。

‘Yes,’ he said, ‘that and nothing else, at this point. It is a fulfilment—the great dark knowledge you can’t have in your head—the dark involuntary being. It is death to one’s self—but it is the coming into being of another.’
“是的，”他说，“目前仅此而已。”这是一种满足——你头脑中无法拥有的伟大黑暗知识——黑暗的不自觉的存在。这是一个人自我的死亡，但却是另一个人的诞生。

‘But how? How can you have knowledge not in your head?’ she asked, quite unable to interpret his phrases.
‘但是怎么办呢？你怎么可能脑子里没有知识呢？”她问道，完全无法理解他的话。

‘In the blood,’ he answered; ‘when the mind and the known world is drowned in darkness everything must go—there must be the deluge. Then you find yourself a palpable body of darkness, a demon—‘
“在血中，”他回答道。 “当思想和已知的世界被黑暗淹没时，一切都必须消失——一定会有洪水。”然后你发现自己是一个明显的黑暗身体，一个恶魔——”

‘But why should I be a demon—?’ she asked.
“但我为什么要成为恶魔——？”她问道。

‘’WOMAN WAILING FOR HER DEMON LOVER’—‘ he quoted—‘why, I don’t know.’
“女人为她的恶魔情人哭泣”——他引用道——“为什么，我不知道。”

Hermione roused herself as from a death—annihilation.
赫敏从死亡——毁灭中惊醒过来。

‘He is such a DREADFUL satanist, isn’t he?’ she drawled to Ursula, in a queer resonant voice, that ended on a shrill little laugh of pure ridicule. The two women were jeering at him, jeering him into nothingness. The laugh of the shrill, triumphant female sounded from Hermione, jeering him as if he were a neuter.
“他真是个可怕的撒旦教徒，不是吗？”她用一种奇怪而洪亮的声音慢吞吞地对乌苏拉说道，最后以纯粹嘲讽的尖锐小笑声结束。两个女人都在嘲笑他，把他嘲笑得化为虚无。赫敏的口中传来那女人尖利而得意的笑声，嘲笑他就好像他是个中性人一样。

‘No,’ he said. ‘You are the real devil who won’t let life exist.’
“不，”他说。 “你才是真正的恶魔，不让生命存在。”

She looked at him with a long, slow look, malevolent, supercilious.
她用一种漫长而缓慢的眼神看着他，眼神恶毒而傲慢。

‘You know all about it, don’t you?’ she said, with slow, cold, cunning mockery.
“你都知道这一切，不是吗？”她缓慢地、冷酷地、狡猾地嘲讽道。

‘Enough,’ he replied, his face fixing fine and clear like steel. A horrible despair, and at the same time a sense of release, liberation, came over Hermione. She turned with a pleasant intimacy to Ursula.
“够了，”他回答道，他的脸像钢铁一样坚毅而清晰。赫敏感到一种可怕的绝望，同时又感到一种解脱、解放。她转向乌苏拉，态度愉快而亲密。

‘You are sure you will come to Breadalby?’ she said, urging.
“你确定你会来布莱多尔比吗？”她催促道。

‘Yes, I should like to very much,’ replied Ursula.
“是的，我非常愿意，”乌苏拉回答道。

Hermione looked down at her, gratified, reflecting, and strangely absent, as if possessed, as if not quite there.
赫敏低头看着她，心满意足，沉思着，但奇怪的是，她心不在焉，仿佛着魔了，又好像不在那儿。

‘I’m so glad,’ she said, pulling herself together. ‘Some time in about a fortnight. Yes? I will write to you here, at the school, shall I? Yes. And you’ll be sure to come? Yes. I shall be so glad. Good-bye! Good-bye!’
“我很高兴，”她振作起来说道。 “大约两周后的某个时间。是的？我会在学校给你写信，可以吗？是的。而你一定会来吗？是的。我会很高兴的。再见！再见！'

Hermione held out her hand and looked into the eyes of the other woman. She knew Ursula as an immediate rival, and the knowledge strangely exhilarated her. Also she was taking leave. It always gave her a sense of strength, advantage, to be departing and leaving the other behind. Moreover she was taking the man with her, if only in hate.
赫敏伸出手，看着另一个女人的眼睛。她知道乌苏拉是她直接的竞争对手，这个想法让她感到异常兴奋。她也请假了。离开并把对方抛在身后，总是给她一种力量、优势的感觉。而且，她带着这个男人一起走，哪怕只是出于仇恨。

Birkin stood aside, fixed and unreal. But now, when it was his turn to bid good-bye, he began to speak again.
伯金站在一旁，一动不动，不真实。但现在，轮到他告别的时候，他又开始说话了。

‘There’s the whole difference in the world,’ he said, ‘between the actual sensual being, and the vicious mental-deliberate profligacy our lot goes in for. In our night-time, there’s always the electricity switched on, we watch ourselves, we get it all in the head, really. You’ve got to lapse out before you can know what sensual reality is, lapse into unknowingness, and give up your volition. You’ve got to do it. You’ve got to learn not-to-be, before you can come into being.
他说：“现实的感官存在与我们的命运所追求的邪恶的精神上的挥霍之间存在着完全的区别。”在我们的夜晚，总是有电，我们观察自己，我们把这一切都记在脑子里，真的。你必须先迷失，才能知道什么是欲界实相，陷入无明，并放弃你的意志。你必须这么做。在你成为存在之前，你必须先学会“不存在”。

‘But we have got such a conceit of ourselves—that’s where it is. We are so conceited, and so unproud. We’ve got no pride, we’re all conceit, so conceited in our own papier-mache realised selves. We’d rather die than give up our little self-righteous self-opinionated self-will.’
“但我们对自己太自负了——那就是这样。我们是如此的自负，又如此的不骄傲。我们没有骄傲，我们都是自负，对我们纸质的自我实现如此自负。我们宁愿死，也不愿放弃我们那点自以为是、自以为是的自我意志。”

There was silence in the room. Both women were hostile and resentful. He sounded as if he were addressing a meeting. Hermione merely paid no attention, stood with her shoulders tight in a shrug of dislike.
房间里一片寂静。两个女人都充满敌意和怨恨。他听起来就像是在开会讲话。赫敏根本不予理睬，耸耸肩膀，不喜欢地站在那里。

Ursula was watching him as if furtively, not really aware of what she was seeing. There was a great physical attractiveness in him—a curious hidden richness, that came through his thinness and his pallor like another voice, conveying another knowledge of him. It was in the curves of his brows and his chin, rich, fine, exquisite curves, the powerful beauty of life itself. She could not say what it was. But there was a sense of richness and of liberty.
乌苏拉仿佛偷偷地看着他，并没有真正意识到自己看到了什么。他身上有一种巨大的外表吸引力——一种奇怪的隐藏的丰富性，通过他的瘦弱和苍白而显现出来，就像另一种声音，传达着对他的另一种认识。就在他眉毛和下巴的曲线上，丰富、细腻、精致的曲线，是生命本身的强大之美。她说不出那是什么。但有一种丰富和自由的感觉。

‘But we are sensual enough, without making ourselves so, aren’t we?’ she asked, turning to him with a certain golden laughter flickering under her greenish eyes, like a challenge. And immediately the queer, careless, terribly attractive smile came over his eyes and brows, though his mouth did not relax.
“但我们足够感性，但又不需要让自己变得如此，不是吗？”她转向他问道，绿色的眼睛下闪烁着金色的笑声，就像一个挑战。立刻，他的眼睛和眉毛上浮现出了一种奇怪的、漫不经心的、极其迷人的微笑，尽管他的嘴并没有放松。

‘No,’ he said, ‘we aren’t. We’re too full of ourselves.’
“不，”他说，“我们不是。”我们太自满了。

‘Surely it isn’t a matter of conceit,’ she cried.
“这当然不是自负的问题，”她喊道。

‘That and nothing else.’
“仅此而已。”

She was frankly puzzled.
坦白说她很困惑。

‘Don’t you think that people are most conceited of all about their sensual powers?’ she asked.
“你不认为人们对自己的感官力量最为自负吗？”她问道。

‘That’s why they aren’t sensual—only sensuous—which is another matter. They’re ALWAYS aware of themselves—and they’re so conceited, that rather than release themselves, and live in another world, from another centre, they’d—‘
‘这就是为什么他们不感性——只是感性——这是另一回事。他们总是意识到自己——而且他们是如此自负，以至于他们不会释放自己，从另一个中心生活在另一个世界，他们会——”

‘You want your tea, don’t you,’ said Hermione, turning to Ursula with a gracious kindliness. ‘You’ve worked all day—‘
“你想要茶，不是吗？”赫敏说着，带着亲切的善意转向乌苏拉。 “你工作了一整天——”

Birkin stopped short. A spasm of anger and chagrin went over Ursula. His face set. And he bade good-bye, as if he had ceased to notice her.
伯金突然停了下来。乌苏拉心中一阵愤怒和懊恼。他的脸色铁青。他告别了，就好像他不再注意到她一样。

They were gone. Ursula stood looking at the door for some moments. Then she put out the lights. And having done so, she sat down again in her chair, absorbed and lost. And then she began to cry, bitterly, bitterly weeping: but whether for misery or joy, she never knew.
他们走了。乌苏拉站在门口看了一会儿。然后她关了灯。做完这些之后，她又坐回椅子上，全神贯注、茫然若失。然后她开始哭，哭得很伤心，哭得很伤心：但她不知道是因为痛苦还是快乐。

CHAPTER IV
第四章

DIVER
潜水员

The week passed away. On the Saturday it rained, a soft drizzling rain that held off at times. In one of the intervals Gudrun and Ursula set out for a walk, going towards Willey Water. The atmosphere was grey and translucent, the birds sang sharply on the young twigs, the earth would be quickening and hastening in growth. The two girls walked swiftly, gladly, because of the soft, subtle rush of morning that filled the wet haze. By the road the black-thorn was in blossom, white and wet, its tiny amber grains burning faintly in the white smoke of blossom. Purple twigs were darkly luminous in the grey air, high hedges glowed like living shadows, hovering nearer, coming into creation. The morning was full of a new creation.
一周过去了。周六，下了一场小雨，细雨绵绵，时而下，时而停。有一次，古德伦和乌苏拉出发去威利沃特散步。空气灰蒙蒙的，半透明的，鸟儿在嫩枝上高声歌唱，大地正在加速生长。两个女孩走得很快，很高兴，因为早晨的轻柔而微妙的冲刷充满了潮湿的薄雾。路边的黑刺李正在开花，洁白而潮湿，微小的琥珀色颗粒在花朵的白烟中微弱地燃烧。紫色的树枝在灰色的空气中发出暗色的光芒，高高的树篱像活生生的影子一样闪闪发光，盘旋在更近的地方，正在创造。早晨充满了新的创造。

When the sisters came to Willey Water, the lake lay all grey and visionary, stretching into the moist, translucent vista of trees and meadow. Fine electric activity in sound came from the dumbles below the road, the birds piping one against the other, and water mysteriously plashing, issuing from the lake.
当姐妹俩来到威利沃特时，湖水一片灰蒙蒙的，梦幻般的，延伸到潮湿、半透明的树木和草地上。路下的灌木丛中传来细微的电击声，鸟儿一只一只地鸣叫，湖水神秘地溅起水花。

The two girls drifted swiftly along. In front of them, at the corner of the lake, near the road, was a mossy boat-house under a walnut tree, and a little landing-stage where a boat was moored, wavering like a shadow on the still grey water, below the green, decayed poles. All was shadowy with coming summer.
两个女孩走得很快。在他们前面，在湖的一角，靠近公路，有一棵核桃树下有一座长满青苔的船库，还有一个小码头，停泊着一艘船，船像影子一样在下面平静的灰色水面上摇曳。绿色、腐烂的两极。随着夏天的到来，一切都变得阴暗起来。

Suddenly, from the boat-house, a white figure ran out, frightening in its swift sharp transit, across the old landing-stage. It launched in a white arc through the air, there was a bursting of the water, and among the smooth ripples a swimmer was making out to space, in a centre of faintly heaving motion. The whole otherworld, wet and remote, he had to himself. He could move into the pure translucency of the grey, uncreated water.
突然，一个白色的身影从船库跑了出来，穿过旧的码头，速度之快令人恐惧。它在空中划出一道白色的弧线，水面发出一阵爆裂声，在平滑的涟漪中，有一个游泳者正在向太空游去，中心正在微弱地起伏运动。整个另一个世界，潮湿又遥远，只有他一个人。他可以进入纯粹半透明的灰色、非受造之水。

Gudrun stood by the stone wall, watching.
古德伦站在石墙边看着。

‘How I envy him,’ she said, in low, desirous tones.
“我多么羡慕他啊，”她低声说道，充满渴望。

‘Ugh!’ shivered Ursula. ‘So cold!’
“呃！”乌苏拉颤抖着。 '好冷！'

‘Yes, but how good, how really fine, to swim out there!’ The sisters stood watching the swimmer move further into the grey, moist, full space of the water, pulsing with his own small, invading motion, and arched over with mist and dim woods.
“是的，但是，能游到那里去，真是太好了，真是太好了！”姐妹们站在那里，看着游泳者进一步游进灰色、潮湿、充满水的空间，随着他自己微小的、侵入性的动作而跳动，并用力弓起身子。薄雾和昏暗的树林。

‘Don’t you wish it were you?’ asked Gudrun, looking at Ursula.
“你不希望是你吗？”古德兰看着乌苏拉问道。

‘I do,’ said Ursula. ‘But I’m not sure—it’s so wet.’
“我愿意，”乌苏拉说。 “但我不确定——太湿了。”

‘No,’ said Gudrun, reluctantly. She stood watching the motion on the bosom of the water, as if fascinated. He, having swum a certain distance, turned round and was swimming on his back, looking along the water at the two girls by the wall. In the faint wash of motion, they could see his ruddy face, and could feel him watching them.
“不，”古德伦不情愿地说。她站在那里，注视着水面上的动静，仿佛着了迷。他游了一段距离，转过身来，仰面游着，顺着水流看着墙边的两个女孩。在微弱的运动声中，他们可以看到他红润的脸，也能感觉到他在注视着他们。

‘It is Gerald Crich,’ said Ursula.
“我是杰拉尔德·克里奇，”乌苏拉说。

‘I know,’ replied Gudrun.
“我知道，”古德伦回答道。

And she stood motionless gazing over the water at the face which washed up and down on the flood, as he swam steadily. From his separate element he saw them and he exulted to himself because of his own advantage, his possession of a world to himself. He was immune and perfect. He loved his own vigorous, thrusting motion, and the violent impulse of the very cold water against his limbs, buoying him up. He could see the girls watching him a way off, outside, and that pleased him. He lifted his arm from the water, in a sign to them.
她一动不动地站着，凝视着水面，看着他在洪水中上下起伏的脸庞，而他则平稳地游着。他从自己独立的元素中看到了它们，并为自己感到高兴，因为他自己的优势，他拥有一个属于自己的世界。他免疫且完美。他喜欢自己充满活力的冲刺动作，以及极冷的水对他的四肢的猛烈冲击，使他浮起来。他可以看到女孩们在外面远处看着他，这让他很高兴。他从水中抬起手臂，向他们示意。

‘He is waving,’ said Ursula.
“他在挥手，”乌苏拉说。

‘Yes,’ replied Gudrun. They watched him. He waved again, with a strange movement of recognition across the difference.
“是的，”古德伦回答道。他们看着他。他再次挥手，带着一种奇怪的动作，表示认识到了差异。

‘Like a Nibelung,’ laughed Ursula. Gudrun said nothing, only stood still looking over the water.
“就像尼伯龙根一样，”乌苏拉笑着说。古德伦什么也没说，只是静静地站着，看着水面。

Gerald suddenly turned, and was swimming away swiftly, with a side stroke. He was alone now, alone and immune in the middle of the waters, which he had all to himself. He exulted in his isolation in the new element, unquestioned and unconditioned. He was happy, thrusting with his legs and all his body, without bond or connection anywhere, just himself in the watery world.
杰拉德突然转身，侧身游去。他现在孤身一人，独自一人，在这片水域中毫无抵抗力，这片水域完全属于他自己。他对自己在新元素中的孤立感到欣喜若狂，毫无疑问，不受任何限制。他很高兴，用他的腿和他的整个身体推动，没有任何束缚或联系，只有他自己在水世界里。

Gudrun envied him almost painfully. Even this momentary possession of pure isolation and fluidity seemed to her so terribly desirable that she felt herself as if damned, out there on the high-road.
古德伦几乎痛苦地嫉妒他。即使是这种短暂的纯粹的孤立和流动性对她来说也是如此令人向往，以至于她觉得自己仿佛被诅咒了，在高速公路上。

‘God, what it is to be a man!’ she cried.
“上帝啊，作为一个男人意味着什么！”她喊道。

‘What?’ exclaimed Ursula in surprise.
“什么？”乌苏拉惊讶地叫道。

‘The freedom, the liberty, the mobility!’ cried Gudrun, strangely flushed and brilliant. ‘You’re a man, you want to do a thing, you do it. You haven’t the THOUSAND obstacles a woman has in front of her.’
“自由，自由，机动性！”古德伦喊道，他脸色异常红润，神采飞扬。 ‘你是一个男人，你想做一件事，你就去做。女人面前没有成千上万的障碍。

Ursula wondered what was in Gudrun’s mind, to occasion this outburst. She could not understand.
乌苏拉想知道古德伦脑子里到底在想什么，才会引起这种爆发。她无法理解。

‘What do you want to do?’ she asked.
“你想做什么？”她问。

‘Nothing,’ cried Gudrun, in swift refutation. ‘But supposing I did. Supposing I want to swim up that water. It is impossible, it is one of the impossibilities of life, for me to take my clothes off now and jump in. But isn’t it RIDICULOUS, doesn’t it simply prevent our living!’
“没什么，”古德伦大声反驳道。 “但假设我这么做了。假设我想游到那个水里。对我来说，现在脱掉衣服跳进去是不可能的，这是生活中不可能的事情之一。但这不是很荒谬吗？这不是妨碍我们的生活吗！

She was so hot, so flushed, so furious, that Ursula was puzzled.
她是如此的热情、如此的红润、如此的愤怒，让乌苏拉感到困惑。

The two sisters went on, up the road. They were passing between the trees just below Shortlands. They looked up at the long, low house, dim and glamorous in the wet morning, its cedar trees slanting before the windows. Gudrun seemed to be studying it closely.
两姐妹继续往前走。他们正从肖特兰兹下方的树林间经过。他们抬头看着那栋又长又低的房子，在潮湿的早晨显得昏暗而迷人，雪松树斜倚在窗前。古德伦似乎正在仔细研究它。

‘Don’t you think it’s attractive, Ursula?’ asked Gudrun.
“你不觉得这很有吸引力吗，乌苏拉？”古德伦问。

‘Very,’ said Ursula. ‘Very peaceful and charming.’
“非常，”乌苏拉说。 “非常平静和迷人。”

‘It has form, too—it has a period.’
“它也有形式——它有一个时期。”

‘What period?’
“什么时期？”

‘Oh, eighteenth century, for certain; Dorothy Wordsworth and Jane Austen, don’t you think?’
“哦，当然是十八世纪；多萝西·华兹华斯和简·奥斯汀，你不这么认为吗？

Ursula laughed.
乌苏拉笑了。

‘Don’t you think so?’ repeated Gudrun.
“你不这么认为吗？”古德伦重复道。

‘Perhaps. But I don’t think the Criches fit the period. I know Gerald is putting in a private electric plant, for lighting the house, and is making all kinds of latest improvements.’
'也许。但我认为克里奇们不适合那个时代。我知道杰拉德正在建造一座私人发电厂，为房子提供照明，并正在进行各种最新的改进。

Gudrun shrugged her shoulders swiftly.
古珍迅速耸耸肩。

‘Of course,’ she said, ‘that’s quite inevitable.’
“当然，”她说，“这是不可避免的。”

‘Quite,’ laughed Ursula. ‘He is several generations of youngness at one go. They hate him for it. He takes them all by the scruff of the neck, and fairly flings them along. He’ll have to die soon, when he’s made every possible improvement, and there will be nothing more to improve. He’s got GO, anyhow.’
“确实如此，”乌苏拉笑道。 ‘他一下子年轻了好几代。他们因此恨他。他抓住他们所有人的颈背，然后把他们扔了出去。当他已经做出了一切可能的改进时，他很快就会死去，而且再也没有什么可以改进的了。不管怎样，他已经走了。

‘Certainly, he’s got go,’ said Gudrun. ‘In fact I’ve never seen a man that showed signs of so much. The unfortunate thing is, where does his GO go to, what becomes of it?’
“当然，他得走了，”古德伦说。 “事实上，我从未见过一个人表现出如此多的迹象。不幸的是，他的 GO 去了哪里，变成了什么样子？

‘Oh I know,’ said Ursula. ‘It goes in applying the latest appliances!’
“哦，我知道，”乌苏拉说。 “它涉及应用最新的设备！”

‘Exactly,’ said Gudrun.
“完全正确，”古德伦说。

‘You know he shot his brother?’ said Ursula.
“你知道他射杀了他的兄弟吗？”乌苏拉说。

‘Shot his brother?’ cried Gudrun, frowning as if in disapprobation.
“枪杀了他的兄弟？”古德伦喊道，皱着眉头，仿佛表示不满。

‘Didn’t you know? Oh yes!—I thought you knew. He and his brother were playing together with a gun. He told his brother to look down the gun, and it was loaded, and blew the top of his head off. Isn’t it a horrible story?’
‘你不知道吗？哦，是的！——我以为你知道。他和他的兄弟正在一起玩枪。他让他的兄弟低头看枪，枪已经上膛，把他的头顶炸掉了。这不是一个可怕的故事吗？

‘How fearful!’ cried Gudrun. ‘But it is long ago?’
“多可怕啊！”古德伦喊道。 “但那是很久以前的事了？”

‘Oh yes, they were quite boys,’ said Ursula. ‘I think it is one of the most horrible stories I know.’
“哦，是的，他们都是男孩，”乌苏拉说。 “我认为这是我所知道的最可怕的故事之一。”

‘And he of course did not know that the gun was loaded?’
“他当然不知道枪已经上膛了？”

‘Yes. You see it was an old thing that had been lying in the stable for years. Nobody dreamed it would ever go off, and of course, no one imagined it was loaded. But isn’t it dreadful, that it should happen?’
'是的。你看，这是一件在马厩里躺了很多年的旧东西。没有人想到它会爆炸，当然，也没有人想到它是装载着的。但这会发生，这不是很可怕吗？

‘Frightful!’ cried Gudrun. ‘And isn’t it horrible too to think of such a thing happening to one, when one was a child, and having to carry the responsibility of it all through one’s life. Imagine it, two boys playing together—then this comes upon them, for no reason whatever—out of the air. Ursula, it’s very frightening! Oh, it’s one of the things I can’t bear. Murder, that is thinkable, because there’s a will behind it. But a thing like that to HAPPEN to one—‘
“太可怕了！”古德伦叫道。 “当一个人还是个孩子的时候，想到这样的事情发生在一个人身上，并且必须一生承担这件事的责任，这不是太可怕了吗？”想象一下，两个男孩一起玩耍——然后这一切突然降临到他们身上，没有任何原因——从空中。乌苏拉，这太可怕了！哦，这是我无法忍受的事情之一。谋杀，这是可以想象的，因为背后有意志。但这样的事情发生在一个人身上——”

‘Perhaps there WAS an unconscious will behind it,’ said Ursula. ‘This playing at killing has some primitive DESIRE for killing in it, don’t you think?’
“也许这背后有一种无意识的意志，”乌苏拉说。 “这种杀戮游戏里有一些原始的杀戮欲望，你不觉得吗？”

‘Desire!’ said Gudrun, coldly, stiffening a little. ‘I can’t see that they were even playing at killing. I suppose one boy said to the other, ‘You look down the barrel while I pull the trigger, and see what happens.’ It seems to me the purest form of accident.’
“欲望！”古德伦冷冷地说，身体变得有些僵硬。 “我看不出他们甚至在玩杀人游戏。我想一个男孩对另一个男孩说：“当我扣动扳机时，你往下看枪管，看看会发生什么。”在我看来，这似乎是最纯粹的意外形式。

‘No,’ said Ursula. ‘I couldn’t pull the trigger of the emptiest gun in the world, not if some-one were looking down the barrel. One instinctively doesn’t do it—one can’t.’
“不，”乌苏拉说。 “如果有人向下看枪管，我就无法扣动世界上最空的枪的扳机。一个人本能地不会这样做——一个人不能。”

Gudrun was silent for some moments, in sharp disagreement.
古德伦沉默了一会儿，表现出强烈的分歧。

‘Of course,’ she said coldly. ‘If one is a woman, and grown up, one’s instinct prevents one. But I cannot see how that applies to a couple of boys playing together.’
“当然，”她冷冷地说。 “如果一个人是一名成年女性，他的本能就会阻止他这样做。但我不明白这如何适用于几个一起玩耍的男孩。

Her voice was cold and angry.
她的声音冰冷而愤怒。

‘Yes,’ persisted Ursula. At that moment they heard a woman’s voice a few yards off say loudly:
“是的，”乌苏拉坚持道。就在这时，他们听到几米外一个女人的声音大声说道：

‘Oh damn the thing!’ They went forward and saw Laura Crich and Hermione Roddice in the field on the other side of the hedge, and Laura Crich struggling with the gate, to get out. Ursula at once hurried up and helped to lift the gate.
“哦，该死的东西！”他们向前走去，看到劳拉·克里奇和赫敏·罗迪斯在树篱另一边的田野里，劳拉·克里奇正在门外挣扎，想要出去。乌苏拉立刻赶忙上前帮忙把门打开。

‘Thanks so much,’ said Laura, looking up flushed and amazon-like, yet rather confused. ‘It isn’t right on the hinges.’
“非常感谢。”劳拉抬起头，脸涨得通红，像个亚马逊人，但又很困惑。 “铰链不正确。”

‘No,’ said Ursula. ‘And they’re so heavy.’
“不，”乌苏拉说。 “而且它们太重了。”

‘Surprising!’ cried Laura.
“太令人惊讶了！”劳拉喊道。

‘How do you do,’ sang Hermione, from out of the field, the moment she could make her voice heard. ‘It’s nice now. Are you going for a walk? Yes. Isn’t the young green beautiful? So beautiful—quite burning. Good morning—good morning—you’ll come and see me?—thank you so much—next week—yes—good-bye, g-o-o-d b-y-e.’
“你好，”赫敏一能发出自己的声音，就在场外唱道。 ‘现在很好。你要去散步吗？是的。年轻的绿色不是很漂亮吗？如此美丽——相当燃烧。早上好——早上好——你会来看我吗？——非常感谢你——下周——是的——再见，再见，再见。

Gudrun and Ursula stood and watched her slowly waving her head up and down, and waving her hand slowly in dismissal, smiling a strange affected smile, making a tall queer, frightening figure, with her heavy fair hair slipping to her eyes. Then they moved off, as if they had been dismissed like inferiors. The four women parted.
古德伦和乌苏拉站在那里，看着她慢慢地上下摇头，并慢慢地挥手表示不予理睬，脸上挂着一种奇怪的做作的微笑，形成一个高大、古怪、可怕的身材，浓密的金发滑落到眼睛上。然后他们就走开了，就好像他们像下等人一样被解雇了。四女分了手。

As soon as they had gone far enough, Ursula said, her cheeks burning,
当他们走得足够远时，乌苏拉说道，她的脸颊在燃烧：

‘I do think she’s impudent.’
“我确实认为她很无礼。”

‘Who, Hermione Roddice?’ asked Gudrun. ‘Why?’
“谁，赫敏·罗迪斯？”古德伦问。 '为什么？'

‘The way she treats one—impudence!’
“她对待别人的方式——厚颜无耻！”

‘Why, Ursula, what did you notice that was so impudent?’ asked Gudrun rather coldly.
“为什么，乌苏拉，你注意到什么如此无礼？”古珍冷冷地问道。

‘Her whole manner. Oh, It’s impossible, the way she tries to bully one. Pure bullying. She’s an impudent woman. ‘You’ll come and see me,’ as if we should be falling over ourselves for the privilege.’
“她的整个举止。哦，这是不可能的，她想欺负一个人。纯粹的欺凌。她是个无礼的女人。 ‘你会来看我的’，好像我们应该为这个特权而奋不顾身。”

‘I can’t understand, Ursula, what you are so much put out about,’ said Gudrun, in some exasperation. ‘One knows those women are impudent—these free women who have emancipated themselves from the aristocracy.’
“我不明白，乌苏拉，你为什么这么生气，”古德伦有些恼怒地说。 “人们知道这些女性是无礼的——这些从贵族统治中解放出来的自由女性。”

‘But it is so UNNECESSARY—so vulgar,’ cried Ursula.
“但这太没有必要了——太粗俗了，”乌苏拉喊道。

‘No, I don’t see it. And if I did—pour moi, elle n’existe pas. I don’t grant her the power to be impudent to me.’
‘不，我没看到。如果我这么做了——pour moi, elle n’existe pas。我不授予她对我无礼的权力。

‘Do you think she likes you?’ asked Ursula.
“你认为她喜欢你吗？”乌苏拉问。

‘Well, no, I shouldn’t think she did.’
“嗯，不，我不应该认为她这么做了。”

‘Then why does she ask you to go to Breadalby and stay with her?’
“那她为什么要你去布雷多尔比和她住在一起？”

Gudrun lifted her shoulders in a low shrug.
古德伦低耸耸肩，抬起肩膀。

‘After all, she’s got the sense to know we’re not just the ordinary run,’ said Gudrun. ‘Whatever she is, she’s not a fool. And I’d rather have somebody I detested, than the ordinary woman who keeps to her own set. Hermione Roddice does risk herself in some respects.’
“毕竟，她知道我们不仅仅是普通的跑步者，”古德伦说。 ‘不管她是什么，她都不是傻子。我宁愿有一个我讨厌的人，也不愿有一个墨守成规的普通女人。赫敏·罗迪斯确实在某些方面冒着风险。

Ursula pondered this for a time.
乌苏拉思考了一会儿。

‘I doubt it,’ she replied. ‘Really she risks nothing. I suppose we ought to admire her for knowing she CAN invite us—school teachers—and risk nothing.’
“我对此表示怀疑，”她回答道。 “她确实不冒任何风险。我想我们应该钦佩她，因为她知道她可以邀请我们——学校老师——而不用冒险。

‘Precisely!’ said Gudrun. ‘Think of the myriads of women that daren’t do it. She makes the most of her privileges—that’s something. I suppose, really, we should do the same, in her place.’
“正是如此！”古德伦说。 “想想有无数不敢这样做的女性。她充分利用了自己的特权——这就是了。我想，真的，我们应该代替她做同样的事情。

‘No,’ said Ursula. ‘No. It would bore me. I couldn’t spend my time playing her games. It’s infra dig.’
“不，”乌苏拉说。 '不。这会让我感到厌烦。我不能花时间玩她的游戏。这是基础设施挖掘。

The two sisters were like a pair of scissors, snipping off everything that came athwart them; or like a knife and a whetstone, the one sharpened against the other.
姐妹俩就像一把剪刀，把一切挡在她们身上的东西都剪掉了。或者像一把刀和一块磨刀石，一方磨利另一方。

‘Of course,’ cried Ursula suddenly, ‘she ought to thank her stars if we will go and see her. You are perfectly beautiful, a thousand times more beautiful than ever she is or was, and to my thinking, a thousand times more beautifully dressed, for she never looks fresh and natural, like a flower, always old, thought-out; and we ARE more intelligent than most people.’
“当然，”乌苏拉突然喊道，“如果我们愿意去看她，她应该感谢她的星星。你非常美丽，比现在或过去的她美丽一千倍，而且在我看来，你的衣着也漂亮一千倍，因为她看起来从来不清新自然，就像一朵花，总是老旧的、深思熟虑的；我们比大多数人更聪明。

‘Undoubtedly!’ said Gudrun.
“毫无疑问！”古德伦说。

‘And it ought to be admitted, simply,’ said Ursula.
“这应该被承认，简单地说，”乌苏拉说。

‘Certainly it ought,’ said Gudrun. ‘But you’ll find that the really chic thing is to be so absolutely ordinary, so perfectly commonplace and like the person in the street, that you really are a masterpiece of humanity, not the person in the street actually, but the artistic creation of her—‘
“当然应该，”古德伦说。但你会发现，真正别致的事情就是如此绝对平凡，如此完美平常，就像街上的人一样，你真的是人类的杰作，实际上不是街上的人，而是艺术创作她的——”

‘How awful!’ cried Ursula.
“太可怕了！”乌苏拉喊道。

‘Yes, Ursula, it IS awful, in most respects. You daren’t be anything that isn’t amazingly A TERRE, SO much A TERRE that it is the artistic creation of ordinariness.’
“是的，乌苏拉，从大多数方面来说，这都很糟糕。你不敢成为任何不令人惊叹的“土地”的东西，“土地”如此之大，以至于它是平凡的艺术创作。

‘It’s very dull to create oneself into nothing better,’ laughed Ursula.
乌苏拉笑着说：“把自己创造得再好不过了，这太无聊了。”

‘Very dull!’ retorted Gudrun. ‘Really Ursula, it is dull, that’s just the word. One longs to be high-flown, and make speeches like Corneille, after it.’
“非常无聊！”古德伦反驳道。 “真的，乌苏拉，这很无聊，就是这个词。人们渴望夸夸其谈，并像高乃依那样发表演讲。

Gudrun was becoming flushed and excited over her own cleverness.
古德伦为自己的聪明才智变得满脸通红和兴奋。

‘Strut,’ said Ursula. ‘One wants to strut, to be a swan among geese.’
“昂首阔步，”乌苏拉说。 “一个人想要昂首阔步，成为雁群中的天鹅。”

‘Exactly,’ cried Gudrun, ‘a swan among geese.’
“没错，”古德伦喊道，“鹅群中的天鹅。”

‘They are all so busy playing the ugly duckling,’ cried Ursula, with mocking laughter. ‘And I don’t feel a bit like a humble and pathetic ugly duckling. I do feel like a swan among geese—I can’t help it. They make one feel so. And I don’t care what THEY think of me. FE M’EN FICHE.’
“他们都忙着扮演丑小鸭，”乌苏拉带着嘲讽的笑声喊道。 “而且我一点也不觉得自己像一只卑微可怜的丑小鸭。我确实感觉自己像鹅群中的天鹅——我无法控制。他们让人有这样的感觉。我不在乎他们怎么看我。 FE M’EN FICHE。’

Gudrun looked up at Ursula with a queer, uncertain envy and dislike.
古德伦抬头看着乌苏拉，脸上带着一种奇怪的、不确定的嫉妒和厌恶。

‘Of course, the only thing to do is to despise them all—just all,’ she said.
“当然，唯一能做的就是鄙视他们所有人——只是全部，”她说。

The sisters went home again, to read and talk and work, and wait for Monday, for school. Ursula often wondered what else she waited for, besides the beginning and end of the school week, and the beginning and end of the holidays. This was a whole life! Sometimes she had periods of tight horror, when it seemed to her that her life would pass away, and be gone, without having been more than this. But she never really accepted it. Her spirit was active, her life like a shoot that is growing steadily, but which has not yet come above ground.
姐妹们又回家了，读书、聊天、工作，等待周一上学。乌苏拉经常想知道，除了学校周的开始和结束以及假期的开始和结束之外，她还等待什么。这就是一生！有时，她会感到一阵强烈的恐惧，她觉得自己的生命即将逝去，消失殆尽，但不会有更多的事情发生。但她从来没有真正接受过。她的精神是活跃的，她的生命就像一根正在稳步生长的嫩芽，但还没有露出地面。

CHAPTER V
第五章

IN THE TRAIN
在火车上

One day at this time Birkin was called to London. He was not very fixed in his abode. He had rooms in Nottingham, because his work lay chiefly in that town. But often he was in London, or in Oxford. He moved about a great deal, his life seemed uncertain, without any definite rhythm, any organic meaning.
有一天，伯金被叫到伦敦。他在自己的住处并不固定。他在诺丁汉有房间，因为他的工作主要在那个城镇。但他经常在伦敦或牛津。他经常搬家，他的生活似乎不稳定，没有任何明确的节奏，没有任何有机的意义。

On the platform of the railway station he saw Gerald Crich, reading a newspaper, and evidently waiting for the train. Birkin stood some distance off, among the people. It was against his instinct to approach anybody.
在火车站的月台上，他看到杰拉尔德·克里奇正在看报纸，显然是在等火车。伯金站在人群中，有一段距离。接近任何人都违反了他的本能。

From time to time, in a manner characteristic of him, Gerald lifted his head and looked round. Even though he was reading the newspaper closely, he must keep a watchful eye on his external surroundings. There seemed to be a dual consciousness running in him. He was thinking vigorously of something he read in the newspaper, and at the same time his eye ran over the surfaces of the life round him, and he missed nothing. Birkin, who was watching him, was irritated by his duality. He noticed too, that Gerald seemed always to be at bay against everybody, in spite of his queer, genial, social manner when roused.
杰拉德时不时地抬起头，以他特有的方式环顾四周。尽管他正在仔细地看报纸，但他也必须时刻注意着周围的环境。他身上似乎有双重意识在运转。他一边认真地思考着报纸上读到的内容，一边扫视着周围的生活，没有错过任何事情。伯金看着他，对他的双重性感到恼火。他还注意到，杰拉尔德似乎总是与每个人都格格不入，尽管他在被唤醒时表现出古怪、和蔼、社交的态度。

Now Birkin started violently at seeing this genial look flash on to Gerald’s face, at seeing Gerald approaching with hand outstretched.
现在，伯金看到杰拉德脸上闪现出这种和蔼可亲的表情，看到杰拉德伸出手走近，他猛地吃了一惊。

‘Hallo, Rupert, where are you going?’
“哈喽，鲁珀特，你要去哪里？”

‘London. So are you, I suppose.’
'伦敦。我想你也是。

‘Yes—‘
'是的-'

Gerald’s eyes went over Birkin’s face in curiosity.
杰拉尔德的目光好奇地扫过伯金的脸。

‘We’ll travel together if you like,’ he said.
“如果你愿意的话，我们可以一起旅行，”他说。

‘Don’t you usually go first?’ asked Birkin.
“通常不是你先走吗？”伯金问。

‘I can’t stand the crowd,’ replied Gerald. ‘But third’ll be all right. There’s a restaurant car, we can have some tea.’
“我受不了人群，”杰拉德回答道。 “但是第三个就可以了。有餐车，我们可以喝点茶。”

The two men looked at the station clock, having nothing further to say.
两人看着车站的时钟，没有再说什么。

‘What were you reading in the paper?’ Birkin asked.
“你在报纸上读到了什么？”伯金问。

Gerald looked at him quickly.
杰拉德飞快地看着他。

‘Isn’t it funny, what they DO put in the newspapers,’ he said. ‘Here are two leaders—‘ he held out his DAILY TELEGRAPH, ‘full of the ordinary newspaper cant—‘ he scanned the columns down—‘and then there’s this little—I dunno what you’d call it, essay, almost—appearing with the leaders, and saying there must arise a man who will give new values to things, give us new truths, a new attitude to life, or else we shall be a crumbling nothingness in a few years, a country in ruin—‘
“他们在报纸上登的东西不是很有趣吗？”他说。 “这里有两位领导人——”他拿出《每日电讯报》，“充满了普通报纸的废话——”他向下浏览了栏目——“然后就是这个小东西——我不知道你会怎么称呼它，文章，几乎——出现了与领导人交谈，并说必须出现一个人，他将赋予事物新的价值观，给我们新的真理，新的生活态度，否则我们将在几年内成为一个摇摇欲坠的虚无，一个毁灭的国家——”

‘I suppose that’s a bit of newspaper cant, as well,’ said Birkin.
“我想这也是报纸上的一些黑话，”伯金说。

‘It sounds as if the man meant it, and quite genuinely,’ said Gerald.
“听起来这个人是认真的，而且是真心实意的，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Give it to me,’ said Birkin, holding out his hand for the paper.
“把它给我，”伯金说，伸出手去拿那张纸。

The train came, and they went on board, sitting on either side a little table, by the window, in the restaurant car. Birkin glanced over his paper, then looked up at Gerald, who was waiting for him.
火车来了，他们上了车，坐在餐车里靠窗的两边一张小桌子上。伯金扫了一眼他的报纸，然后抬头看着正在等他的杰拉德。

‘I believe the man means it,’ he said, ‘as far as he means anything.’
“我相信这个人是认真的，”他说，“就他的意思而言。”

‘And do you think it’s true? Do you think we really want a new gospel?’ asked Gerald.
‘你认为这是真的吗？你认为我们真的想要一本新福音吗？”杰拉德问道。

Birkin shrugged his shoulders.
伯金耸耸肩。

‘I think the people who say they want a new religion are the last to accept anything new. They want novelty right enough. But to stare straight at this life that we’ve brought upon ourselves, and reject it, absolutely smash up the old idols of ourselves, that we sh’ll never do. You’ve got very badly to want to get rid of the old, before anything new will appear—even in the self.’
“我认为那些说想要一个新宗教的人是最后接受任何新事物的人。他们想要足够新奇的东西。但直视我们给自己带来的这种生活并拒绝它，绝对是粉碎我们自己的旧偶像，这是我们永远不会做的。在任何新事物出现之前，你都非常想摆脱旧事物——即使是在你的自我中。

Gerald watched him closely.
杰拉尔德仔细地看着他。

‘You think we ought to break up this life, just start and let fly?’ he asked.
“你认为我们应该结束这种生活，开始并放飞自我吗？”他问道。

‘This life. Yes I do. We’ve got to bust it completely, or shrivel inside it, as in a tight skin. For it won’t expand any more.’
'今生。是的，我愿意。我们必须把它彻底破坏，或者在里面枯萎，就像在紧绷的皮肤里一样。因为它不会再扩大了。

There was a queer little smile in Gerald’s eyes, a look of amusement, calm and curious.
杰拉尔德的眼里带着一丝奇怪的微笑，一种有趣、平静又好奇的表情。

‘And how do you propose to begin? I suppose you mean, reform the whole order of society?’ he asked.
‘那么你打算如何开始呢？我想你的意思是，改革整个社会秩序？”他问道。

Birkin had a slight, tense frown between the brows. He too was impatient of the conversation.
伯金的眉头微微皱起。他也对这次谈话感到不耐烦。

‘I don’t propose at all,’ he replied. ‘When we really want to go for something better, we shall smash the old. Until then, any sort of proposal, or making proposals, is no more than a tiresome game for self-important people.’
“我根本不求婚，”他回答道。 ‘当我们真的想要追求更好的东西时，我们就会打破旧的。在那之前，任何形式的求婚，或者提出求婚，对于自以为是的人来说都不过是一场令人厌烦的游戏。

The little smile began to die out of Gerald’s eyes, and he said, looking with a cool stare at Birkin:
杰拉德眼中的笑容开始消失，他冷冷地看着伯金说道：

‘So you really think things are very bad?’
“那么你真的认为事情很糟糕吗？”

‘Completely bad.’
“完全糟糕。”

The smile appeared again.
笑容又出现了。

‘In what way?’
“以什么方式？”

‘Every way,’ said Birkin. ‘We are such dreary liars. Our one idea is to lie to ourselves. We have an ideal of a perfect world, clean and straight and sufficient. So we cover the earth with foulness; life is a blotch of labour, like insects scurrying in filth, so that your collier can have a pianoforte in his parlour, and you can have a butler and a motor-car in your up-to-date house, and as a nation we can sport the Ritz, or the Empire, Gaby Deslys and the Sunday newspapers. It is very dreary.’
“各方面，”伯金说。 ‘我们真是可悲的骗子。我们的一个想法就是对自己撒谎。我们有一个完美世界的理想，干净、正直、充足。于是我们用污秽覆盖了大地；生活就是一堆劳动，就像昆虫在污秽中乱窜，所以你的煤矿工人的客厅里可以有一架钢琴，你的新房子里可以有一个管家和一辆汽车，作为一个国家，我们可以炫耀丽兹酒店、帝国酒店、盖比·德斯利斯和周日报纸。这是非常沉闷的。

Gerald took a little time to re-adjust himself after this tirade.
在这番长篇大论之后，杰拉德花了一点时间重新调整自己。

‘Would you have us live without houses—return to nature?’ he asked.
“你想让我们过上没有房子的生活——回归自然吗？”他问道。

‘I would have nothing at all. People only do what they want to do—and what they are capable of doing. If they were capable of anything else, there would be something else.’
‘我什么都不会拥有。人们只做他们想做的事以及他们有能力做的事。如果他们有能力做其他事情，那就会有其他事情。

Again Gerald pondered. He was not going to take offence at Birkin.
杰拉德再次沉思。他不会冒犯 Birkin。

‘Don’t you think the collier’s PIANOFORTE, as you call it, is a symbol for something very real, a real desire for something higher, in the collier’s life?’
“你不认为煤矿工人的PIANOFORTE，正如你所说的那样，是煤矿工人生活中非常真实的东西的象征，是对更高事物的真正渴望吗？”

‘Higher!’ cried Birkin. ‘Yes. Amazing heights of upright grandeur. It makes him so much higher in his neighbouring collier’s eyes. He sees himself reflected in the neighbouring opinion, like in a Brocken mist, several feet taller on the strength of the pianoforte, and he is satisfied. He lives for the sake of that Brocken spectre, the reflection of himself in the human opinion. You do the same. If you are of high importance to humanity you are of high importance to yourself. That is why you work so hard at the mines. If you can produce coal to cook five thousand dinners a day, you are five thousand times more important than if you cooked only your own dinner.’
“更高！”伯金喊道。 '是的。直立宏伟的惊人高度。这让他在邻居煤矿工人眼中的地位大大提高。他看到自己反映在周围的意见中，就像在布罗肯薄雾中一样，在钢琴的力量下高了几英尺，他很满意。他为布罗肯幽灵而活，这是他自己在人类观点中的反映。你做同样的事。如果你对人类非常重要，那么你对你自己也非常重要。这就是为什么你在矿井里如此努力工作。如果你每天能生产煤炭来做饭五千顿晚餐，那么你的重要性比你只自己做饭要重要五千倍。”

‘I suppose I am,’ laughed Gerald.
“我想是的，”杰拉德笑道。

‘Can’t you see,’ said Birkin, ‘that to help my neighbour to eat is no more than eating myself. ‘I eat, thou eatest, he eats, we eat, you eat, they eat’—and what then? Why should every man decline the whole verb. First person singular is enough for me.’
“你难道看不出来吗？”伯金说，“帮邻居吃饭无异于吃掉我自己。” “我吃，你吃，他吃，我们吃，你吃，他们吃”——然后呢？为什么每个人都应该拒绝整个动词。第一人称单数对我来说就足够了。

‘You’ve got to start with material things,’ said Gerald. Which statement Birkin ignored.
“你必须从物质开始，”杰拉德说。柏金忽略了这句话。

‘And we’ve got to live for SOMETHING, we’re not just cattle that can graze and have done with it,’ said Gerald.
杰拉尔德说：“我们必须为某些事情而活，我们不仅仅是可以吃草并已经厌倦了的牛。”

‘Tell me,’ said Birkin. ‘What do you live for?’
“告诉我，”伯金说。 '你活着为了什么？'

Gerald’s face went baffled.
杰拉尔德的表情变得困惑起来。

‘What do I live for?’ he repeated. ‘I suppose I live to work, to produce something, in so far as I am a purposive being. Apart from that, I live because I am living.’
“我活着是为了什么？”他重复道。 “我想我活着就是为了工作，为了生产一些东西，就我是一个有目的的存在而言。除此之外，我活着是因为我活着。”

‘And what’s your work? Getting so many more thousands of tons of coal out of the earth every day. And when we’ve got all the coal we want, and all the plush furniture, and pianofortes, and the rabbits are all stewed and eaten, and we’re all warm and our bellies are filled and we’re listening to the young lady performing on the pianoforte—what then? What then, when you’ve made a real fair start with your material things?’
‘那你的工作是什么？每天从地球上开采出数千吨煤炭。当我们得到了所有我们想要的煤炭，所有的毛绒家具，钢琴，还有兔子都被炖了吃掉，我们都温暖了，我们的肚子填饱了，我们正在听那位年轻女士的讲话在钢琴上演奏——然后呢？那么，当你在物质上有了一个真正公平的开始时，该怎么办呢？

Gerald sat laughing at the words and the mocking humour of the other man. But he was cogitating too.
杰拉尔德坐在那儿，被另一个人的话和嘲讽的幽默逗笑了。但他也在深思熟虑。

‘We haven’t got there yet,’ he replied. ‘A good many people are still waiting for the rabbit and the fire to cook it.’
“我们还没有到达那里，”他回答道。 “很多人还在等待兔子和火来煮它。”

‘So while you get the coal I must chase the rabbit?’ said Birkin, mocking at Gerald.
“那么，当你拿到煤炭时，我必须去追兔子？”伯金嘲笑杰拉德说道。

‘Something like that,’ said Gerald.
“类似的事，”杰拉尔德说。

Birkin watched him narrowly. He saw the perfect good-humoured callousness, even strange, glistening malice, in Gerald, glistening through the plausible ethics of productivity.
伯金仔细地看着他。他在杰拉尔德身上看到了完美的幽默冷酷，甚至是奇怪的、闪闪发光的恶意，在看似合理的生产力伦理中闪闪发光。

‘Gerald,’ he said, ‘I rather hate you.’
“杰拉尔德，”他说，“我相当恨你。”

‘I know you do,’ said Gerald. ‘Why do you?’
“我知道你会的，”杰拉尔德说。 '你为什么？'

Birkin mused inscrutably for some minutes.
伯金不可思议地沉思了几分钟。

‘I should like to know if you are conscious of hating me,’ he said at last. ‘Do you ever consciously detest me—hate me with mystic hate? There are odd moments when I hate you starrily.’
“我想知道你是否有意识地恨我，”他最后说道。 ‘你是否曾经有意识地憎恨我——以神秘的憎恨来憎恨我？有时候我会非常讨厌你。

Gerald was rather taken aback, even a little disconcerted. He did not quite know what to say.
杰拉德颇为吃惊，甚至有点不知所措。他不太知道该说什么。

‘I may, of course, hate you sometimes,’ he said. ‘But I’m not aware of it—never acutely aware of it, that is.’
“当然，有时我可能会恨你，”他说。 “但我没有意识到这一点——也就是说，从来没有敏锐地意识到这一点。”

‘So much the worse,’ said Birkin.
“更糟糕的是，”伯金说。

Gerald watched him with curious eyes. He could not quite make him out.
杰拉尔德用好奇的眼睛看着他。他不太明白他的意思。

‘So much the worse, is it?’ he repeated.
“更糟糕了，是吗？”他重复道。

There was a silence between the two men for some time, as the train ran on. In Birkin’s face was a little irritable tension, a sharp knitting of the brows, keen and difficult. Gerald watched him warily, carefully, rather calculatingly, for he could not decide what he was after.
火车继续前行，两人之间沉默了好一会儿。伯金的脸上有一点烦躁的紧张，眉头紧锁，敏锐而艰难。杰拉尔德警惕地、仔细地、颇为算计地看着他，因为他无法决定自己在追求什么。

Suddenly Birkin’s eyes looked straight and overpowering into those of the other man.
突然，伯金的眼睛直直地、充满力量地注视着​​另一个人的眼睛。

‘What do you think is the aim and object of your life, Gerald?’ he asked.
“杰拉德，你认为你人生的目的和目标是什么？”他问道。

Again Gerald was taken aback. He could not think what his friend was getting at. Was he poking fun, or not?
杰拉德再次大吃一惊。他无法想象他的朋友在说什么。他是在开玩笑吗？

‘At this moment, I couldn’t say off-hand,’ he replied, with faintly ironic humour.
“此时此刻，我不能即兴说，”他带着略带讽刺的幽默回答道。

‘Do you think love is the be-all and the end-all of life?’ Birkin asked, with direct, attentive seriousness.
“你认为爱情是生命的全部和终点吗？”伯金问道，语气直接而专注。

‘Of my own life?’ said Gerald.
“我自己的生活？”杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

There was a really puzzled pause.
有一个非常困惑的停顿。

‘I can’t say,’ said Gerald. ‘It hasn’t been, so far.’
“我不能说，”杰拉尔德说。 “到目前为止还没有。”

‘What has your life been, so far?’
“到目前为止，你的生活怎么样？”

‘Oh—finding out things for myself—and getting experiences—and making things GO.’
“哦——为自己找出事情——并获得经验——并使事情顺利进行。”

Birkin knitted his brows like sharply moulded steel.
伯金皱起了眉头，就像锋利的铸钢一样。

‘I find,’ he said, ‘that one needs some one REALLY pure single activity—I should call love a single pure activity. But I DON’T really love anybody—not now.’
“我发现，”他说，“一个人需要某种真正纯粹的单一活动——我应该称爱为一种单一的纯粹活动。”但我并不真正爱任何人——现在不是。

‘Have you ever really loved anybody?’ asked Gerald.
“你曾经真正爱过一个人吗？”杰拉德问。

‘Yes and no,’ replied Birkin.
“是的，也不是，”伯金回答道。

‘Not finally?’ said Gerald.
“最后不是吗？”杰拉尔德说。

‘Finally—finally—no,’ said Birkin.
“最后——最后——不，”伯金说。

‘Nor I,’ said Gerald.
“我也没有，”杰拉德说。

‘And do you want to?’ said Birkin.
“你愿意吗？”伯金说。

Gerald looked with a long, twinkling, almost sardonic look into the eyes of the other man.
杰拉尔德用一种长长的、闪烁的、近乎讽刺的目光看着另一个人的眼睛。

‘I don’t know,’ he said.
“我不知道，”他说。

‘I do—I want to love,’ said Birkin.
“我愿意——我想要爱，”伯金说。

‘You do?’
'你做？'

‘Yes. I want the finality of love.’
'是的。我想要爱情的终结。

‘The finality of love,’ repeated Gerald. And he waited for a moment.
“爱的终结，”杰拉德重复道。他等了一会儿。

‘Just one woman?’ he added. The evening light, flooding yellow along the fields, lit up Birkin’s face with a tense, abstract steadfastness. Gerald still could not make it out.
“只有一个女人？”他补充道。傍晚的灯光沿着田野泛滥成黄色，照亮了伯金的脸，一种紧张、抽象的坚定。杰拉尔德还是听不懂。

‘Yes, one woman,’ said Birkin.
“是的，一个女人，”伯金说。

But to Gerald it sounded as if he were insistent rather than confident.
但对杰拉尔德来说，他听起来似乎很坚持，而不是自信。

‘I don’t believe a woman, and nothing but a woman, will ever make my life,’ said Gerald.
杰拉尔德说：“我不相信一个女人，除了女人之外，别无他物，能够改变我的生活。”

‘Not the centre and core of it—the love between you and a woman?’ asked Birkin.
“不是它的中心和核心——你和女人之间的爱情？”伯金问道。

Gerald’s eyes narrowed with a queer dangerous smile as he watched the other man.
杰拉德眯起眼睛，带着一种奇怪而危险的微笑看着另一个人。

‘I never quite feel it that way,’ he said.
“我从来没有这样的感觉，”他说。

‘You don’t? Then wherein does life centre, for you?’
‘你不这么认为吗？那么，对你来说，生命的中心在哪里呢？

‘I don’t know—that’s what I want somebody to tell me. As far as I can make out, it doesn’t centre at all. It is artificially held TOGETHER by the social mechanism.’
“我不知道——这就是我希望有人告诉我的。据我所知，它根本不居中。它是通过社会机制人为地结合在一起的。

Birkin pondered as if he would crack something.
伯金沉思着，仿佛他要敲碎什么东西。

‘I know,’ he said, ‘it just doesn’t centre. The old ideals are dead as nails—nothing there. It seems to me there remains only this perfect union with a woman—sort of ultimate marriage—and there isn’t anything else.’
“我知道，”他说，“它只是不集中。”旧的理想已经死了——什么也没有了。在我看来，只剩下与女人的完美结合——某种终极婚姻——而没有其他的了。

‘And you mean if there isn’t the woman, there’s nothing?’ said Gerald.
“你的意思是，如果没有那个女人，就什么都没有了？”杰拉尔德说。

‘Pretty well that—seeing there’s no God.’
“很好——看来上帝并不存在。”

‘Then we’re hard put to it,’ said Gerald. And he turned to look out of the window at the flying, golden landscape.
“那我们就很难了，”杰拉德说。他转身看向窗外飞舞的金色风景。

Birkin could not help seeing how beautiful and soldierly his face was, with a certain courage to be indifferent.
伯金不禁看到他的脸是多么美丽和军人般，带着一定的淡然的勇气。

‘You think its heavy odds against us?’ said Birkin.
“你认为这对我们不利吗？”伯金说。

‘If we’ve got to make our life up out of a woman, one woman, woman only, yes, I do,’ said Gerald. ‘I don’t believe I shall ever make up MY life, at that rate.’
“如果我们的生活必须由一个女人组成，一个女人，一个女人，那么是的，我愿意，”杰拉尔德说。 “我不相信我能以这样的速度来弥补我的生活。”

Birkin watched him almost angrily.
伯金几乎愤怒地看着他。

‘You are a born unbeliever,’ he said.
“你是一个天生的不信者，”他说。

‘I only feel what I feel,’ said Gerald. And he looked again at Birkin almost sardonically, with his blue, manly, sharp-lighted eyes. Birkin’s eyes were at the moment full of anger. But swiftly they became troubled, doubtful, then full of a warm, rich affectionateness and laughter.
“我只感觉到我的感觉，”杰拉德说。他又用他那双充满男子气概、目光锐利的蓝色眼睛，近乎讽刺地看着伯金。伯金此刻的眼中充满了愤怒。但很快他们就变得烦恼、怀疑，然后充满了温暖、丰富的深情和笑声。

‘It troubles me very much, Gerald,’ he said, wrinkling his brows.
“这让我很困扰，杰拉德，”他皱着眉头说道。

‘I can see it does,’ said Gerald, uncovering his mouth in a manly, quick, soldierly laugh.
“我看得出来是这样的，”杰拉德说着，露出了嘴角，发出一种男子气概、快速、军人般的笑声。

Gerald was held unconsciously by the other man. He wanted to be near him, he wanted to be within his sphere of influence. There was something very congenial to him in Birkin. But yet, beyond this, he did not take much notice. He felt that he, himself, Gerald, had harder and more durable truths than any the other man knew. He felt himself older, more knowing. It was the quick-changing warmth and venality and brilliant warm utterance he loved in his friend. It was the rich play of words and quick interchange of feelings he enjoyed. The real content of the words he never really considered: he himself knew better.
杰拉德不知不觉地被另一个人抱住了。他想要靠近他，想要在他的势力范围之内。柏金包有一种非常适合他的东西。但除此之外，他并没有太在意。他觉得他自己，杰拉德，比任何其他人都拥有更艰难、更持久的真理。他觉得自己年纪更大了，更有见识了。他喜欢他朋友身上那种瞬息万变的热情和唯利是图，以及灿烂而温暖的话语。他喜欢的是丰富的文字游戏和快速的情感交流。他从未真正考虑过这句话的真正内容：他自己更清楚。

Birkin knew this. He knew that Gerald wanted to be FOND of him without taking him seriously. And this made him go hard and cold. As the train ran on, he sat looking at the land, and Gerald fell away, became as nothing to him.
伯金知道这一点。他知道杰拉德想要喜欢他，但又不想把他当回事。这让他变得冷酷无情。火车继续前行，他坐在那儿看着大地，杰拉德倒下了，对他来说什么也不是了。

Birkin looked at the land, at the evening, and was thinking: ‘Well, if mankind is destroyed, if our race is destroyed like Sodom, and there is this beautiful evening with the luminous land and trees, I am satisfied. That which informs it all is there, and can never be lost. After all, what is mankind but just one expression of the incomprehensible. And if mankind passes away, it will only mean that this particular expression is completed and done. That which is expressed, and that which is to be expressed, cannot be diminished. There it is, in the shining evening. Let mankind pass away—time it did. The creative utterances will not cease, they will only be there. Humanity doesn’t embody the utterance of the incomprehensible any more. Humanity is a dead letter. There will be a new embodiment, in a new way. Let humanity disappear as quick as possible.’
伯金在傍晚时看着这片土地，心想：“好吧，如果人类被毁灭了，如果我们的种族像所多玛一样被毁灭了，而有这个美丽的夜晚，有发光的土地和树木，我就满足了。”告诉一切的东西就在那里，永远不会丢失。毕竟，人类不过是不可理解的事物的一种表达而已。而如果人类消逝，也仅仅意味着这个特定的表达已经完成、完成了。已表达的内容和将要表达的内容都不能减少。就在那里，在光辉灿烂的夜晚。让人类消逝吧——时间已经过去了。创造性的话语不会停止，它们只会存在。人类不再体现难以理解的话语。人性是一纸空文。将会有一个新的体现，以一种新的方式。让人类尽快消失。”

Gerald interrupted him by asking,
杰拉德打断他的话，问道：

‘Where are you staying in London?’
“你住在伦敦哪里？”

Birkin looked up.
伯金抬起头。

‘With a man in Soho. I pay part of the rent of a flat, and stop there when I like.’
“和苏荷区的一个男人。”我支付部分公寓的租金，并在我愿意的时候停在那里。

‘Good idea—have a place more or less your own,’ said Gerald.
“好主意——有一个或多或少属于你自己的地方，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes. But I don’t care for it much. I’m tired of the people I am bound to find there.’
'是的。但我不太关心它。我厌倦了我一定会在那里找到的人。

‘What kind of people?’
“什么样的人？”

‘Art—music—London Bohemia—the most pettifogging calculating Bohemia that ever reckoned its pennies. But there are a few decent people, decent in some respects. They are really very thorough rejecters of the world—perhaps they live only in the gesture of rejection and negation—but negatively something, at any rate.’
“艺术——音乐——伦敦波西米亚——最精打细算、精打细算的波西米亚。但也有一些正派的人，在某些方面是正派的。他们确实是世界的彻底拒绝者——也许他们只是以拒绝和否定的姿态生活——但无论如何，他们都是消极的。

‘What are they?—painters, musicians?’
“他们是什么？——画家、音乐家？”

‘Painters, musicians, writers—hangers-on, models, advanced young people, anybody who is openly at outs with the conventions, and belongs to nowhere particularly. They are often young fellows down from the University, and girls who are living their own lives, as they say.’
“画家、音乐家、作家——随从、模特、先进的年轻人，任何公开反对传统、不属于任何地方的人。”正如他们所说，他们通常是大学里的年轻人，以及过着自己生活的女孩。

‘All loose?’ said Gerald.
“都松了？”杰拉尔德说。

Birkin could see his curiosity roused.
伯金看得出来他的好奇心被激发了。

‘In one way. Most bound, in another. For all their shockingness, all on one note.’
'以某种方式。大多数束缚，在另一个。尽管它们令人震惊，但都集中在一个音符上。

He looked at Gerald, and saw how his blue eyes were lit up with a little flame of curious desire. He saw too how good-looking he was. Gerald was attractive, his blood seemed fluid and electric. His blue eyes burned with a keen, yet cold light, there was a certain beauty, a beautiful passivity in all his body, his moulding.
他看着杰拉德，发现他的蓝眼睛里闪烁着一丝好奇的欲望火焰。他也看出了他的英俊。杰拉德很有吸引力，他的血液似乎流动着，充满了电流。他的蓝眼睛闪烁着锐利却又冰冷的光芒，他的全身、他的造型有一种美感，一种美丽的被动。

‘We might see something of each other—I am in London for two or three days,’ said Gerald.
“我们可能会见面——我在伦敦呆了两三天，”杰拉德说。

‘Yes,’ said Birkin, ‘I don’t want to go to the theatre, or the music hall—you’d better come round to the flat, and see what you can make of Halliday and his crowd.’
“是的，”伯金说，“我不想去剧院，也不想去音乐厅——你最好到公寓来，看看你能对哈利迪和他的追随者做些什么。”

‘Thanks—I should like to,’ laughed Gerald. ‘What are you doing tonight?’
“谢谢——我很愿意，”杰拉德笑道。 '你今晚做什么？'

‘I promised to meet Halliday at the Pompadour. It’s a bad place, but there is nowhere else.’
“我答应在蓬巴杜宫会见哈利迪。这是一个糟糕的地方，但没有其他地方了。”

‘Where is it?’ asked Gerald.
“它在哪儿？”杰拉尔德问。

‘Piccadilly Circus.’
'皮卡迪利马戏团。'

‘Oh yes—well, shall I come round there?’
“哦，是的——好吧，我可以去那里吗？”

‘By all means, it might amuse you.’
“无论如何，这可能会让你觉得有趣。”

The evening was falling. They had passed Bedford. Birkin watched the country, and was filled with a sort of hopelessness. He always felt this, on approaching London.
夜幕降临了。他们已经过了贝德福德。伯金看着这个国家，心中充满了一种绝望。当他接近伦敦时，他总是有这种感觉。

His dislike of mankind, of the mass of mankind, amounted almost to an illness.
他对人类、对人类大众的厌恶几乎等于一种疾病。

‘’Where the quiet coloured end of evening smiles Miles and miles—‘‘ he was murmuring to himself, like a man condemned to death. Gerald, who was very subtly alert, wary in all his senses, leaned forward and asked smilingly:
“傍晚那静谧而色彩斑斓的尽头微笑着一英里又一英里——”他自言自语，就像一个被判死刑的人。杰拉德的神情十分微妙，所有的感官都十分警惕，他倾身向前，微笑着问道：

‘What were you saying?’ Birkin glanced at him, laughed, and repeated:
“你说什么？”伯金看了他一眼，笑着重复道：

‘’Where the quiet coloured end of evening smiles, Miles and miles, Over pastures where the something something sheep Half asleep—‘‘
“傍晚那安静的彩色尽头微笑着，绵延数英里，在牧场上，有一些羊半睡着了——”

Gerald also looked now at the country. And Birkin, who, for some reason was now tired and dispirited, said to him:
杰拉德现在也把目光投向了这个国家。不知为何，伯金现在感到疲倦和沮丧，他对他说：

‘I always feel doomed when the train is running into London. I feel such a despair, so hopeless, as if it were the end of the world.’
“当火车驶入伦敦时，我总是感到注定要失败。我感到如此绝望、如此无望，就好像这是世界末日一样。”

‘Really!’ said Gerald. ‘And does the end of the world frighten you?’
“真的！”杰拉尔德说。 “世界末日让你害怕吗？”

Birkin lifted his shoulders in a slow shrug.
伯金缓缓耸耸肩，抬起肩膀。

‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘It does while it hangs imminent and doesn’t fall. But people give me a bad feeling—very bad.’
“我不知道，”他说。 “当它悬在空中并且不会掉落时，它就会这样做。”但人们给我一种不好的感觉——非常糟糕。”

There was a roused glad smile in Gerald’s eyes.
杰拉尔德的眼中露出了兴奋的微笑。

‘Do they?’ he said. And he watched the other man critically.
“是吗？”他说。他批判地看着另一个人。

In a few minutes the train was running through the disgrace of outspread London. Everybody in the carriage was on the alert, waiting to escape. At last they were under the huge arch of the station, in the tremendous shadow of the town. Birkin shut himself together—he was in now.
几分钟后，火车就穿过了伦敦的耻辱。车厢里的每个人都处于戒备状态，等待着逃跑。最后，他们来到了车站的巨大拱门下，在城镇的巨大阴影中。伯金把自己封闭起来——他现在已经进去了。

The two men went together in a taxi-cab.
两个人一起乘坐出租车。

‘Don’t you feel like one of the damned?’ asked Birkin, as they sat in a little, swiftly-running enclosure, and watched the hideous great street.
“你不觉得自己像个该死的人吗？”伯金问道，当时他们坐在一个小而快速的围场里，看着那条可怕的大街。

‘No,’ laughed Gerald.
“不，”杰拉德笑道。

‘It is real death,’ said Birkin.
“这是真正的死亡，”伯金说。

CHAPTER VI
第六章

CREME DE MENTHE
奶酪和薄荷

They met again in the cafe several hours later. Gerald went through the push doors into the large, lofty room where the faces and heads of the drinkers showed dimly through the haze of smoke, reflected more dimly, and repeated ad infinitum in the great mirrors on the walls, so that one seemed to enter a vague, dim world of shadowy drinkers humming within an atmosphere of blue tobacco smoke. There was, however, the red plush of the seats to give substance within the bubble of pleasure.
几个小时后，他们在咖啡馆再次见面。杰拉德穿过推门，走进那间高大的房间，那里的酒客们的脸和头在烟雾的薄雾中隐隐约约地显现出来，反射得更加模糊，在墙上的大镜子里不断地重复着，让人仿佛进入了房间。一个模糊、昏暗的世界，里面有阴暗的饮酒者，在蓝色烟草烟雾的气氛中嗡嗡作响。然而，红色的毛绒座椅为欢乐的泡沫提供了实质内容。

Gerald moved in his slow, observant, glistening-attentive motion down between the tables and the people whose shadowy faces looked up as he passed. He seemed to be entering in some strange element, passing into an illuminated new region, among a host of licentious souls. He was pleased, and entertained. He looked over all the dim, evanescent, strangely illuminated faces that bent across the tables. Then he saw Birkin rise and signal to him.
杰拉尔德以缓慢、敏锐、专注的动作在桌子和人们之间移动，当他经过时，那些阴影般的面孔抬起头来。他似乎进入了某种奇怪的元素，进入了一个光明的新领域，置身于一群放荡的灵魂之中。他很高兴，也很开心。他环视桌子上所有昏暗、转瞬即逝、发出奇异光芒的面孔。然后他看到伯金站起来并向他示意。

At Birkin’s table was a girl with dark, soft, fluffy hair cut short in the artist fashion, hanging level and full almost like the Egyptian princess’s. She was small and delicately made, with warm colouring and large, dark hostile eyes. There was a delicacy, almost a beauty in all her form, and at the same time a certain attractive grossness of spirit, that made a little spark leap instantly alight in Gerald’s eyes.
柏金桌旁坐着一位女孩，她一头乌黑、柔软、蓬松的头发被剪成了艺术家风格的短发，水平垂下，饱满得几乎就像埃及公主的头发一样。她身材娇小，身材精致，肤色温暖，一双又大又黑的充满敌意的眼睛。她的整个身材有一种精致，几乎是一种美丽，同时还有一种令人着迷的粗犷精神，这让杰拉尔德的眼睛里立刻燃起了一点火花。

Birkin, who looked muted, unreal, his presence left out, introduced her as Miss Darrington. She gave her hand with a sudden, unwilling movement, looking all the while at Gerald with a dark, exposed stare. A glow came over him as he sat down.
伯金看上去沉默寡言、不真实，他的存在被忽视了，他介绍她为达林顿小姐。她突然、不情愿地伸出了手，同时用一种阴暗、暴露的眼神看着杰拉德。当他坐下时，一道光芒笼罩着他。

The waiter appeared. Gerald glanced at the glasses of the other two. Birkin was drinking something green, Miss Darrington had a small liqueur glass that was empty save for a tiny drop.
服务员出现了。杰拉尔德看了一眼另外两人的眼镜。伯金正在喝一些绿色的东西，达林顿小姐有一个小利口酒杯，除了一小滴之外，里面已经空了。

‘Won’t you have some more—?’
“你不想再来一些吗？”

‘Brandy,’ she said, sipping her last drop and putting down the glass. The waiter disappeared.
“白兰地，”她说，喝完最后一滴，放下酒杯。服务员消失了。

‘No,’ she said to Birkin. ‘He doesn’t know I’m back. He’ll be terrified when he sees me here.’
“不，”她对伯金说。 ‘他不知道我回来了。当他看到我在这里时，他会感到害怕。

She spoke her r’s like w’s, lisping with a slightly babyish pronunciation which was at once affected and true to her character. Her voice was dull and toneless.
她说r的时候就像w一样，口齿不清，发音有点幼稚，既做作又真实地符合她的性格。她的声音平淡无味。

‘Where is he then?’ asked Birkin.
“那么他在哪里？”伯金问道。

‘He’s doing a private show at Lady Snellgrove’s,’ said the girl. ‘Warens is there too.’
“他正在斯内尔格罗夫夫人家进行私人表演，”女孩说。 “瓦伦斯也在那儿。”

There was a pause.
一阵停顿。

‘Well, then,’ said Birkin, in a dispassionate protective manner, ‘what do you intend to do?’
“那么，”伯金以一种冷静的保护态度说道，“你打算做什么？”

The girl paused sullenly. She hated the question.
少女阴沉地停了下来。她讨厌这个问题。

‘I don’t intend to do anything,’ she replied. ‘I shall look for some sittings tomorrow.’
“我不想做任何事，”她回答道。 “明天我会找一些座位。”

‘Who shall you go to?’ asked Birkin.
“你要去见谁？”伯金问。

‘I shall go to Bentley’s first. But I believe he’s angwy with me for running away.’
“我先去宾利店。但我相信他对我逃跑感到愤怒。”

‘That is from the Madonna?’
“那是圣母玛利亚写的吗？”

‘Yes. And then if he doesn’t want me, I know I can get work with Carmarthen.’
'是的。如果他不需要我，我知道我可以在卡马森找到工作。

‘Carmarthen?’
“卡马森？”

‘Lord Carmarthen—he does photographs.’
“卡马森勋爵——他拍照片。”

‘Chiffon and shoulders—‘
“雪纺和肩部——”

‘Yes. But he’s awfully decent.’ There was a pause.
'是的。但他非常正派。” 停顿了一下。

‘And what are you going to do about Julius?’ he asked.
“那你打算怎么处理朱利叶斯呢？”他问道。

‘Nothing,’ she said. ‘I shall just ignore him.’
“没什么，”她说。 “我就不理他了。”

‘You’ve done with him altogether?’ But she turned aside her face sullenly, and did not answer the question.
“你已经和他彻底断绝关系了吗？”但她阴沉着脸，没有回答这个问题。

Another young man came hurrying up to the table.
另一个年轻人快步走到桌边。

‘Hallo Birkin! Hallo PUSSUM, when did you come back?’ he said eagerly.
“你好伯金！你好，PUSSUM，你什么时候回来的？”他急切地说。

‘Today.’
'今天​​。'

‘Does Halliday know?’
“哈利迪知道吗？”

‘I don’t know. I don’t care either.’
'我不知道。我也不在乎。

‘Ha-ha! The wind still sits in that quarter, does it? Do you mind if I come over to this table?’
'哈哈！风仍然停留在那个季度，是吗？你介意我过来这张桌子吗？

‘I’m talking to Wupert, do you mind?’ she replied, coolly and yet appealingly, like a child.
“我正在和伍珀特说话，你介意吗？”她回答道，语气冷静，但又充满吸引力，就像个孩子。

‘Open confession—good for the soul, eh?’ said the young man. ‘Well, so long.’
“公开忏悔——对灵魂有好处，是吗？”年轻人说。 “好吧，就这样吧。”

And giving a sharp look at Birkin and at Gerald, the young man moved off, with a swing of his coat skirts.
年轻人锐利地看了伯金和杰拉德一眼，然后甩动外套裙子就走开了。

All this time Gerald had been completely ignored. And yet he felt that the girl was physically aware of his proximity. He waited, listened, and tried to piece together the conversation.
一直以来，杰拉德都被完全忽视了。但他感觉那个女孩在身体上意识到了他的接近。他等待、倾听，并试图将谈话内容拼凑起来。

‘Are you staying at the flat?’ the girl asked, of Birkin.
“你住在公寓里吗？”女孩问伯金。

‘For three days,’ replied Birkin. ‘And you?’
“三天，”伯金回答道。 '你呢？'

‘I don’t know yet. I can always go to Bertha’s.’ There was a silence.
“我还不知道。”我可以随时去伯莎家。” 一阵沉默。

Suddenly the girl turned to Gerald, and said, in a rather formal, polite voice, with the distant manner of a woman who accepts her position as a social inferior, yet assumes intimate CAMARADERIE with the male she addresses:
突然，女孩转向杰拉尔德，用一种相当正式、礼貌的声音说道，带着一种女人的冷漠态度，她接受自己作为社会下等人的地位，但又与她所称呼的男性保持着亲密的友情：

‘Do you know London well?’
“你很了解伦敦吗？”

‘I can hardly say,’ he laughed. ‘I’ve been up a good many times, but I was never in this place before.’
“我很难说，”他笑道。 “我已经起来很多次了，但我以前从来没有来过这个地方。”

‘You’re not an artist, then?’ she said, in a tone that placed him an outsider.
“那么你就不是艺术家了？”她的语气让他觉得自己是个局外人。

‘No,’ he replied.
“不，”他回答道。

‘He’s a soldier, and an explorer, and a Napoleon of industry,’ said Birkin, giving Gerald his credentials for Bohemia.
“他是一名士兵，也是一名探险家，也是工业界的拿破仑，”伯金说道，同时向杰拉尔德授予了他在波西米亚的资格。

‘Are you a soldier?’ asked the girl, with a cold yet lively curiosity.
“你是军人吗？”女孩带着冷漠而活泼的好奇心问道。

‘No, I resigned my commission,’ said Gerald, ‘some years ago.’
“不，我几年前就辞去了职务，”杰拉尔德说。

‘He was in the last war,’ said Birkin.
“他参加了上一场战争，”伯金说。

‘Were you really?’ said the girl.
“你真的是这样吗？”女孩问道。

‘And then he explored the Amazon,’ said Birkin, ‘and now he is ruling over coal-mines.’
“然后他探索了亚马逊，”伯金说，“现在他正在统治煤矿。”

The girl looked at Gerald with steady, calm curiosity. He laughed, hearing himself described. He felt proud too, full of male strength. His blue, keen eyes were lit up with laughter, his ruddy face, with its sharp fair hair, was full of satisfaction, and glowing with life. He piqued her.
女孩用坚定而冷静的好奇心看着杰拉德。听到自己的描述，他笑了。他也感到自豪，充满了男性的力量。他那双锐利的蓝色眼睛里闪烁着笑意，红润的脸庞，一头锋利的金发，充满了满足，焕发着生命的光芒。他激怒了她。

‘How long are you staying?’ she asked him.
“你要待多久？”她问他。

‘A day or two,’ he replied. ‘But there is no particular hurry.’
“一两天，”他回答道。 “但并不特别着急。”

Still she stared into his face with that slow, full gaze which was so curious and so exciting to him. He was acutely and delightfully conscious of himself, of his own attractiveness. He felt full of strength, able to give off a sort of electric power. And he was aware of her dark, hot-looking eyes upon him. She had beautiful eyes, dark, fully-opened, hot, naked in their looking at him. And on them there seemed to float a film of disintegration, a sort of misery and sullenness, like oil on water. She wore no hat in the heated cafe, her loose, simple jumper was strung on a string round her neck. But it was made of rich peach-coloured crepe-de-chine, that hung heavily and softly from her young throat and her slender wrists. Her appearance was simple and complete, really beautiful, because of her regularity and form, her soft dark hair falling full and level on either side of her head, her straight, small, softened features, Egyptian in the slight fulness of their curves, her slender neck and the simple, rich-coloured smock hanging on her slender shoulders. She was very still, almost null, in her manner, apart and watchful.
她仍然用那种缓慢而专注的目光凝视着他的脸，这对他来说是那么好奇，那么令人兴奋。他敏锐而愉快地意识到自己，意识到自己的吸引力。他感觉浑身充满了力量，能够散发出一种电力般的力量。他注意到她那双漆黑而炽热的眼睛正注视着他。她有一双美丽的眼睛，黑色的，完全睁开，炽热，赤裸地看着他。他们身上似乎漂浮着一层瓦解的薄膜，一种痛苦和阴郁，就像水上的油。在炎热的咖啡馆里，她没有戴帽子，宽松简单的毛衣用一根绳子挂在脖子上。但它是用浓郁的桃色双绉制成的，沉重而柔软地挂在她年轻的喉咙和纤细的手腕上。她的外表简​​单而完整，非常美丽，因为她的规则和形状，她柔软的黑发丰盈而水平地垂落在头的两侧，她笔直、小巧、柔和的五官，埃及人的曲线略显丰满，她的修长的脖子，修长的肩膀上挂着一件简单、色彩丰富的罩衫。她一动不动，几乎毫无动静，她的举止显得疏远而警惕。

She appealed to Gerald strongly. He felt an awful, enjoyable power over her, an instinctive cherishing very near to cruelty. For she was a victim. He felt that she was in his power, and he was generous. The electricity was turgid and voluptuously rich, in his limbs. He would be able to destroy her utterly in the strength of his discharge. But she was waiting in her separation, given.
她强烈呼吁杰拉德。他感到她身上有一种可怕而令人愉悦的力量，一种近乎残忍的本能。因为她是受害者。他觉得她在他的权力之下，而且他很慷慨。他的四肢里充满了电流，令人欲罢不能。他的力量足以将她彻底摧毁。但她在分离中等待着。

They talked banalities for some time. Suddenly Birkin said:
他们聊了一会儿陈词滥调。伯金突然说道：

‘There’s Julius!’ and he half rose to his feet, motioning to the newcomer. The girl, with a curious, almost evil motion, looked round over her shoulder without moving her body. Gerald watched her dark, soft hair swing over her ears. He felt her watching intensely the man who was approaching, so he looked too. He saw a pale, full-built young man with rather long, solid fair hair hanging from under his black hat, moving cumbrously down the room, his face lit up with a smile at once naive and warm, and vapid. He approached towards Birkin, with a haste of welcome.
“朱利叶斯来了！”他半站起来，向新来者示意。女孩以一种奇怪的、近乎邪恶的动作，回头看了一眼，身体却一动不动。杰拉尔德看着她柔软的黑发垂在耳边。他感觉到她正专注地注视着那个走近的男人，于是他也看了过来。他看到一个面色苍白、身材魁梧的年轻人，一头长长的、坚实的金发从他的黑帽子下垂下来，笨拙地在房间里走来走去，他的脸上绽放出天真、温暖、乏味的笑容。他走向伯金，急忙表示欢迎。

It was not till he was quite close that he perceived the girl. He recoiled, went pale, and said, in a high squealing voice:
直到走近了，他才发现了这个女孩。他向后退了一步，脸色苍白，用尖锐的声音说道：

‘Pussum, what are YOU doing here?’
“普苏姆，你在这里做什么？”

The cafe looked up like animals when they hear a cry. Halliday hung motionless, an almost imbecile smile flickering palely on his face. The girl only stared at him with a black look in which flared an unfathomable hell of knowledge, and a certain impotence. She was limited by him.
听到哭声，咖啡馆就像动物一样抬起头来。哈利迪一动不动，脸上闪现出近乎愚蠢的苍白笑容。女孩只是用黑色的眼神看着他，眼神中闪烁着深不可测的知识地狱，还有某种无力感。她被他限制了。

‘Why have you come back?’ repeated Halliday, in the same high, hysterical voice. ‘I told you not to come back.’
“你为什么回来？”哈利迪用同样高亢、歇斯底里的声音重复道。 “我告诉过你不要回来。”

The girl did not answer, only stared in the same viscous, heavy fashion, straight at him, as he stood recoiled, as if for safety, against the next table.
女孩没有回答，只是以同样粘稠、沉重的方式直直地盯着他，而他则退缩着，靠在旁边的桌子上，仿佛是为了安全。

‘You know you wanted her to come back—come and sit down,’ said Birkin to him.
“你知道你想让她回来——过来坐下，”伯金对他说。

‘No I didn’t want her to come back, and I told her not to come back. What have you come for, Pussum?’
“不，我不想让她回来，我告诉她不要回来。你来干什么，普苏姆？

‘For nothing from YOU,’ she said in a heavy voice of resentment.
“你什么也得不到，”她用沉重的怨恨的声音说道。

‘Then why have you come back at ALL?’ cried Halliday, his voice rising to a kind of squeal.
“那你到底为什么回来？”哈利迪喊道，他的声音变得像尖叫。

‘She comes as she likes,’ said Birkin. ‘Are you going to sit down, or are you not?’
“她想来就来，”伯金说。 “你要坐下吗？”

‘No, I won’t sit down with Pussum,’ cried Halliday.
“不，我不会和普苏姆坐在一起，”哈利迪喊道。

‘I won’t hurt you, you needn’t be afraid,’ she said to him, very curtly, and yet with a sort of protectiveness towards him, in her voice.
“我不会伤害你，你不用害怕，”她对他说，语气非常简短，但声音里却带着一种对他的保护。

Halliday came and sat at the table, putting his hand on his heart, and crying:
哈利迪走过来，坐在桌边，把手放在心口上，哭道：

‘Oh, it’s given me such a turn! Pussum, I wish you wouldn’t do these things. Why did you come back?’
‘哦，这给了我这样的机会！ Pussum，我希望你不要做这些事情。你为什么回来？

‘Not for anything from you,’ she repeated.
“不是为了你的任何东西，”她重复道。

‘You’ve said that before,’ he cried in a high voice.
“你以前就说过了，”他大声喊道。

She turned completely away from him, to Gerald Crich, whose eyes were shining with a subtle amusement.
她完全转身离开他，转向杰拉尔德·克里奇，他的眼睛里闪烁着微妙的玩味。

‘Were you ever vewy much afwaid of the savages?’ she asked in her calm, dull childish voice.
“你曾经非常害怕野蛮人吗？”她用平静、呆板的孩子气的声音问道。

‘No—never very much afraid. On the whole they’re harmless—they’re not born yet, you can’t feel really afraid of them. You know you can manage them.’
“不——从来没有非常害怕。总的来说，它们是无害的——它们还没有出生，你不会真正害怕它们。你知道你可以管理它们。

‘Do you weally? Aren’t they very fierce?’
‘你还好吗？他们不是很凶猛吗？

‘Not very. There aren’t many fierce things, as a matter of fact. There aren’t many things, neither people nor animals, that have it in them to be really dangerous.’
'不是特别的。事实上，没有多少激烈的事情。没有多少东西，无论是人还是动物，都具有真正的危险性。”

‘Except in herds,’ interrupted Birkin.
“除了牛群，”伯金打断道。

‘Aren’t there really?’ she said. ‘Oh, I thought savages were all so dangerous, they’d have your life before you could look round.’
“真的没有吗？”她说。 “哦，我以为野蛮人都很危险，在你环顾四周之前他们就会夺走你的生命。”

‘Did you?’ he laughed. ‘They are over-rated, savages. They’re too much like other people, not exciting, after the first acquaintance.’
“是吗？”他笑道。 ‘他们被高估了，野蛮人。他们和其他人太像了，初次相识后并不令人兴奋。

‘Oh, it’s not so very wonderfully brave then, to be an explorer?’
“哦，那么成为一名探险家是不是非常勇敢呢？”

‘No. It’s more a question of hardships than of terrors.’
'不。这更多的是困难的问题，而不是恐惧的问题。

‘Oh! And weren’t you ever afraid?’
'哦！你从来没有害怕过吗？

‘In my life? I don’t know. Yes, I’m afraid of some things—of being shut up, locked up anywhere—or being fastened. I’m afraid of being bound hand and foot.’
'在我生命中？我不知道。是的，我害怕一些事情——害怕被关起来，锁在任何地方——或者被扣住。我害怕手脚被捆绑。

She looked at him steadily with her dark eyes, that rested on him and roused him so deeply, that it left his upper self quite calm. It was rather delicious, to feel her drawing his self-revelations from him, as from the very innermost dark marrow of his body. She wanted to know. And her dark eyes seemed to be looking through into his naked organism. He felt, she was compelled to him, she was fated to come into contact with him, must have the seeing him and knowing him. And this roused a curious exultance. Also he felt, she must relinquish herself into his hands, and be subject to him. She was so profane, slave-like, watching him, absorbed by him. It was not that she was interested in what he said; she was absorbed by his self-revelation, by HIM, she wanted the secret of him, the experience of his male being.
她用黑色的眼睛定定地看着他，那双眼睛落在他身上，深深地唤醒了他，让他的上半身非常平静。感觉她从他身上汲取自我启示，就像从他身体最深处的黑暗骨髓中汲取一样，这是相当美妙的。她想知道。她的黑眼睛似乎正在看穿他赤裸的身体。他觉得，她是被他逼迫的，她命中注定要和他接触，一定要见到他，认识他。这引起了一种奇怪的狂喜。他也觉得，她必须把自己交到他的手中，臣服于他。她是如此的亵渎，像奴隶一样，注视着他，被他吸引。并不是她对他说的话感兴趣；而是她对他说的话感兴趣。她被他的自我暴露所吸引，被他所吸引，她想要他的秘密，他的男性存在的经历。

Gerald’s face was lit up with an uncanny smile, full of light and rousedness, yet unconscious. He sat with his arms on the table, his sunbrowned, rather sinister hands, that were animal and yet very shapely and attractive, pushed forward towards her. And they fascinated her. And she knew, she watched her own fascination.
杰拉德的脸上绽放出不可思议的笑容，充满光明和兴奋，但却是无意识的。他坐着，双臂撑在桌子上，他那双晒黑的、相当阴险的手，像动物一样，但非常匀称和有吸引力，向前推向她。他们让她着迷。她知道，她看到了自己的魅力。

Other men had come to the table, to talk with Birkin and Halliday. Gerald said in a low voice, apart, to Pussum:
其他人也来到桌旁，与伯金和哈利迪交谈。杰拉尔德低声对普苏姆说道：

‘Where have you come back from?’
“你从哪里回来？”

‘From the country,’ replied Pussum, in a very low, yet fully resonant voice. Her face closed hard. Continually she glanced at Halliday, and then a black flare came over her eyes. The heavy, fair young man ignored her completely; he was really afraid of her. For some moments she would be unaware of Gerald. He had not conquered her yet.
“从乡下来的，”普苏姆回答道，声音很低，但却十分洪亮。她的脸紧紧地闭着。她不断地瞥向哈利迪，然后她的眼睛里闪现出黑色的光芒。那个身材魁梧、肤色白皙的年轻人完全不理睬她。他真的很怕她。有那么一会儿，她会意识不到杰拉尔德。他还没有征服她。

‘And what has Halliday to do with it?’ he asked, his voice still muted.
“哈利迪与这件事有什么关系？”他问道，声音依然低沉。

She would not answer for some seconds. Then she said, unwillingly:
她有几秒钟没有回答。然后她不情愿地说：

‘He made me go and live with him, and now he wants to throw me over. And yet he won’t let me go to anybody else. He wants me to live hidden in the country. And then he says I persecute him, that he can’t get rid of me.’
“他让我去和他住在一起，现在他想把我扔了。但他不会让我去找其他人。他要我隐秘地住在乡下。然后他说我迫害他，他无法摆脱我。

‘Doesn’t know his own mind,’ said Gerald.
“不知道自己的想法，”杰拉尔德说。

‘He hasn’t any mind, so he can’t know it,’ she said. ‘He waits for what somebody tells him to do. He never does anything he wants to do himself—because he doesn’t know what he wants. He’s a perfect baby.’
“他没有头脑，所以他不知道，”她说。 “他等待有人告诉他做什么。他从来不做任何他自己想做的事——因为他不知道自己想要什么。他是一个完美的婴儿。

Gerald looked at Halliday for some moments, watching the soft, rather degenerate face of the young man. Its very softness was an attraction; it was a soft, warm, corrupt nature, into which one might plunge with gratification.
杰拉德看了哈利迪一会儿，看着这个年轻人那张柔软而有些堕落的脸。它的柔软度非常吸引人。这是一种柔软、温暖、腐败的本性，人们可能会心满意足地投入其中。

‘But he has no hold over you, has he?’ Gerald asked.
“但他对你没有控制力，不是吗？”杰拉德问道。

‘You see he MADE me go and live with him, when I didn’t want to,’ she replied. ‘He came and cried to me, tears, you never saw so many, saying HE COULDN’T bear it unless I went back to him. And he wouldn’t go away, he would have stayed for ever. He made me go back. Then every time he behaves in this fashion. And now I’m going to have a baby, he wants to give me a hundred pounds and send me into the country, so that he would never see me nor hear of me again. But I’m not going to do it, after—‘
“你看，当我不愿意的时候，他让我去和他住在一起，”她回答道。 “他走过来向我哭泣，你从来没有见过这么多眼泪，说他无法忍受，除非我回到他身边。”他不会离开，他会永远留下来。他让我回去。然后每次他都是这样的表现。现在我要生孩子了，他想给我一百英镑，然后把我送到乡下，这样他就再也见不到我，也听不到我的消息了。但我不会那么做，之后——”

A queer look came over Gerald’s face.
杰拉尔德的脸上浮现出一种奇怪的表情。

‘Are you going to have a child?’ he asked incredulous. It seemed, to look at her, impossible, she was so young and so far in spirit from any child-bearing.
“你要生孩子吗？”他难以置信地问道。看着她，这似乎是不可能的，她那么年轻，精神上又那么远，根本不可能生孩子。

She looked full into his face, and her dark, inchoate eyes had now a furtive look, and a look of a knowledge of evil, dark and indomitable. A flame ran secretly to his heart.
她正视着他的脸，那双漆黑的、稚嫩的眼睛现在有了一种鬼鬼祟祟的神情，一种见识邪恶、阴暗而顽强的神情。一股火焰悄悄涌上他的心头。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘Isn’t it beastly?’
“是的，”她说。 “这不是很残忍吗？”

‘Don’t you want it?’ he asked.
“你不想要吗？”他问。

‘I don’t,’ she replied emphatically.
“我不喜欢，”她斩钉截铁地回答。

‘But—‘ he said, ‘how long have you known?’
“但是——”他说，“你知道多久了？”

‘Ten weeks,’ she said.
“十周，”她说。

All the time she kept her dark, inchoate eyes full upon him. He remained silent, thinking. Then, switching off and becoming cold, he asked, in a voice full of considerate kindness:
她始终用那双漆黑、稚嫩的眼睛注视着他。他沉默着，思考着。然后，他关掉电源，变得冰冷，用充满体贴善意的声音问道：

‘Is there anything we can eat here? Is there anything you would like?’
‘我们这里有什么可以吃的吗？有什么你想要的吗？

‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I should adore some oysters.’
“是的，”她说，“我应该喜欢一些牡蛎。”

‘All right,’ he said. ‘We’ll have oysters.’ And he beckoned to the waiter.
“好吧，”他说。 “我们要牡蛎。”他向服务员招手。

Halliday took no notice, until the little plate was set before her. Then suddenly he cried:
哈利迪没有注意到，直到小盘子被放在她面前。然后突然他哭了起来：

‘Pussum, you can’t eat oysters when you’re drinking brandy.’
“普苏姆，喝白兰地的时候不能吃牡蛎。”

‘What has it go to do with you?’ she asked.
“这和你有什么关系？”她问。

‘Nothing, nothing,’ he cried. ‘But you can’t eat oysters when you’re drinking brandy.’
“没什么，没什么，”他喊道。 “但是喝白兰地的时候就不能吃牡蛎了。”

‘I’m not drinking brandy,’ she replied, and she sprinkled the last drops of her liqueur over his face. He gave an odd squeal. She sat looking at him, as if indifferent.
“我不喝白兰地。”她回答道，然后把最后一滴利口酒洒在他脸上。他发出一声奇怪的尖叫。她坐在那儿看着他，一副漠不关心的样子。

‘Pussum, why do you do that?’ he cried in panic. He gave Gerald the impression that he was terrified of her, and that he loved his terror. He seemed to relish his own horror and hatred of her, turn it over and extract every flavour from it, in real panic. Gerald thought him a strange fool, and yet piquant.
“普苏姆，你为什么这么做？”他惊慌失措地喊道。他给杰拉尔德的印象是他害怕她，而且他喜欢这种恐惧。他似乎很享受自己对她的恐惧和仇恨，把它翻过来，从中提取出每一种味道，真正的恐慌。杰拉尔德认为他是个奇怪的傻瓜，但又很调皮。

‘But Pussum,’ said another man, in a very small, quick Eton voice, ‘you promised not to hurt him.’
“但是普苏姆，”另一个人用伊顿公学的小声、急促的声音说道，“你答应过不会伤害他的。”

‘I haven’t hurt him,’ she answered.
“我没有伤害他，”她回答道。

‘What will you drink?’ the young man asked. He was dark, and smooth-skinned, and full of a stealthy vigour.
“你要喝什么？”年轻人问道。他肤色黝黑，皮肤光滑，充满了隐秘的活力。

‘I don’t like porter, Maxim,’ she replied.
“我不喜欢波特，马克西姆，”她回答道。

‘You must ask for champagne,’ came the whispering, gentlemanly voice of the other.
“你必须要香槟。”对方低声说道，绅士的声音传来。

Gerald suddenly realised that this was a hint to him.
杰拉德突然意识到这是对他的暗示。

‘Shall we have champagne?’ he asked, laughing.
“我们要喝香槟吗？”他笑着问道。

‘Yes please, dwy,’ she lisped childishly.
“是的，拜托，dwy，”她孩子气地口齿不清地说。

Gerald watched her eating the oysters. She was delicate and finicking in her eating, her fingers were fine and seemed very sensitive in the tips, so she put her food apart with fine, small motions, she ate carefully, delicately. It pleased him very much to see her, and it irritated Birkin. They were all drinking champagne. Maxim, the prim young Russian with the smooth, warm-coloured face and black, oiled hair was the only one who seemed to be perfectly calm and sober. Birkin was white and abstract, unnatural, Gerald was smiling with a constant bright, amused, cold light in his eyes, leaning a little protectively towards the Pussum, who was very handsome, and soft, unfolded like some red lotus in dreadful flowering nakedness, vainglorious now, flushed with wine and with the excitement of men. Halliday looked foolish. One glass of wine was enough to make him drunk and giggling. Yet there was always a pleasant, warm naivete about him, that made him attractive.
杰拉德看着她吃牡蛎。她吃东西很精致，手指很细，指尖似乎很敏感，所以她把食物分开，动作很精细，吃得很仔细，很精致。见到她他很高兴，但伯金却很恼火。他们都在喝香槟。马克西姆，这个拘谨的俄罗斯年轻人，有着光滑、暖色的脸庞和涂油的黑色头发，是唯一一个看起来非常平静和清醒的人。伯金是白色的，抽象的，不自然的，杰拉德微笑着，眼睛里始终闪烁着明亮、有趣、冷酷的光芒，有点保护性地向小猫倾斜，小猫非常英俊，柔软，像一朵可怕的赤裸的红莲花一样展开，现在他很虚荣，因为酒和男人的兴奋而脸红。哈利迪看起来很愚蠢。一杯酒就足以让他醉得咯咯笑。然而他身上总有一种令人愉快、温暖的天真，这使他很有吸引力。

‘I’m not afwaid of anything except black-beetles,’ said the Pussum, looking up suddenly and staring with her black eyes, on which there seemed an unseeing film of flame, fully upon Gerald. He laughed dangerously, from the blood. Her childish speech caressed his nerves, and her burning, filmed eyes, turned now full upon him, oblivious of all her antecedents, gave him a sort of licence.
“除了黑甲虫，我什么都不怕。”小猫突然抬起头，用她的黑眼睛盯着杰拉德，眼睛里似乎有一层看不见的火焰。他笑得危险，笑声里带着血。她幼稚的言语抚摸着他的神经，她那双灼热的、被电影覆盖的眼睛现在全然转向他，忘记了她所有的过往，给了他一种许可。

‘I’m not,’ she protested. ‘I’m not afraid of other things. But black-beetles—ugh!’ she shuddered convulsively, as if the very thought were too much to bear.
“我不是，”她抗议道。 ‘我不害怕其他事情。但是黑甲虫——啊！”她痉挛般地颤抖着，仿佛这个想法就让她难以承受。

‘Do you mean,’ said Gerald, with the punctiliousness of a man who has been drinking, ‘that you are afraid of the sight of a black-beetle, or you are afraid of a black-beetle biting you, or doing you some harm?’
“你的意思是，”杰拉尔德用喝醉了的人的那种一丝不苟的语气说道，“你是害怕看到黑甲虫，还是害怕黑甲虫咬你，或者对你做点什么？”伤害？'

‘Do they bite?’ cried the girl.
“它们咬人吗？”女孩喊道。

‘How perfectly loathsome!’ exclaimed Halliday.
“真是太令人厌恶了！”哈利迪惊呼道。

‘I don’t know,’ replied Gerald, looking round the table. ‘Do black-beetles bite? But that isn’t the point. Are you afraid of their biting, or is it a metaphysical antipathy?’
“我不知道，”杰拉德环视桌子回答道。 “黑甲虫会咬人吗？但这不是重点。你害怕它们的咬人，还是一种形而上的反感？

The girl was looking full upon him all the time with inchoate eyes.
女孩一直用稚嫩的眼睛注视着他。

‘Oh, I think they’re beastly, they’re horrid,’ she cried. ‘If I see one, it gives me the creeps all over. If one were to crawl on me, I’m SURE I should die—I’m sure I should.’
“哦，我觉得它们很残忍，很可怕，”她哭道。 “如果我看到一个，我就会浑身毛骨悚然。如果有人爬到我身上，我确信我应该死——我确信我应该死。

‘I hope not,’ whispered the young Russian.
“我希望不会，”年轻的俄罗斯人低声说道。

‘I’m sure I should, Maxim,’ she asseverated.
“我确信我应该这样做，马克西姆，”她坚称。

‘Then one won’t crawl on you,’ said Gerald, smiling and knowing. In some strange way he understood her.
“这样就不会有人爬到你身上了，”杰拉德微笑着说道，他心知肚明。他以某种奇怪的方式理解了她。

‘It’s metaphysical, as Gerald says,’ Birkin stated.
“正如杰拉尔德所说，这是形而上学的，”伯金说。

There was a little pause of uneasiness.
一阵不安的停顿。

‘And are you afraid of nothing else, Pussum?’ asked the young Russian, in his quick, hushed, elegant manner.
“普苏姆，你什么都不怕吗？”年轻的俄罗斯人以他敏捷、安静、优雅的方式问道。

‘Not weally,’ she said. ‘I am afwaid of some things, but not weally the same. I’m not afwaid of BLOOD.’
“不太好，”她说。 “我害怕一些事情，但又不完全一样。我并不害怕血。

‘Not afwaid of blood!’ exclaimed a young man with a thick, pale, jeering face, who had just come to the table and was drinking whisky.
“不怕血！”一个脸色厚重、苍白、嘲讽的年轻人大声说道，他刚刚来到餐桌旁，正在喝威士忌。

The Pussum turned on him a sulky look of dislike, low and ugly.
小猫咪向他投去一脸厌恶的阴沉表情，卑鄙而丑陋。

‘Aren’t you really afraid of blud?’ the other persisted, a sneer all over his face.
“你真的不怕蓝光吗？”另一个人继续说道，脸上满是冷笑。

‘No, I’m not,’ she retorted.
“不，我不是，”她反驳道。

‘Why, have you ever seen blood, except in a dentist’s spittoon?’ jeered the young man.
“为什么，除了牙医痰盂里的血以外，你见过血吗？”年轻人嘲笑道。

‘I wasn’t speaking to you,’ she replied rather superbly.
“我不是在跟你说话，”她相当出色地回答道。

‘You can answer me, can’t you?’ he said.
“你可以回答我，不是吗？”他说。

For reply, she suddenly jabbed a knife across his thick, pale hand. He started up with a vulgar curse.
作为回答，她突然用刀刺过他粗壮苍白的手。他一开始就咒骂了一句粗俗的话。

‘Show’s what you are,’ said the Pussum in contempt.
“展示一下你的本质。”猫咪轻蔑地说。

‘Curse you,’ said the young man, standing by the table and looking down at her with acrid malevolence.
“诅咒你。”年轻人站在桌边，低头看着她，眼神尖酸刻薄。

‘Stop that,’ said Gerald, in quick, instinctive command.
“停下来，”杰拉德本能地快速说道。

The young man stood looking down at her with sardonic contempt, a cowed, self-conscious look on his thick, pale face. The blood began to flow from his hand.
年轻人站在那儿，低头看着她，脸上带着讽刺的轻蔑，厚重而苍白的脸上带着一种畏缩、不自在的表情。血开始从他的手上流出来。

‘Oh, how horrible, take it away!’ squealed Halliday, turning green and averting his face.
“哦，太可怕了，把它拿走！”哈利迪尖叫道，脸色变绿，转过脸去。

‘D’you feel ill?’ asked the sardonic young man, in some concern. ‘Do you feel ill, Julius? Garn, it’s nothing, man, don’t give her the pleasure of letting her think she’s performed a feat—don’t give her the satisfaction, man—it’s just what she wants.’
“你感觉不舒服吗？”讽刺的年轻人有些关切地问道。 “你不舒服吗，朱利叶斯？加恩，没什么，伙计，别给她带来让她认为自己完成了一项壮举的快乐——别给她满足感，伙计——这正是她想要的。

‘Oh!’ squealed Halliday.
“哦！”哈利迪尖叫道。

‘He’s going to cat, Maxim,’ said the Pussum warningly. The suave young Russian rose and took Halliday by the arm, leading him away. Birkin, white and diminished, looked on as if he were displeased. The wounded, sardonic young man moved away, ignoring his bleeding hand in the most conspicuous fashion.
“他要吃猫了，马克西姆，”小猫警告说。那个温文尔雅的年轻俄罗斯人站起来，抓住哈利迪的手臂，带他离开。柏金脸色苍白，身材瘦弱，他在一旁看着，好像很不高兴。受伤的、冷嘲热讽的年轻人走开了，以最引人注目的方式忽视了他流血的手。

‘He’s an awful coward, really,’ said the Pussum to Gerald. ‘He’s got such an influence over Julius.’
“他真的是个可怕的胆小鬼，”小猫对杰拉德说。 “他对朱利叶斯有如此大的影响力。”

‘Who is he?’ asked Gerald.
“他是谁？”杰拉尔德问。

‘He’s a Jew, really. I can’t bear him.’
“他确实是犹太人。我受不了他。

‘Well, he’s quite unimportant. But what’s wrong with Halliday?’
‘好吧，他根本不重要。但哈利迪怎么了？

‘Julius’s the most awful coward you’ve ever seen,’ she cried. ‘He always faints if I lift a knife—he’s tewwified of me.’
“朱利叶斯是你见过的最可怕的胆小鬼，”她喊道。 “如果我举起一把刀，他总是会晕倒——他对我很着迷。”

‘H’m!’ said Gerald.
“嗯！”杰拉尔德说。

‘They’re all afwaid of me,’ she said. ‘Only the Jew thinks he’s going to show his courage. But he’s the biggest coward of them all, really, because he’s afwaid what people will think about him—and Julius doesn’t care about that.’
“他们都害怕我，”她说。 “只有犹太人认为他会表现出勇气。但他确实是他们当中最大的胆小鬼，因为他担心人们会怎么想他——而朱利叶斯并不关心这一点。

‘They’ve a lot of valour between them,’ said Gerald good-humouredly.
“他们之间非常勇敢，”杰拉尔德幽默地说。

The Pussum looked at him with a slow, slow smile. She was very handsome, flushed, and confident in dreadful knowledge. Two little points of light glinted on Gerald’s eyes.
小猫看着他，缓缓地微笑着。她非常英俊，脸色红润，对可怕的知识充满信心。杰拉尔德的眼睛里闪烁着两个小光点。

‘Why do they call you Pussum, because you’re like a cat?’ he asked her.
“为什么他们叫你‘普苏姆’，因为你就像一只猫？”他问她。

‘I expect so,’ she said.
“我希望如此，”她说。

The smile grew more intense on his face.
他脸上的笑容越发浓郁了。

‘You are, rather; or a young, female panther.’
‘相反，你是；或者一只年轻的雌性黑豹。

‘Oh God, Gerald!’ said Birkin, in some disgust.
“天哪，杰拉尔德！”伯金有些厌恶地说。

They both looked uneasily at Birkin.
他们都不安地看着伯金。

‘You’re silent tonight, Wupert,’ she said to him, with a slight insolence, being safe with the other man.
“今晚你保持沉默，伍珀特，”她对他说，带着一点傲慢，与另一个男人在一起很安全。

Halliday was coming back, looking forlorn and sick.
哈利迪回来了，看上去孤独而病态。

‘Pussum,’ he said, ‘I wish you wouldn’t do these things—Oh!’ He sank in his chair with a groan.
“笨蛋，”他说，“我希望你不要做这些事——哦！”他呻吟着坐在椅子上。

‘You’d better go home,’ she said to him.
“你最好回家去，”她对他说。

‘I WILL go home,’ he said. ‘But won’t you all come along. Won’t you come round to the flat?’ he said to Gerald. ‘I should be so glad if you would. Do—that’ll be splendid. I say?’ He looked round for a waiter. ‘Get me a taxi.’ Then he groaned again. ‘Oh I do feel—perfectly ghastly! Pussum, you see what you do to me.’
“我要回家了，”他说。 ‘但是你们不都一起来吗？你不想来公寓吗？”他对杰拉尔德说。 ‘如果你愿意的话我会很高兴。这样做——那就太好了。我说？”他环顾四周寻找服务员。 “给我叫一辆出租车。”然后他又呻吟了一声。 “噢，我确实觉得——非常可怕！”普苏姆，你知道你对我做了什么。

‘Then why are you such an idiot?’ she said with sullen calm.
“那你为什么这么白痴？”她阴沉地平静地说。

‘But I’m not an idiot! Oh, how awful! Do come, everybody, it will be so splendid. Pussum, you are coming. What? Oh but you MUST come, yes, you must. What? Oh, my dear girl, don’t make a fuss now, I feel perfectly—Oh, it’s so ghastly—Ho!—er! Oh!’
‘但我不是白痴！哦，多糟糕啊！大家都来吧，一定会很精彩。普苏姆，你来了。什么？哦，但是你必须来，是的，你必须来。什么？哦，亲爱的姑娘，现在别大惊小怪了，我感觉很完美——哦，太可怕了——嗬！——呃！哦！'

‘You know you can’t drink,’ she said to him, coldly.
“你知道你不能喝酒，”她冷冷地对他说。

‘I tell you it isn’t drink—it’s your disgusting behaviour, Pussum, it’s nothing else. Oh, how awful! Libidnikov, do let us go.’
“我告诉你，这不是酒，而是你恶心的行为，普苏姆，不是别的。”哦，多糟糕啊！利比德尼科夫，让我们走吧。

‘He’s only drunk one glass—only one glass,’ came the rapid, hushed voice of the young Russian.
“他只喝了一杯——只喝了一杯。”年轻的俄罗斯人急促而低声说道。

They all moved off to the door. The girl kept near to Gerald, and seemed to be at one in her motion with him. He was aware of this, and filled with demon-satisfaction that his motion held good for two. He held her in the hollow of his will, and she was soft, secret, invisible in her stirring there.
他们都向门口走去。女孩离杰拉尔德很近，动作似乎与他心意相通。他意识到了这一点，并且对他的提议对两个人都有好处而充满了恶魔般的满足。他将她抱在自己的意志深处，而她在那儿的骚动是柔软的、秘密的、看不见的。

They crowded five of them into the taxi-cab. Halliday lurched in first, and dropped into his seat against the other window. Then the Pussum took her place, and Gerald sat next to her. They heard the young Russian giving orders to the driver, then they were all seated in the dark, crowded close together, Halliday groaning and leaning out of the window. They felt the swift, muffled motion of the car.
他们把五个人挤进了出租车。哈利迪踉踉跄跄地第一个坐进去，坐到靠着另一扇窗户的座位上。然后猫咪取代了她的位置，杰拉尔德坐在她旁边。他们听到年轻的俄罗斯人向司机发号施令，然后他们都坐在黑暗中，挤在一起，哈利迪呻吟着，把身子探出窗外。他们感觉到汽车快速而低沉的运动。

The Pussum sat near to Gerald, and she seemed to become soft, subtly to infuse herself into his bones, as if she were passing into him in a black, electric flow. Her being suffused into his veins like a magnetic darkness, and concentrated at the base of his spine like a fearful source of power. Meanwhile her voice sounded out reedy and nonchalant, as she talked indifferently with Birkin and with Maxim. Between her and Gerald was this silence and this black, electric comprehension in the darkness. Then she found his hand, and grasped it in her own firm, small clasp. It was so utterly dark, and yet such a naked statement, that rapid vibrations ran through his blood and over his brain, he was no longer responsible. Still her voice rang on like a bell, tinged with a tone of mockery. And as she swung her head, her fine mane of hair just swept his face, and all his nerves were on fire, as with a subtle friction of electricity. But the great centre of his force held steady, a magnificent pride to him, at the base of his spine.
猫咪坐在杰拉尔德身边，她似乎变得柔软，巧妙地将自己融入到他的骨头里，仿佛她正以一股黑色的电流进入他的体内。她的存在如同磁力般的黑暗弥漫在他的血管里，又像可怕的力量源泉一样集中在他的脊椎根部。与此同时，当她与伯金和马克西姆交谈时，她的声音听起来沙哑而漫不经心。她和杰拉尔德之间就是这种沉默和黑暗中那种黑色的、电击般的理解。然后她找到了他的手，用自己的小手紧紧地握住了它。天色如此漆黑，然而如此赤裸裸的陈述，让他的血液和大脑快速震动，他不再负有责任。她的声音依然如铃声般响起，带着一丝嘲讽的语气。而当她摇头的时候，她那细密的头发正好扫过他的脸，他所有的神经都着火了，就像有微妙的电流摩擦。但他力量的中心始终保持稳定，在他的脊柱底部，对他来说是一种巨大的骄傲。

They arrived at a large block of buildings, went up in a lift, and presently a door was being opened for them by a Hindu. Gerald looked in surprise, wondering if he were a gentleman, one of the Hindus down from Oxford, perhaps. But no, he was the man-servant.
他们到达了一大片建筑物，乘电梯上去，不久，一个印度教徒正在为他们打开一扇门。杰拉尔德看上去很惊讶，想知道他是否是一位绅士，也许是牛津的印度教徒之一。但不，他是男仆。

‘Make tea, Hasan,’ said Halliday.
“泡茶吧，哈桑，”哈利迪说。

‘There is a room for me?’ said Birkin.
“有我的房间吗？”伯金说。

To both of which questions the man grinned, and murmured.
对于这两个问题，男人咧嘴一笑，低声说道。

He made Gerald uncertain, because, being tall and slender and reticent, he looked like a gentleman.
他让杰拉尔德感到不确定，因为他身材高大、苗条、沉默寡言，看起来像一位绅士。

‘Who is your servant?’ he asked of Halliday. ‘He looks a swell.’
“谁是你的仆人？”他问哈利迪。 “他看起来很膨胀。”

‘Oh yes—that’s because he’s dressed in another man’s clothes. He’s anything but a swell, really. We found him in the road, starving. So I took him here, and another man gave him clothes. He’s anything but what he seems to be—his only advantage is that he can’t speak English and can’t understand it, so he’s perfectly safe.’
“哦，是的——那是因为他穿着另一个男人的衣服。他绝对不是一个膨胀者，真的。我们在路上发现了他，他正在挨饿。所以我把他带到这里，另一个人给了他衣服。他和他看起来的样子完全不一样——他唯一的优势是他不会说英语也听不懂，所以他非常安全。

‘He’s very dirty,’ said the young Russian swiftly and silently.
“他很脏。”年轻的俄罗斯人迅速而沉默地说道。

Directly, the man appeared in the doorway.
直接，男人就出现在了门口。

‘What is it?’ said Halliday.
“这是什么？”哈利迪问道。

The Hindu grinned, and murmured shyly:
印度教徒咧嘴一笑，害羞地低声说道：

‘Want to speak to master.’
“想和主人谈谈。”

Gerald watched curiously. The fellow in the doorway was goodlooking and clean-limbed, his bearing was calm, he looked elegant, aristocratic. Yet he was half a savage, grinning foolishly. Halliday went out into the corridor to speak with him.
杰拉德好奇地看着。门口的那人面容俊秀，四肢干净，神态沉稳，看上去优雅有贵族气息。但他却是半个野蛮人，傻笑着。哈利迪走到走廊里和他说话。

‘What?’ they heard his voice. ‘What? What do you say? Tell me again. What? Want money? Want MORE money? But what do you want money for?’ There was the confused sound of the Hindu’s talking, then Halliday appeared in the room, smiling also foolishly, and saying:
“什么？”他们听到了他的声音。 '什么？你怎么说？再说一遍。什么？要钱吗？想要更多钱吗？但你要钱做什么？

‘He says he wants money to buy underclothing. Can anybody lend me a shilling? Oh thanks, a shilling will do to buy all the underclothes he wants.’ He took the money from Gerald and went out into the passage again, where they heard him saying, ‘You can’t want more money, you had three and six yesterday. You mustn’t ask for any more. Bring the tea in quickly.’
“他说他想要钱买内衣。有人可以借我一先令吗？哦，谢谢，一先令就可以买他想要的所有内衣了。”他从杰拉德手里拿了钱，又走到走廊里，他们听到他说：“你不能想要更多的钱，你已经有三件和六件了。昨天。你不能再要求更多了。快点把茶端进来。”

Gerald looked round the room. It was an ordinary London sitting-room in a flat, evidently taken furnished, rather common and ugly. But there were several negro statues, wood-carvings from West Africa, strange and disturbing, the carved negroes looked almost like the foetus of a human being. One was a woman sitting naked in a strange posture, and looking tortured, her abdomen stuck out. The young Russian explained that she was sitting in child-birth, clutching the ends of the band that hung from her neck, one in each hand, so that she could bear down, and help labour. The strange, transfixed, rudimentary face of the woman again reminded Gerald of a foetus, it was also rather wonderful, conveying the suggestion of the extreme of physical sensation, beyond the limits of mental consciousness.
杰拉尔德环顾房间。这是一间普通的伦敦公寓里的客厅，家具显然很普通，而且很丑陋。但那里有几尊黑人雕像，来自西非的木雕，奇怪而令人不安，雕刻的黑人看起来几乎就像人类的胎儿。其中一名女子赤身裸体，以一种奇怪的姿势坐着，腹部突出，看上去饱受折磨。这位年轻的俄罗斯人解释说，她正坐着分娩，双手各抓着挂在脖子上的带子的两端，这样她就可以向下压，帮助分娩。女人那张奇怪的、呆呆的、简陋的脸再次让杰拉德想起了胎儿，而且还相当美妙，传达出超越精神意识极限的身体感觉的极端暗示。

‘Aren’t they rather obscene?’ he asked, disapproving.
“它们不是很淫秽吗？”他不以为然地问道。

‘I don’t know,’ murmured the other rapidly. ‘I have never defined the obscene. I think they are very good.’
“我不知道。”另一个人迅速低声说道。 “我从来没有给淫秽下过定义。我认为他们非常好。

Gerald turned away. There were one or two new pictures in the room, in the Futurist manner; there was a large piano. And these, with some ordinary London lodging-house furniture of the better sort, completed the whole.
杰拉尔德转身走开。房间里有一两张未来主义风格的新画；有一架大钢琴。这些，再加上一些普通的伦敦旅馆的更好的家具，完成了整体。

The Pussum had taken off her hat and coat, and was seated on the sofa. She was evidently quite at home in the house, but uncertain, suspended. She did not quite know her position. Her alliance for the time being was with Gerald, and she did not know how far this was admitted by any of the men. She was considering how she should carry off the situation. She was determined to have her experience. Now, at this eleventh hour, she was not to be baulked. Her face was flushed as with battle, her eye was brooding but inevitable.
猫咪脱下了帽子和外套，坐在沙发上。她显然在这所房子里很自在，但又犹豫不决，悬而未决。她不太清楚自己的立场。她暂时与杰拉尔德结盟，她不知道这些人在多大程度上承认了这一点。她正在考虑该如何应对这个局面。她决心要拥有自己的经验。现在，在这最后一刻，她不能被阻止。她的脸涨得通红，就像是在战斗，她的眼睛里充满沉思，但又无可避免。

The man came in with tea and a bottle of Kummel. He set the tray on a little table before the couch.
那人带着茶和一瓶库梅尔进来了。他把托盘放在沙发前的小桌子上。

‘Pussum,’ said Halliday, ‘pour out the tea.’
“普苏姆，”哈利迪说，“把茶倒出来。”

She did not move.
她没有动。

‘Won’t you do it?’ Halliday repeated, in a state of nervous apprehension.
“你不这么做吗？”哈利迪重复道，神情紧张而忧虑。

‘I’ve not come back here as it was before,’ she said. ‘I only came because the others wanted me to, not for your sake.’
“我没有像以前那样回到这里，”她说。 “我来只是因为其他人想让我来，不是为了你。”

‘My dear Pussum, you know you are your own mistress. I don’t want you to do anything but use the flat for your own convenience—you know it, I’ve told you so many times.’
“我亲爱的普苏姆，你知道你是你自己的情妇。我不想让你做任何事，只是为了你自己的方便而使用这套公寓——你知道的，我已经告诉过你很多次了。”

She did not reply, but silently, reservedly reached for the tea-pot. They all sat round and drank tea. Gerald could feel the electric connection between him and her so strongly, as she sat there quiet and withheld, that another set of conditions altogether had come to pass. Her silence and her immutability perplexed him. HOW was he going to come to her? And yet he felt it quite inevitable. He trusted completely to the current that held them. His perplexity was only superficial, new conditions reigned, the old were surpassed; here one did as one was possessed to do, no matter what it was.
她没有回答，只是默默地、保留地伸手去拿茶壶。大家围坐在一起喝茶。当她安静地坐在那里时，杰拉尔德能强烈地感觉到他和她之间的电击联系，以至于另一组情况完全发生了。她的沉默和不变让他感到困惑。他要怎么来找她？但他觉得这是不可避免的。他完全信任控制他们的潮流。他的困惑只是表面的，新的条件占据了主导地位，旧的条件被超越了。在这里，人们可以做自己想做的事，不管它是什么。

Birkin rose. It was nearly one o’clock.
柏金玫瑰。已经快一点了。

‘I’m going to bed,’ he said. ‘Gerald, I’ll ring you up in the morning at your place or you ring me up here.’
“我要去睡觉了，”他说。 “杰拉尔德，早上我会在你那里给你打电话，或者你在这里给我打电话。”

‘Right,’ said Gerald, and Birkin went out.
“好吧，”杰拉德说，伯金就出去了。

When he was well gone, Halliday said in a stimulated voice, to Gerald:
当他走远后，哈利迪用激动的声音对杰拉尔德说：

‘I say, won’t you stay here—oh do!’
“我说，你不留在这里吗——哦，留在这里吧！”

‘You can’t put everybody up,’ said Gerald.
“你不能让所有人都失望，”杰拉德说。

‘Oh but I can, perfectly—there are three more beds besides mine—do stay, won’t you. Everything is quite ready—there is always somebody here—I always put people up—I love having the house crowded.’
“哦，但是我可以，完全可以——除了我的床之外，还有三张床——留下来，好吗？一切都准备好了——这里总是有人——我总是安排人——我喜欢房子里挤满了人。

‘But there are only two rooms,’ said the Pussum, in a cold, hostile voice, ‘now Rupert’s here.’
“但是只有两个房间，”猫咪用冰冷而充满敌意的声音说道，“现在鲁珀特在这里。”

‘I know there are only two rooms,’ said Halliday, in his odd, high way of speaking. ‘But what does that matter?’
“我知道只有两个房间，”哈利迪用他奇怪而高调的说话方式说道。 “但这有什么关系呢？”

He was smiling rather foolishly, and he spoke eagerly, with an insinuating determination.
他笑得有些傻，语气急切，带着一种暗示的决心。

‘Julius and I will share one room,’ said the Russian in his discreet, precise voice. Halliday and he were friends since Eton.
“朱利叶斯和我将共用一个房间，”俄罗斯人用他谨慎而准确的声音说道。哈利迪和他从伊顿公学起就是朋友。

‘It’s very simple,’ said Gerald, rising and pressing back his arms, stretching himself. Then he went again to look at one of the pictures. Every one of his limbs was turgid with electric force, and his back was tense like a tiger’s, with slumbering fire. He was very proud.
“这很简单，”杰拉德说着，站起身来，向后压着双臂，伸了个懒腰。然后他又去看其中一张照片。他的四肢都充满了电力般的肿胀，背脊紧绷如猛虎，带着沉睡的火焰。他非常自豪。

The Pussum rose. She gave a black look at Halliday, black and deadly, which brought the rather foolishly pleased smile to that young man’s face. Then she went out of the room, with a cold good-night to them all generally.
普苏姆站了起来。她阴沉地看了哈利迪一眼，阴沉而死气沉沉，这让那个年轻人的脸上露出了相当愚蠢的高兴笑容。然后她走出房间，冷冷地向大家道晚安。

There was a brief interval, they heard a door close, then Maxim said, in his refined voice:
过了一会儿，他们听到门关上的声音，然后马克西姆用他优雅的声音说道：

‘That’s all right.’
'没关系。'

He looked significantly at Gerald, and said again, with a silent nod:
他意味深长地看了杰拉尔德一眼，默默地点了点头，再次说道：

‘That’s all right—you’re all right.’
“没关系——你没事的。”

Gerald looked at the smooth, ruddy, comely face, and at the strange, significant eyes, and it seemed as if the voice of the young Russian, so small and perfect, sounded in the blood rather than in the air.
杰拉尔德看着那张光滑、红润、俊美的脸，看着那双奇怪而意味深长的眼睛，这个年轻的俄罗斯人的声音，那么小而完美，听起来像是在血液中而不是在空气中。

‘I’M all right then,’ said Gerald.
“那我就没事了，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes! Yes! You’re all right,’ said the Russian.
'是的！是的！你没事吧，”俄罗斯人说。

Halliday continued to smile, and to say nothing.
哈利迪继续微笑，没有说话。

Suddenly the Pussum appeared again in the door, her small, childish face looking sullen and vindictive.
突然，猫咪又出现在门口，她那张稚嫩的小脸显得阴沉而充满斗气。

‘I know you want to catch me out,’ came her cold, rather resonant voice. ‘But I don’t care, I don’t care how much you catch me out.’
“我知道你想抓住我。”她冰冷而洪亮的声音传来。 “但我不在乎，我不在乎你有多少次让我出局。”

She turned and was gone again. She had been wearing a loose dressing-gown of purple silk, tied round her waist. She looked so small and childish and vulnerable, almost pitiful. And yet the black looks of her eyes made Gerald feel drowned in some potent darkness that almost frightened him.
她转身又走了。她穿着一件宽松的紫色丝绸晨衣，系在腰间。她看起来那么小、那么孩子气、那么脆弱，几乎可怜。然而她那双黑色的眼睛却让杰拉尔德感觉自己被某种强烈的黑暗淹没了，这几乎让他感到害怕。

The men lit another cigarette and talked casually.
男人们又点了一根烟，闲聊起来。

CHAPTER VII
第七章

FETISH
恋物癖

In the morning Gerald woke late. He had slept heavily. Pussum was still asleep, sleeping childishly and pathetically. There was something small and curled up and defenceless about her, that roused an unsatisfied flame of passion in the young man’s blood, a devouring avid pity. He looked at her again. But it would be too cruel to wake her. He subdued himself, and went away.
早上，杰拉德醒得很晚。他睡得很沉。普苏姆还在睡觉，睡得孩子气又可怜。她身上有一种渺小、蜷缩、毫无防备的感觉，在年轻人的血液中激起了一股无法满足的激情火焰，一种吞噬一切的强烈怜悯。他又看了她一眼。但叫醒她就太残忍了。他克制住了自己，然后就走了。

Hearing voices coming from the sitting-room, Halliday talking to Libidnikov, he went to the door and glanced in. He had on a silk wrap of a beautiful bluish colour, with an amethyst hem.
听到客厅里传来哈利迪和利比德尼科夫谈话的声音，他走到门口朝里看了一眼。他穿着一件美丽的蓝色丝质围巾，带有紫水晶下摆。

To his surprise he saw the two young men by the fire, stark naked. Halliday looked up, rather pleased.
令他惊讶的是，他看到火边的两个年轻人赤身裸体。哈利迪抬起头来，显得相当高兴。

‘Good-morning,’ he said. ‘Oh—did you want towels?’ And stark naked he went out into the hall, striding a strange, white figure between the unliving furniture. He came back with the towels, and took his former position, crouching seated before the fire on the fender.
“早上好，”他说。 “哦——你想要毛巾吗？”他赤裸着身子走进大厅，一个奇怪的白色身影跨过死气沉沉的家具。他拿着毛巾回来，回到原来的位置，蹲坐在挡泥板的火炉前。

‘Don’t you love to feel the fire on your skin?’ he said.
“你难道不喜欢感受皮肤上的火焰吗？”他说。

‘It IS rather pleasant,’ said Gerald.
“这相当令人愉快，”杰拉尔德说。

‘How perfectly splendid it must be to be in a climate where one could do without clothing altogether,’ said Halliday.
哈利迪说：“生活在一种可以完全不穿衣服的气候里，该是多么美妙啊。”

‘Yes,’ said Gerald, ‘if there weren’t so many things that sting and bite.’
“是的，”杰拉德说，“如果没有那么多会刺人、会咬人的东西的话。”

‘That’s a disadvantage,’ murmured Maxim.
“这是一个缺点，”马克西姆低声说道。

Gerald looked at him, and with a slight revulsion saw the human animal, golden skinned and bare, somehow humiliating. Halliday was different. He had a rather heavy, slack, broken beauty, white and firm. He was like a Christ in a Pieta. The animal was not there at all, only the heavy, broken beauty. And Gerald realised how Halliday’s eyes were beautiful too, so blue and warm and confused, broken also in their expression. The fireglow fell on his heavy, rather bowed shoulders, he sat slackly crouched on the fender, his face was uplifted, weak, perhaps slightly disintegrate, and yet with a moving beauty of its own.
杰拉尔德看着他，看到这个人类动物，金色的皮肤，赤裸的，有点令人感到羞辱。哈利迪则不同。他有一种相当沉重、松弛、破碎的美感，白皙而坚定。他就像圣母怜子图中的基督。动物根本不存在，只有沉重、破碎的美。杰拉尔德意识到哈利迪的眼睛也很美丽，那么蓝，那么温暖，那么困惑，表情也破碎。火光落在他沉重而弓形的肩膀上，他懒洋洋地蹲在挡泥板上，他的脸抬起来，虚弱，也许有点崩溃，但却有一种动人的美感。

‘Of course,’ said Maxim, ‘you’ve been in hot countries where the people go about naked.’
“当然，”马克西姆说，“你去过炎热的国家，人们都赤身裸体。”

‘Oh really!’ exclaimed Halliday. ‘Where?’
“哦，真的！”哈利迪惊呼道。 '在哪里？'

‘South America—Amazon,’ said Gerald.
“南美洲——亚马逊，”杰拉德说。

‘Oh but how perfectly splendid! It’s one of the things I want most to do—to live from day to day without EVER putting on any sort of clothing whatever. If I could do that, I should feel I had lived.’
‘噢，多么完美啊！这是我最想做的事情之一——日复一日地生活，不穿任何衣服。如果我能做到这一点，我就会觉得我还活着。”

‘But why?’ said Gerald. ‘I can’t see that it makes so much difference.’
“但是为什么呢？”杰拉尔德说。 “我看不出这有多大区别。”

‘Oh, I think it would be perfectly splendid. I’m sure life would be entirely another thing—entirely different, and perfectly wonderful.’
‘哦，我想那会非常精彩。我确信生活将完全是另一回事——完全不同，而且非常美妙。

‘But why?’ asked Gerald. ‘Why should it?’
“但是为什么呢？”杰拉德问道。 “为什么要这么做？”

‘Oh—one would FEEL things instead of merely looking at them. I should feel the air move against me, and feel the things I touched, instead of having only to look at them. I’m sure life is all wrong because it has become much too visual—we can neither hear nor feel nor understand, we can only see. I’m sure that is entirely wrong.’
‘哦——人们会感觉到事物，而不仅仅是看着它们。我应该感受空气在我身上流动，感受我触摸到的东西，而不仅仅是看着它们。我确信生活是错误的，因为它变得太视觉化了——我们听不到、感觉不到、理解不了，我们只能看到。我确信这是完全错误的。

‘Yes, that is true, that is true,’ said the Russian.
“是的，确实如此，确实如此，”俄罗斯人说道。

Gerald glanced at him, and saw him, his suave, golden coloured body with the black hair growing fine and freely, like tendrils, and his limbs like smooth plant-stems. He was so healthy and well-made, why did he make one ashamed, why did one feel repelled? Why should Gerald even dislike it, why did it seem to him to detract from his own dignity. Was that all a human being amounted to? So uninspired! thought Gerald.
杰拉尔德看了他一眼，看到了他温文尔雅的金色身体，黑色的头发细密而自由地生长，像卷须一样，四肢像光滑的植物茎。他身体这么健康，身材这么好，为什么让人感到羞耻，为什么让人感到排斥？杰拉尔德为什么会不喜欢它，为什么在他看来这有损于他自己的尊严。这就是人类的全部吗？太没有灵感了！杰拉尔德想。

Birkin suddenly appeared in the doorway, in white pyjamas and wet hair, and a towel over his arm. He was aloof and white, and somehow evanescent.
伯金突然出现在门口，穿着白色睡衣，头发湿漉漉的，胳膊上搭着一条毛巾。他冷漠而苍白，不知何故转瞬即逝。

‘There’s the bath-room now, if you want it,’ he said generally, and was going away again, when Gerald called:
“现在浴室就在这儿了，如果你想要的话，”他概括地说，然后又要离开，这时杰拉尔德喊道：

‘I say, Rupert!’
“我说，鲁珀特！”

‘What?’ The single white figure appeared again, a presence in the room.
“什么？”那个白色的身影再次出现，出现在房间里。

‘What do you think of that figure there? I want to know,’ Gerald asked.
‘你觉得那里的那个人像怎么样？我想知道，”杰拉德问道。

Birkin, white and strangely ghostly, went over to the carved figure of the negro woman in labour. Her nude, protuberant body crouched in a strange, clutching posture, her hands gripping the ends of the band, above her breast.
伯金，白色的，奇怪的幽灵般的，走向那个正在分娩的黑人妇女的雕刻人物。她赤裸、突出的身体以一种奇怪的、紧握的姿势蹲伏着，双手紧握着胸前带子的末端。

‘It is art,’ said Birkin.
“这是艺术，”伯金说。

‘Very beautiful, it’s very beautiful,’ said the Russian.
“非常漂亮，非常漂亮，”俄罗斯人说。

They all drew near to look. Gerald looked at the group of men, the Russian golden and like a water-plant, Halliday tall and heavily, brokenly beautiful, Birkin very white and indefinite, not to be assigned, as he looked closely at the carven woman. Strangely elated, Gerald also lifted his eyes to the face of the wooden figure. And his heart contracted.
他们都凑近来看。杰拉尔德看着这群男人，俄罗斯金色的，像一株水生植物，哈利迪又高又重，美得破碎，柏金包很白，不确定，不被分配，他仔细地看着雕刻的女人。奇怪的是，杰拉尔德也抬起头来，看向木人的脸。他的心也随之收缩。

He saw vividly with his spirit the grey, forward-stretching face of the negro woman, African and tense, abstracted in utter physical stress. It was a terrible face, void, peaked, abstracted almost into meaninglessness by the weight of sensation beneath. He saw the Pussum in it. As in a dream, he knew her.
他用精神生动地看到了黑人妇女那张灰色的、向前伸展的脸，非洲裔的、紧张的、在极度的身体压力下心不在焉的。那是一张可怕的脸，空虚，尖顶，被下面的感觉重压几乎变得毫无意义。他看到了里面的普苏姆。就像在梦里一样，他认识她。

‘Why is it art?’ Gerald asked, shocked, resentful.
“为什么它是艺术？”杰拉尔德问道，震惊而愤恨。

‘It conveys a complete truth,’ said Birkin. ‘It contains the whole truth of that state, whatever you feel about it.’
“它传达了一个完整的事实，”伯金说。 “它包含了那种状态的全部真相，无论你对此有何感受。”

‘But you can’t call it HIGH art,’ said Gerald.
“但你不能称其为高雅艺术，”杰拉尔德说。

‘High! There are centuries and hundreds of centuries of development in a straight line, behind that carving; it is an awful pitch of culture, of a definite sort.’
'高的！在那个雕刻的背后，有数百个世纪的直线发展；这是一种可怕的文化，某种意义上的。”

‘What culture?’ Gerald asked, in opposition. He hated the sheer African thing.
“什么文化？”杰拉德反问道。他讨厌纯粹的非洲事物。

‘Pure culture in sensation, culture in the physical consciousness, really ultimate PHYSICAL consciousness, mindless, utterly sensual. It is so sensual as to be final, supreme.’
‘感觉中的纯粹文化，身体意识中的文化，真正终极的身体意识，无意识的，完全感性的。它是如此感性，以至于是最终的、至高无上的。”

But Gerald resented it. He wanted to keep certain illusions, certain ideas like clothing.
但杰拉尔德对此表示不满。他想保留某些幻想、某些想法，比如服装。

‘You like the wrong things, Rupert,’ he said, ‘things against yourself.’
“你喜欢错误的东西，鲁珀特，”他说，“那些对你不利的东西。”

‘Oh, I know, this isn’t everything,’ Birkin replied, moving away.
“哦，我知道，这还不是全部，”伯金回答道，走开了。

When Gerald went back to his room from the bath, he also carried his clothes. He was so conventional at home, that when he was really away, and on the loose, as now, he enjoyed nothing so much as full outrageousness. So he strode with his blue silk wrap over his arm and felt defiant.
杰拉德洗完澡回到自己的房间时，还带着自己的衣服。他在家里是如此传统，以至于当他真正离开并逍遥法外时，就像现在一样，他最享受的就是完全的无礼。于是他手臂上裹着蓝色丝巾，大步流星地走着，充满了挑衅的感觉。

The Pussum lay in her bed, motionless, her round, dark eyes like black, unhappy pools. He could only see the black, bottomless pools of her eyes. Perhaps she suffered. The sensation of her inchoate suffering roused the old sharp flame in him, a mordant pity, a passion almost of cruelty.
小猫躺在床上，一动不动，圆圆的黑眼睛就像黑色的、忧郁的池塘。他只能看到她那双漆黑无底的眼眸。也许她受苦了。她的早期痛苦的感觉激起了他内心旧有的强烈火焰，一种尖刻的怜悯，一种近乎残酷的激情。

‘You are awake now,’ he said to her.
“你现在醒了，”他对她说。

‘What time is it?’ came her muted voice.
“现在几点了？”她低沉的声音传来。

She seemed to flow back, almost like liquid, from his approach, to sink helplessly away from him. Her inchoate look of a violated slave, whose fulfilment lies in her further and further violation, made his nerves quiver with acutely desirable sensation. After all, his was the only will, she was the passive substance of his will. He tingled with the subtle, biting sensation. And then he knew, he must go away from her, there must be pure separation between them.
她似乎像液体一样从他的靠近中流了回来，无助地从他身边沉下去。她早期的样子就像一个被侵犯的奴隶，她的满足在于她越来越多的侵犯，这让他的神经因强烈渴望的感觉而颤抖。毕竟，他是唯一的意志，她是他意志的被动实体。那种微妙的、刺痛的感觉让他感到刺痛。然后他知道，他必须离开她，他们之间必须有纯粹的分离。

It was a quiet and ordinary breakfast, the four men all looking very clean and bathed. Gerald and the Russian were both correct and COMME IL FAUT in appearance and manner, Birkin was gaunt and sick, and looked a failure in his attempt to be a properly dressed man, like Gerald and Maxim. Halliday wore tweeds and a green flannel shirt, and a rag of a tie, which was just right for him. The Hindu brought in a great deal of soft toast, and looked exactly the same as he had looked the night before, statically the same.
这是一顿​​安静而普通的早餐，四个人看上去都很干净，洗漱完毕。杰拉尔德和俄罗斯人都很正确，而且在外表和举止上都非常失败，伯金憔悴且病态，他试图成为一个像杰拉尔德和马克西姆那样穿着得体的人，看起来很失败。哈利迪穿着粗花呢和绿色法兰绒衬衫，打着一条破烂的领带，这很适合他。印度教徒带来了大量松软的吐司，看起来和前一天晚上一模一样，一模一样。

At the end of the breakfast the Pussum appeared, in a purple silk wrap with a shimmering sash. She had recovered herself somewhat, but was mute and lifeless still. It was a torment to her when anybody spoke to her. Her face was like a small, fine mask, sinister too, masked with unwilling suffering. It was almost midday. Gerald rose and went away to his business, glad to get out. But he had not finished. He was coming back again at evening, they were all dining together, and he had booked seats for the party, excepting Birkin, at a music-hall.
早餐结束时，小猫出现了，她裹着紫色丝绸，系着闪闪发光的腰带。她已经恢复了一些，但仍然沉默寡言，毫无生气。当有人跟她说话时，她感到很痛苦。她的脸就像一张精致的小面具，同样阴险，带着不甘的痛苦。时间已经快到中午了。杰拉尔德站起身去忙他的事，很高兴能出去。但他还没有说完。晚上他又回来了，他们都在一起吃饭，他在音乐厅预订了聚会的座位，除了伯金之外。

At night they came back to the flat very late again, again flushed with drink. Again the man-servant—who invariably disappeared between the hours of ten and twelve at night—came in silently and inscrutably with tea, bending in a slow, strange, leopard-like fashion to put the tray softly on the table. His face was immutable, aristocratic-looking, tinged slightly with grey under the skin; he was young and good-looking. But Birkin felt a slight sickness, looking at him, and feeling the slight greyness as an ash or a corruption, in the aristocratic inscrutability of expression a nauseating, bestial stupidity.
晚上，他们回到公寓已经很晚了，再次喝得满脸通红。男仆——总是在晚上十点到十二点之间消失——又端着茶，悄无声息、令人费解地进来，以一种缓慢、奇怪、豹子般的方式弯下腰，将托盘轻轻放在桌子上。他的脸一成不变，具有贵族气质，皮肤下略带灰色。他年轻又英俊。但伯金看着他，感到一种轻微的恶心，感觉那轻微的灰色像灰烬或腐败，在贵族般的难以理解的表情中是一种令人作呕的、野兽般的愚蠢。

Again they talked cordially and rousedly together. But already a certain friability was coming over the party, Birkin was mad with irritation, Halliday was turning in an insane hatred against Gerald, the Pussum was becoming hard and cold, like a flint knife, and Halliday was laying himself out to her. And her intention, ultimately, was to capture Halliday, to have complete power over him.
他们再次亲切而热情地交谈。但聚会上已经出现了某种脆弱的气氛，伯金气得发疯，哈利迪对杰拉德产生了疯狂的仇恨，小猫变得又硬又冷，像一把燧石刀，哈利迪向她倾诉自己。她的最终目的是抓住哈利迪，对他拥有完全的权力。

In the morning they all stalked and lounged about again. But Gerald could feel a strange hostility to himself, in the air. It roused his obstinacy, and he stood up against it. He hung on for two more days. The result was a nasty and insane scene with Halliday on the fourth evening. Halliday turned with absurd animosity upon Gerald, in the cafe. There was a row. Gerald was on the point of knocking-in Halliday’s face; when he was filled with sudden disgust and indifference, and he went away, leaving Halliday in a foolish state of gloating triumph, the Pussum hard and established, and Maxim standing clear. Birkin was absent, he had gone out of town again.
早上，他们又闲逛起来。但杰拉尔德能感觉到空气中弥漫着一种对自己的奇怪的敌意。这激起了他的固执，他奋起反抗。他又坚持了两天。结果是第四天晚上与哈利迪发生了令人厌恶和疯狂的一幕。哈利迪在咖啡馆里对杰拉德怀着荒谬的敌意。发生了一场争吵。杰拉尔德正要撞到哈利迪的脸。当他突然感到厌恶和冷漠时，他就走了，留下哈利迪处于一种幸灾乐祸的愚蠢状态，小猫坚强而坚定，而马克西姆则站在一旁。伯金不在，他又出城了。

Gerald was piqued because he had left without giving the Pussum money. It was true, she did not care whether he gave her money or not, and he knew it. But she would have been glad of ten pounds, and he would have been VERY glad to give them to her. Now he felt in a false position. He went away chewing his lips to get at the ends of his short clipped moustache. He knew the Pussum was merely glad to be rid of him. She had got her Halliday whom she wanted. She wanted him completely in her power. Then she would marry him. She wanted to marry him. She had set her will on marrying Halliday. She never wanted to hear of Gerald again; unless, perhaps, she were in difficulty; because after all, Gerald was what she called a man, and these others, Halliday, Libidnikov, Birkin, the whole Bohemian set, they were only half men. But it was half men she could deal with. She felt sure of herself with them. The real men, like Gerald, put her in her place too much.
杰拉德很生气，因为他没有给普苏姆钱就离开了。确实，她不在乎他给不给她钱，他也知道。但她会很高兴能得到十英镑，而他也会很高兴把它们给她。现在他感觉自己处于一种错误的境地。他走开时，咀嚼着嘴唇，想吃一下剪短的小胡子的末端。他知道猫咪只是因为摆脱了他而感到高兴。她得到了她想要的哈利迪。她想要他完全在她的掌控之中。然后她就会嫁给他。她想嫁给他。她立下遗嘱要嫁给哈利迪。她再也不想听到杰拉德的消息了。或许，除非她遇到了困难；因为毕竟，杰拉尔德就是她所谓的男人，而其他人，哈利迪、利比德尼科夫、伯金，整个波西米亚人，他们只是半个男人。但她能对付的只是半个男人。和他们在一起，她感到很自信。真正的男人，比如杰拉德，太把她放在自己的位置上了。

Still, she respected Gerald, she really respected him. She had managed to get his address, so that she could appeal to him in time of distress. She knew he wanted to give her money. She would perhaps write to him on that inevitable rainy day.
尽管如此，她还是尊重杰拉德，她真的很尊重他。她设法得到了他的地址，以便在遇到困难时可以向他求助。她知道他想给她钱。她也许会在那个不可避免的雨天给他写信。

CHAPTER VIII
第八章

BREADALBY
面包阿尔比

Breadalby was a Georgian house with Corinthian pillars, standing among the softer, greener hills of Derbyshire, not far from Cromford. In front, it looked over a lawn, over a few trees, down to a string of fish-ponds in the hollow of the silent park. At the back were trees, among which were to be found the stables, and the big kitchen garden, behind which was a wood.
布雷多尔比是一座带有科林斯式柱子的乔治亚风格的房子，矗立在德比郡更柔和、更翠绿的山丘中，距离克罗姆福德不远。视线越过前面的一片草坪，越过几棵树，一直看到寂静公园空地上的一串鱼塘。后面有树，其中有马厩，还有一个大菜园，菜园后面是一片树林。

It was a very quiet place, some miles from the high-road, back from the Derwent Valley, outside the show scenery. Silent and forsaken, the golden stucco showed between the trees, the house-front looked down the park, unchanged and unchanging.
这是一个非常安静的地方，距离公路有几英里，从德文特山谷回来，在表演风景之外。金色的灰泥在树林间显露出来，寂静而荒凉，房子的正面俯瞰着公园，一成不变。

Of late, however, Hermione had lived a good deal at the house. She had turned away from London, away from Oxford, towards the silence of the country. Her father was mostly absent, abroad, she was either alone in the house, with her visitors, of whom there were always several, or she had with her her brother, a bachelor, and a Liberal member of Parliament. He always came down when the House was not sitting, seemed always to be present in Breadalby, although he was most conscientious in his attendance to duty.
然而，最近赫敏在这所房子里住了很多时间。她离开了伦敦，离开了牛津，走向了寂静的乡村。她的父亲大部分时间都不在国外，她要么独自一人待在家里，和来访者在一起，而来访者总是有好几个，要么她和她的哥哥在一起，她的哥哥是一名单身汉，也是一名自由党议员。当众议院不开会时，他总是下楼，似乎总是在布莱多尔比，尽管他在履行职责时是最认真的。

The summer was just coming in when Ursula and Gudrun went to stay the second time with Hermione. Coming along in the car, after they had entered the park, they looked across the dip, where the fish-ponds lay in silence, at the pillared front of the house, sunny and small like an English drawing of the old school, on the brow of the green hill, against the trees. There were small figures on the green lawn, women in lavender and yellow moving to the shade of the enormous, beautifully balanced cedar tree.
夏天刚刚到来，乌苏拉和古德伦第二次去赫敏家住。他们坐车一路走来，进入公园后，目光越过洼地，鱼塘静静地躺在那里，望着有柱子的房子前面，阳光明媚，很小，就像一幅英国老学校的图画，在花园里。青山之巅，绿树成荫。绿色的草坪上有一些小人物，穿着淡紫色和黄色衣服的女人移动到巨大、美丽平衡的雪松树的树荫下。

‘Isn’t it complete!’ said Gudrun. ‘It is as final as an old aquatint.’ She spoke with some resentment in her voice, as if she were captivated unwillingly, as if she must admire against her will.
“还没有完成吗！”古德伦说。 “就像一幅古老的凹版画一样，是最后的作品。”她说话的语气中带着些许怨恨，仿佛她不情愿地被迷住了，仿佛她必须违背自己的意愿去欣赏。

‘Do you love it?’ asked Ursula.
“你喜欢它吗？”乌苏拉问。

‘I don’t LOVE it, but in its way, I think it is quite complete.’
“我不喜欢它，但就其方式而言，我认为它相当完整。”

The motor-car ran down the hill and up again in one breath, and they were curving to the side door. A parlour-maid appeared, and then Hermione, coming forward with her pale face lifted, and her hands outstretched, advancing straight to the new-comers, her voice singing:
汽车一口气下山又上山，拐向侧门。一位女仆出现了，然后赫敏走上前来，苍白的脸抬起来，伸出双手，径直走向新来者，她的声音唱着：

‘Here you are—I’m so glad to see you—‘ she kissed Gudrun—‘so glad to see you—‘ she kissed Ursula and remained with her arm round her. ‘Are you very tired?’
“你在这里——我很高兴见到你——”她吻了古德伦——“很高兴见到你——”她吻了乌苏拉，并用手臂搂着她。 “你很累吗？”

‘Not at all tired,’ said Ursula.
“一点也不累，”乌苏拉说。

‘Are you tired, Gudrun?’
“你累了吗，古德伦？”

‘Not at all, thanks,’ said Gudrun.
“一点也不，谢谢，”古德伦说。

‘No—‘ drawled Hermione. And she stood and looked at them. The two girls were embarrassed because she would not move into the house, but must have her little scene of welcome there on the path. The servants waited.
“不——”赫敏慢吞吞地说。她站起来看着他们。两个女孩感到很尴尬，因为她不会搬进房子，但必须在路上有她的欢迎小场面。仆人们等待着。

‘Come in,’ said Hermione at last, having fully taken in the pair of them. Gudrun was the more beautiful and attractive, she had decided again, Ursula was more physical, more womanly. She admired Gudrun’s dress more. It was of green poplin, with a loose coat above it, of broad, dark-green and dark-brown stripes. The hat was of a pale, greenish straw, the colour of new hay, and it had a plaited ribbon of black and orange, the stockings were dark green, the shoes black. It was a good get-up, at once fashionable and individual. Ursula, in dark blue, was more ordinary, though she also looked well.
“进来吧，”赫敏终于说道，完全注意到了他们两个。她再次认定，古德伦更美丽、更有魅力，而乌苏拉则更健壮，更有女人味。她更欣赏古德伦的衣服。它是绿色府绸制成的，上面有一件宽松的外套，上面有宽阔的深绿色和深棕色条纹。帽子是淡绿色的稻草制成的，颜色像新干草，上面有一条黑色和橙色的编织丝带，长袜是深绿色的，鞋子是黑色的。这是一套很好的装扮，既时尚又个性。乌苏拉一身深蓝色的衣服，显得比较普通，不过看上去也不错。

Hermione herself wore a dress of prune-coloured silk, with coral beads and coral coloured stockings. But her dress was both shabby and soiled, even rather dirty.
赫敏本人穿着一件梅子色丝绸连衣裙，上面有珊瑚珠和珊瑚色长袜。但她的衣服又破又脏，甚至有些脏。

‘You would like to see your rooms now, wouldn’t you! Yes. We will go up now, shall we?’
“你现在想看看你的房间，不是吗！是的。我们现在就上去，好吗？

Ursula was glad when she could be left alone in her room. Hermione lingered so long, made such a stress on one. She stood so near to one, pressing herself near upon one, in a way that was most embarrassing and oppressive. She seemed to hinder one’s workings.
乌苏拉很高兴能把她一个人留在自己的房间里。赫敏逗留了这么久，给一个人带来了如此大的压力。她站得离一个人那么近，把自己压在一个人身上，以一种最尴尬和压抑的方式。她似乎妨碍了人们的工作。

Lunch was served on the lawn, under the great tree, whose thick, blackish boughs came down close to the grass. There were present a young Italian woman, slight and fashionable, a young, athletic-looking Miss Bradley, a learned, dry Baronet of fifty, who was always making witticisms and laughing at them heartily in a harsh, horse-laugh, there was Rupert Birkin, and then a woman secretary, a Fraulein Marz, young and slim and pretty.
午餐是在草坪上的一棵大树下吃的，这棵树粗壮的黑色树枝靠近草地。在场的有一位年轻的意大利女人，身材苗条，时尚，一位年轻、运动型的布拉德利小姐，一位学识渊博、干巴巴的五十岁准男爵，她总是说些俏皮话，用一种刺耳的马笑声开怀大笑，还有鲁珀特伯金包，然后是一位女秘书，一位玛兹小姐，年轻、苗条、漂亮。

The food was very good, that was one thing. Gudrun, critical of everything, gave it her full approval. Ursula loved the situation, the white table by the cedar tree, the scent of new sunshine, the little vision of the leafy park, with far-off deer feeding peacefully. There seemed a magic circle drawn about the place, shutting out the present, enclosing the delightful, precious past, trees and deer and silence, like a dream.
食物非常好，这是一回事。古德伦对一切都持批评态度，对此她表示完全赞同。乌苏拉喜欢这样的环境，雪松树旁的白色桌子，新阳光的气味，绿树成荫的公园的小视野，远处的鹿在安静地吃食。这个地方似乎画了一个魔法阵，把现在拒之门外，把令人愉快、珍贵的过去、树木、鹿和寂静包围起来，就像一场梦。

But in spirit she was unhappy. The talk went on like a rattle of small artillery, always slightly sententious, with a sententiousness that was only emphasised by the continual crackling of a witticism, the continual spatter of verbal jest, designed to give a tone of flippancy to a stream of conversation that was all critical and general, a canal of conversation rather than a stream.
但精神上她并不高兴。谈话像小炮的嘎嘎声一样继续下去，总是略带俏皮话，只有不断的俏皮话、不断的口头笑话才强调了这种俏皮话，旨在给一连串的谈话增添一种轻率的语气。都是批判性的和笼统的，是对话的渠道而不是溪流。

The attitude was mental and very wearying. Only the elderly sociologist, whose mental fibre was so tough as to be insentient, seemed to be thoroughly happy. Birkin was down in the mouth. Hermione appeared, with amazing persistence, to wish to ridicule him and make him look ignominious in the eyes of everybody. And it was surprising how she seemed to succeed, how helpless he seemed against her. He looked completely insignificant. Ursula and Gudrun, both very unused, were mostly silent, listening to the slow, rhapsodic sing-song of Hermione, or the verbal sallies of Sir Joshua, or the prattle of Fraulein, or the responses of the other two women.
这种态度是精神上的，而且非常令人疲惫。只有那位精神纤维坚韧到没有知觉的老年社会学家，看上去十分高兴。柏金包放在嘴里。赫敏似乎以惊人的毅力想要嘲笑他，让他在众人眼中丢脸。令人惊讶的是，她似乎取得了成功，而他在她面前却显得如此无助。他看起来完全微不足道。乌苏拉和古德伦都不太习惯，大部分时间都保持沉默，听着赫敏缓慢而狂想曲的歌声，或者约书亚爵士的口头俏皮话，或者弗劳林的闲聊，或者其他两个女人的反应。

Luncheon was over, coffee was brought out on the grass, the party left the table and sat about in lounge chairs, in the shade or in the sunshine as they wished. Fraulein departed into the house, Hermione took up her embroidery, the little Contessa took a book, Miss Bradley was weaving a basket out of fine grass, and there they all were on the lawn in the early summer afternoon, working leisurely and spattering with half-intellectual, deliberate talk.
午餐结束，咖啡被端到草地上，大家离开餐桌，坐在躺椅上，在阴凉处或阳光下随心所欲地坐着。小姐走进屋里，赫敏拿起她的刺绣，小伯爵夫人拿着一本书，布拉德利小姐正在用细草编织一个篮子，初夏的午后，他们都在草坪上，悠闲地工作着，洒满了一半的东西。 - 理智、深思熟虑的谈话。

Suddenly there was the sound of the brakes and the shutting off of a motor-car.
突然传来刹车声和汽车熄火的声音。

‘There’s Salsie!’ sang Hermione, in her slow, amusing sing-song. And laying down her work, she rose slowly, and slowly passed over the lawn, round the bushes, out of sight.
“萨尔西来了！”赫敏用她缓慢而有趣的歌声唱道。她放下手中的活儿，缓缓起身，慢慢地越过草坪，绕过灌木丛，消失在视线之外。

‘Who is it?’ asked Gudrun.
“是谁？”古德伦问。

‘Mr Roddice—Miss Roddice’s brother—at least, I suppose it’s he,’ said Sir Joshua.
“罗迪斯先生——罗迪斯小姐的弟弟——至少，我想是他，”约书亚爵士说。

‘Salsie, yes, it is her brother,’ said the little Contessa, lifting her head for a moment from her book, and speaking as if to give information, in her slightly deepened, guttural English.
“莎尔西，是的，这是她的兄弟，”小伯爵夫人说，她从书本上抬起了一会儿头，用她略带深沉的喉音英语说话，仿佛在提供信息。

They all waited. And then round the bushes came the tall form of Alexander Roddice, striding romantically like a Meredith hero who remembers Disraeli. He was cordial with everybody, he was at once a host, with an easy, offhand hospitality that he had learned for Hermione’s friends. He had just come down from London, from the House. At once the atmosphere of the House of Commons made itself felt over the lawn: the Home Secretary had said such and such a thing, and he, Roddice, on the other hand, thought such and such a thing, and had said so-and-so to the PM.
他们都在等待。然后，亚历山大·罗迪斯 (Alexander Roddice) 的高大身影绕过灌木丛，大步迈进，就像梅雷迪斯 (Meredith) 英雄回忆起迪斯雷利 (Disraeli) 一样。他对每个人都很热情，他立刻就是一个主人，带着他从赫敏的朋友那里学到的轻松、随性的热情好客。他刚刚从伦敦从众议院回来。草坪上顿时弥漫着下议院的气氛：内政大臣说了这样那样的话，而他罗迪斯却想了这样那样的话，说了这样那样的话。 -所以对总理来说。

Now Hermione came round the bushes with Gerald Crich. He had come along with Alexander. Gerald was presented to everybody, was kept by Hermione for a few moments in full view, then he was led away, still by Hermione. He was evidently her guest of the moment.
现在赫敏和杰拉尔德·克里奇一起绕过灌木丛。他是和亚历山大一起来的。杰拉德被介绍给所有人，赫敏在众目睽睽之下待了一会儿，然后他被带走了，仍然被赫敏带走。他显然是她此刻的客人。

There had been a split in the Cabinet; the minister for Education had resigned owing to adverse criticism. This started a conversation on education.
内阁内部出现了分裂。教育部长因批评而辞职。一场关于教育的对话由此展开。

‘Of course,’ said Hermione, lifting her face like a rhapsodist, ‘there CAN be no reason, no EXCUSE for education, except the joy and beauty of knowledge in itself.’ She seemed to rumble and ruminate with subterranean thoughts for a minute, then she proceeded: ‘Vocational education ISN’T education, it is the close of education.’
“当然，”赫敏像个狂想曲家一样抬起脸，“除了知识本身的快乐和美丽之外，教育没有任何理由和借口。”她似乎在沉思片刻，沉思着一些隐秘的想法。 ，然后她接着说：“职业教育不是教育，它是教育的终结。”

Gerald, on the brink of discussion, sniffed the air with delight and prepared for action.
正要讨论的杰拉尔德高兴地嗅了嗅空气，准备采取行动。

‘Not necessarily,’ he said. ‘But isn’t education really like gymnastics, isn’t the end of education the production of a well-trained, vigorous, energetic mind?’
“不一定，”他说。 “但是，教育难道真的就像体操吗？教育的目的不就是培养训练有素、充满活力、精力充沛的头脑吗？”

‘Just as athletics produce a healthy body, ready for anything,’ cried Miss Bradley, in hearty accord.
“正如田径运动可以培养健康的身体，为任何事情做好准备一样，”布拉德利小姐衷心地喊道。

Gudrun looked at her in silent loathing.
古德伦沉默地厌恶地看着她。

‘Well—‘ rumbled Hermione, ‘I don’t know. To me the pleasure of knowing is so great, so WONDERFUL—nothing has meant so much to me in all life, as certain knowledge—no, I am sure—nothing.’
“嗯——”赫敏咕哝道，“我不知道。”对我来说，了解知识的乐趣是如此巨大，如此美妙——在我的一生中，没有什么比某些知识更重要的了——不，我确信——什么都没有。

‘What knowledge, for example, Hermione?’ asked Alexander.
“例如，什么知识，赫敏？”亚历山大问。

Hermione lifted her face and rumbled—
赫敏抬起脸，低声说道——

‘M—m—m—I don’t know … But one thing was the stars, when I really understood something about the stars. One feels so UPLIFTED, so UNBOUNDED …’
“嗯——嗯——我不知道……但一件事就是星星，当我真正了解一些关于星星的事情时。人们感觉如此振奋，如此无拘无束……”

Birkin looked at her in a white fury.
伯金愤怒地看着她。

‘What do you want to feel unbounded for?’ he said sarcastically. ‘You don’t want to BE unbounded.’
“你想要什么不受限制的感觉？”他讽刺地说。 “你不想不受限制。”

Hermione recoiled in offence.
赫敏因为冒犯而退缩了。

‘Yes, but one does have that limitless feeling,’ said Gerald. ‘It’s like getting on top of the mountain and seeing the Pacific.’
“是的，但人确实有那种无限的感觉，”杰拉德说。 “这就像登上山顶看到太平洋一样。”

‘Silent upon a peak in Dariayn,’ murmured the Italian, lifting her face for a moment from her book.
“达里安的山峰上一片寂静。”意大利人低声说道，暂时把脸从书本上抬起来。

‘Not necessarily in Dariayn,’ said Gerald, while Ursula began to laugh.
“不一定是在达里安，”杰拉尔德说，而乌苏拉开始大笑。

Hermione waited for the dust to settle, and then she said, untouched:
赫敏等待着尘埃落定，然后面无表情地说：

‘Yes, it is the greatest thing in life—to KNOW. It is really to be happy, to be FREE.’
“是的，生命中最伟大的事情就是知道。”这真的是快乐、自由。”

‘Knowledge is, of course, liberty,’ said Mattheson.
“知识当然就是自由，”马特森说。

‘In compressed tabloids,’ said Birkin, looking at the dry, stiff little body of the Baronet. Immediately Gudrun saw the famous sociologist as a flat bottle, containing tabloids of compressed liberty. That pleased her. Sir Joshua was labelled and placed forever in her mind.
“在压缩的小报中，”伯金看着准男爵干燥、僵硬的小身体说道。古德伦立即将这位著名的社会学家视为一个扁瓶，里面装着压缩自由的小报。这让她很高兴。约书亚爵士被贴上了标签，永远留在了她的脑海里。

‘What does that mean, Rupert?’ sang Hermione, in a calm snub.
“鲁珀特，这是什么意思？”赫敏平静地冷漠地唱道。

‘You can only have knowledge, strictly,’ he replied, ‘of things concluded, in the past. It’s like bottling the liberty of last summer in the bottled gooseberries.’
“严格来说，你只能了解过去得出的结论，”他回答道。这就像把去年夏天的自由装在瓶装醋栗里。”

‘CAN one have knowledge only of the past?’ asked the Baronet, pointedly. ‘Could we call our knowledge of the laws of gravitation for instance, knowledge of the past?’
“一个人只能了解过去吗？”男爵尖锐地问道。 “我们可以把我们对万有引力定律的知识称为对过去的知识吗？”

‘Yes,’ said Birkin.
“是的，”伯金说。

‘There is a most beautiful thing in my book,’ suddenly piped the little Italian woman. ‘It says the man came to the door and threw his eyes down the street.’
“我的书中有一件最美丽的东西，”意大利小女人突然尖声说道。 “据说那个男人来到门口，把目光投向了街道。”

There was a general laugh in the company. Miss Bradley went and looked over the shoulder of the Contessa.
公司里一片哄堂大笑。布拉德利小姐走过去，从伯爵夫人的肩膀后面望去。

‘See!’ said the Contessa.
“看！”伯爵夫人说。

‘Bazarov came to the door and threw his eyes hurriedly down the street,’ she read.
“巴扎罗夫来到门口，迅速将目光投向街道，”她读到。

Again there was a loud laugh, the most startling of which was the Baronet’s, which rattled out like a clatter of falling stones.
又是一阵大声的笑声，其中最令人吃惊的是从男爵的笑声，笑声像落下的石头发出的嘎嘎声。

‘What is the book?’ asked Alexander, promptly.
“这本书是什么？”亚历山大立即问道。

‘Fathers and Sons, by Turgenev,’ said the little foreigner, pronouncing every syllable distinctly. She looked at the cover, to verify herself.
“屠格涅夫的《父与子》，”小个子外国人说，每个音节都发音清晰。她看了看封面，想验证一下自己的身份。

‘An old American edition,’ said Birkin.
“美国旧版，”伯金说。

‘Ha!—of course—translated from the French,’ said Alexander, with a fine declamatory voice. ‘Bazarov ouvra la porte et jeta les yeux dans la rue.’
“哈！——当然——是从法语翻译过来的，”亚历山大用优美的朗诵声说道。 “Bazarov ouvra la porte et jeta les yeux dans la rue。”

He looked brightly round the company.
他环顾公司，目光明亮。

‘I wonder what the ‘hurriedly’ was,’ said Ursula.
“我想知道‘匆忙’是什么意思，”乌苏拉说。

They all began to guess.
他们都开始猜测。

And then, to the amazement of everybody, the maid came hurrying with a large tea-tray. The afternoon had passed so swiftly.
就在这时，令众人惊讶的是，女仆端着一个大茶盘急匆匆地走了过来。下午的时间过得真快。

After tea, they were all gathered for a walk.
喝完茶后，大家聚在一起散步。

‘Would you like to come for a walk?’ said Hermione to each of them, one by one. And they all said yes, feeling somehow like prisoners marshalled for exercise. Birkin only refused.
“你们想一起去散步吗？”赫敏一一对他们每个人说道。他们都答应了，感觉就像是被集中起来锻炼身体的囚犯。伯金只是拒绝了。

‘Will you come for a walk, Rupert?’
“鲁珀特，你能来散步吗？”

‘No, Hermione.’
“不，赫敏。”

‘But are you SURE?’
“但是你确定吗？”

‘Quite sure.’ There was a second’s hesitation.
“非常确定。”犹豫了一秒钟。

‘And why not?’ sang Hermione’s question. It made her blood run sharp, to be thwarted in even so trifling a matter. She intended them all to walk with her in the park.
“为什么不呢？”赫敏问道。连这么一件小事都遭到阻挠，这让她的血液急剧流动。她想让他们都和她一起去公园散步。

‘Because I don’t like trooping off in a gang,’ he said.
“因为我不喜欢成群结队，”他说。

Her voice rumbled in her throat for a moment. Then she said, with a curious stray calm:
她的声音一时在喉咙里咕咕作响。然后她带着一种奇怪的平静说道：

‘Then we’ll leave a little boy behind, if he’s sulky.’
“那我们就留下一个小男孩，如果他不高兴的话。”

And she looked really gay, while she insulted him. But it merely made him stiff.
当她侮辱他时，她看起来真的很同性恋。但这只是让他变得僵硬。

She trailed off to the rest of the company, only turning to wave her handkerchief to him, and to chuckle with laughter, singing out:
她的声音逐渐减弱，走向其他人，只是转身向他挥动手帕，咯咯地笑起来，唱道：

‘Good-bye, good-bye, little boy.’
“再见，再见，小男孩。”

‘Good-bye, impudent hag,’ he said to himself.
“再见，无礼的女巫，”他对自己说。

They all went through the park. Hermione wanted to show them the wild daffodils on a little slope. ‘This way, this way,’ sang her leisurely voice at intervals. And they had all to come this way. The daffodils were pretty, but who could see them? Ursula was stiff all over with resentment by this time, resentment of the whole atmosphere. Gudrun, mocking and objective, watched and registered everything.
他们都穿过公园。赫敏想带他们去看小斜坡上的野生水仙花。 “这边，这边。”她不时地悠闲地唱道。他们都必须走这条路。水仙花很漂亮，但是谁能看到它们呢？乌苏拉此时浑身僵硬，充满了怨恨，对整个气氛的怨恨。古德伦冷嘲热讽，客观地观察并记录着一切。

They looked at the shy deer, and Hermione talked to the stag, as if he too were a boy she wanted to wheedle and fondle. He was male, so she must exert some kind of power over him. They trailed home by the fish-ponds, and Hermione told them about the quarrel of two male swans, who had striven for the love of the one lady. She chuckled and laughed as she told how the ousted lover had sat with his head buried under his wing, on the gravel.
他们看着害羞的鹿，赫敏和雄鹿说话，就好像他也是一个她想要哄骗和抚摸的男孩。他是男性，所以她必须对他施加某种力量。他们沿着鱼塘拖回家，赫敏向他们讲述了两只雄性天鹅为争夺一位女士的爱情而发生的争吵。当她讲述被驱逐的情人如何将头埋在翅膀下坐在砾石上时，她咯咯地笑着。

When they arrived back at the house, Hermione stood on the lawn and sang out, in a strange, small, high voice that carried very far:
当他们回到家时，赫敏站在草坪上，用一种奇怪的、微小的、高亢的声音唱道：

‘Rupert! Rupert!’ The first syllable was high and slow, the second dropped down. ‘Roo-o-opert.’
‘鲁珀特！鲁珀特！”第一个音节又高又慢，第二个音节就低下来了。 “Roo-o-opert。”

But there was no answer. A maid appeared.
但没有得到任何答复。一个女仆出现了。

‘Where is Mr Birkin, Alice?’ asked the mild straying voice of Hermione. But under the straying voice, what a persistent, almost insane WILL!
“伯金先生在哪儿，爱丽丝？”赫敏用温和的、迷离的声音问道。但在那飘忽不定的声音之下，是多么执着、近乎疯狂的意志啊！

‘I think he’s in his room, madam.’
“我想他在自己的房间里，女士。”

‘Is he?’
'是他？'

Hermione went slowly up the stairs, along the corridor, singing out in her high, small call:
赫敏沿着走廊慢慢走上楼梯，用她那高亢的小叫声唱道：

‘Ru-oo-pert! Ru-oo pert!’
‘Ru-oo-pert！ Ru-oo pert！’

She came to his door, and tapped, still crying: ‘Roo-pert.’
她来到他的门前，敲了敲门，仍然哭着：“Roo-pert。”

‘Yes,’ sounded his voice at last.
“是的，”他的声音终于响起。

‘What are you doing?’
'你在干什么？'

The question was mild and curious.
这个问题很温和，也很好奇。

There was no answer. Then he opened the door.
没有人回答。然后他打开了门。

‘We’ve come back,’ said Hermione. ‘The daffodils are SO beautiful.’
“我们回来了，”赫敏说。 “水仙花真漂亮。”

‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen them.’
“是的，”他说，“我见过他们。”

She looked at him with her long, slow, impassive look, along her cheeks.
她用长长的、缓慢的、冷漠的目光沿着脸颊看着他。

‘Have you?’ she echoed. And she remained looking at him. She was stimulated above all things by this conflict with him, when he was like a sulky boy, helpless, and she had him safe at Breadalby. But underneath she knew the split was coming, and her hatred of him was subconscious and intense.
“你有吗？”她重复道。而她仍然看着他。最令她兴奋的是与他的冲突，当时他就像一个闷闷不乐的男孩，无助，而她把他安全地留在了布雷多尔比。但内心深处，她知道分裂即将到来，她对他的仇恨是潜意识的、强烈的。

‘What were you doing?’ she reiterated, in her mild, indifferent tone. He did not answer, and she made her way, almost unconsciously into his room. He had taken a Chinese drawing of geese from the boudoir, and was copying it, with much skill and vividness.
“你在做什么？”她用温和、冷漠的语气重复道。他没有回答，她几乎是无意识地走进了他的房间。他从闺中取了一幅中国画大雁，正在临摹，技巧娴熟，栩栩如生。

‘You are copying the drawing,’ she said, standing near the table, and looking down at his work. ‘Yes. How beautifully you do it! You like it very much, don’t you?’
“你在临摹这幅画，”她站在桌子旁边，低头看着他的作品。 '是的。你做得多么漂亮啊！你非常喜欢它，不是吗？

‘It’s a marvellous drawing,’ he said.
“这是一幅奇妙的图画，”他说。

‘Is it? I’m so glad you like it, because I’ve always been fond of it. The Chinese Ambassador gave it me.’
'是吗？我很高兴你喜欢它，因为我一直很喜欢它。中国大使给我的。”

‘I know,’ he said.
“我知道，”他说。

‘But why do you copy it?’ she asked, casual and sing-song. ‘Why not do something original?’
“但是你为什么要复制它呢？”她随意地问道。 “为什么不做一些原创的事情呢？”

‘I want to know it,’ he replied. ‘One gets more of China, copying this picture, than reading all the books.’
“我想知道，”他回答道。 “临摹这张照片比阅读所有书籍更能了解中国。”

‘And what do you get?’
“你得到了什么？”

She was at once roused, she laid as it were violent hands on him, to extract his secrets from him. She MUST know. It was a dreadful tyranny, an obsession in her, to know all he knew. For some time he was silent, hating to answer her. Then, compelled, he began:
她立刻被惊醒，她像猛烈的手一样放在他身上，想从他身上套出他的秘密。她一定知道。她想要知道他所知道的一切，这是一种可怕的暴政，一种痴迷。有一段时间他沉默了，不愿回答她。然后，他被迫开始：

‘I know what centres they live from—what they perceive and feel—the hot, stinging centrality of a goose in the flux of cold water and mud—the curious bitter stinging heat of a goose’s blood, entering their own blood like an inoculation of corruptive fire—fire of the cold-burning mud—the lotus mystery.’
“我知道它们生活的中心是什么——它们感知和感受的东西——鹅在冷水和泥土的流动中的炎热、刺痛的中心——鹅血液中奇特的苦涩的刺痛热，进入它们自己的血液，就像接种疫苗一样腐败之火——寒冷燃烧的泥土之火——莲花的神秘。

Hermione looked at him along her narrow, pallid cheeks. Her eyes were strange and drugged, heavy under their heavy, drooping lids. Her thin bosom shrugged convulsively. He stared back at her, devilish and unchanging. With another strange, sick convulsion, she turned away, as if she were sick, could feel dissolution setting-in in her body. For with her mind she was unable to attend to his words, he caught her, as it were, beneath all her defences, and destroyed her with some insidious occult potency.
赫敏沿着她那狭长苍白的脸颊看着他。她的眼睛很奇怪，充满了迷药，在沉重、下垂的眼睑下显得沉重。她那瘦弱的胸脯痉挛地耸耸肩。他回望着她，眼神邪恶而一成不变。又一阵奇怪的、病态的抽搐，她转过身去，仿佛她生病了，能感觉到身体正在溶解。因为她的头脑无法听从他的话，他在她所有的防御下抓住了她，并用某种阴险的神秘力量摧毁了她。

‘Yes,’ she said, as if she did not know what she were saying. ‘Yes,’ and she swallowed, and tried to regain her mind. But she could not, she was witless, decentralised. Use all her will as she might, she could not recover. She suffered the ghastliness of dissolution, broken and gone in a horrible corruption. And he stood and looked at her unmoved. She strayed out, pallid and preyed-upon like a ghost, like one attacked by the tomb-influences which dog us. And she was gone like a corpse, that has no presence, no connection. He remained hard and vindictive.
“是的，”她说，好像她不知道自己在说什么。 “是的。”她咽了口口水，试图恢复理智。但她不能，她没有智慧，权力分散。尽了全力，她也无法康复。她遭受了可怕的解体、破碎和可怕的腐化。而他站起来，一动不动地看着她。她迷失了方向，脸色苍白，像一个幽灵一样被猎食，就像一个被困扰我们的坟墓影响所攻击的人。她就像一具尸体一样消失了，没有存在感，没有联系。他仍然冷酷无情，充满报复心。

Hermione came down to dinner strange and sepulchral, her eyes heavy and full of sepulchral darkness, strength. She had put on a dress of stiff old greenish brocade, that fitted tight and made her look tall and rather terrible, ghastly. In the gay light of the drawing-room she was uncanny and oppressive. But seated in the half-light of the diningroom, sitting stiffly before the shaded candles on the table, she seemed a power, a presence. She listened and attended with a drugged attention.
赫敏下楼去吃晚饭，气氛怪异而阴森，她的眼神沉重，充满阴森的黑暗和力量。她穿上了一件僵硬的旧绿色锦缎连衣裙，紧身合身，使她看起来很高，而且相当可怕，可怕。在客厅明亮的灯光下，她显得怪异而压抑。但坐在餐厅昏暗的灯光下，僵硬地坐在桌子上的蜡烛前，她似乎有一种力量，一种存在。她全神贯注地听着、听着。

The party was gay and extravagant in appearance, everybody had put on evening dress except Birkin and Joshua Mattheson. The little Italian Contessa wore a dress of tissue, of orange and gold and black velvet in soft wide stripes, Gudrun was emerald green with strange net-work, Ursula was in yellow with dull silver veiling, Miss Bradley was of grey, crimson and jet, Fraulein Marz wore pale blue. It gave Hermione a sudden convulsive sensation of pleasure, to see these rich colours under the candle-light. She was aware of the talk going on, ceaselessly, Joshua’s voice dominating; of the ceaseless pitter-patter of women’s light laughter and responses; of the brilliant colours and the white table and the shadow above and below; and she seemed in a swoon of gratification, convulsed with pleasure and yet sick, like a REVENANT. She took very little part in the conversation, yet she heard it all, it was all hers.
晚会气氛欢快、奢华，除了柏金和约书亚·马特森之外，所有人都穿上了晚礼服。小意大利伯爵夫人穿着橙色、金色和黑色天鹅绒制成的薄纱连衣裙，上面有柔软的宽条纹，古德伦穿着翠绿色的衣服，上面有奇怪的网状图案，乌苏拉穿着黄色的衣服，上面有暗银色的面纱，布拉德利小姐穿着灰色、深红色和黑玉色的衣服。弗劳林·马兹 (Fraulein Marz) 身穿淡蓝色衣服。看到烛光下这些丰富的色彩，赫敏突然感到一阵痉挛般的愉悦。她意识到谈话在不停地进行，约书亚的声音占主导地位。妇女们不断发出的轻笑声和反应；绚丽的色彩、白色的桌子以及上下的阴影；她似乎欣喜若狂，高兴得浑身抽搐，但又感到恶心，就像一个亡灵。她很少参与谈话，但她听到了一切，这一切都是她的。

They all went together into the drawing-room, as if they were one family, easily, without any attention to ceremony. Fraulein handed the coffee, everybody smoked cigarettes, or else long warden pipes of white clay, of which a sheaf was provided.
他们一起走进客厅，就像一家人一样，轻松自在，没有任何仪式感。小姐递上咖啡，每个人都抽烟，或者用长长的白粘土烟斗，其中有一捆。

‘Will you smoke?—cigarettes or pipe?’ asked Fraulein prettily. There was a circle of people, Sir Joshua with his eighteenth-century appearance, Gerald the amused, handsome young Englishman, Alexander tall and the handsome politician, democratic and lucid, Hermione strange like a long Cassandra, and the women lurid with colour, all dutifully smoking their long white pipes, and sitting in a half-moon in the comfortable, soft-lighted drawing-room, round the logs that flickered on the marble hearth.
“你会抽烟吗？——香烟还是烟斗？”弗劳林漂亮地问道。周围有一圈人，约书亚爵士有着十八世纪的外貌，杰拉尔德是个有趣的、英俊的年轻英国人，亚历山大是个高大英俊的政治家，民主而清醒，赫敏像长长的卡珊德拉一样奇怪，还有那些色彩鲜艳的女人，所有人尽职尽责地抽着长长的白色烟斗，坐在舒适、光线柔和的客厅里，围着大理石壁炉上摇曳的原木，形成半月形。

The talk was very often political or sociological, and interesting, curiously anarchistic. There was an accumulation of powerful force in the room, powerful and destructive. Everything seemed to be thrown into the melting pot, and it seemed to Ursula they were all witches, helping the pot to bubble. There was an elation and a satisfaction in it all, but it was cruelly exhausting for the new-comers, this ruthless mental pressure, this powerful, consuming, destructive mentality that emanated from Joshua and Hermione and Birkin and dominated the rest.
这些谈话常常是政治性的或社会学的，而且很有趣，而且是奇怪的无政府主义。房间内凝聚着强大的力量，威力强大，具有毁灭性。一切似乎都被扔进了熔炉，在乌苏拉看来，他们都是女巫，帮助熔炉冒泡。这一切充满了兴奋和满足，但对新来者来说却是残酷的疲惫，这种无情的精神压力，这种强大的、消耗性的、破坏性的心态从约书亚、赫敏和伯金身上散发出来，并主导着其他人。

But a sickness, a fearful nausea gathered possession of Hermione. There was a lull in the talk, as it was arrested by her unconscious but all-powerful will.
但赫敏却感到一种恶心，一种可怕的恶心。谈话变得平静，因为她无意识但全能的意志阻止了谈话。

‘Salsie, won’t you play something?’ said Hermione, breaking off completely. ‘Won’t somebody dance? Gudrun, you will dance, won’t you? I wish you would. Anche tu, Palestra, ballerai?—si, per piacere. You too, Ursula.’
“莎尔西，你不想演奏点什么吗？”赫敏完全打断了说道。 ‘没有人跳舞吗？古珍，你会跳舞，不是吗？我希望你能。 Anche tu、Palestra、ballerai？-si，per piacere。你也是，乌苏拉。”

Hermione rose and slowly pulled the gold-embroidered band that hung by the mantel, clinging to it for a moment, then releasing it suddenly. Like a priestess she looked, unconscious, sunk in a heavy half-trance.
赫敏站起身来，慢慢地拉动挂在壁炉架上的金绣带子，抓住了一会儿，然后突然松开了。她看起来就像一位女祭司，失去知觉，陷入了严重的半恍惚状态。

A servant came, and soon reappeared with armfuls of silk robes and shawls and scarves, mostly oriental, things that Hermione, with her love for beautiful extravagant dress, had collected gradually.
一名仆人来了，很快又出现了，手里抱着一大堆丝质长袍、披肩和围巾，这些东西大多是东方风格的，这些都是赫敏出于对美丽奢华服饰的喜爱，逐渐收集起来的。

‘The three women will dance together,’ she said.
“这三个女人将一起跳舞，”她说。

‘What shall it be?’ asked Alexander, rising briskly.
“那会是什么？”亚历山大轻快地站起来问道。

‘Vergini Delle Rocchette,’ said the Contessa at once.
“Vergini Delle Rocchette，”伯爵夫人立刻说道。

‘They are so languid,’ said Ursula.
“他们太无精打采了，”乌苏拉说。

‘The three witches from Macbeth,’ suggested Fraulein usefully. It was finally decided to do Naomi and Ruth and Orpah. Ursula was Naomi, Gudrun was Ruth, the Contessa was Orpah. The idea was to make a little ballet, in the style of the Russian Ballet of Pavlova and Nijinsky.
“《麦克白》中的三个女巫。”弗劳林很有用地建议道。最终决定由拿俄米、路得和俄珥巴来做。乌苏拉是内奥米，古德伦是露丝，伯爵夫人是奥尔帕。我们的想法是制作一部小型芭蕾舞剧，模仿巴甫洛娃和尼金斯基的俄罗斯芭蕾舞团的风格。

The Contessa was ready first, Alexander went to the piano, a space was cleared. Orpah, in beautiful oriental clothes, began slowly to dance the death of her husband. Then Ruth came, and they wept together, and lamented, then Naomi came to comfort them. It was all done in dumb show, the women danced their emotion in gesture and motion. The little drama went on for a quarter of an hour.
伯爵夫人先准备好了，亚历山大走到钢琴前，腾出了一个空间。奥尔帕穿着美丽的东方服装，开始慢慢地跳舞，以表达她丈夫的死亡。然后路得来了，他们一起哭泣，哀叹，然后拿俄米来安慰他们。这一切都是在哑剧中完成的，女人们通过手势和动作舞蹈她们的情感。这场小闹剧持续了一刻钟。

Ursula was beautiful as Naomi. All her men were dead, it remained to her only to stand alone in indomitable assertion, demanding nothing. Ruth, woman-loving, loved her. Orpah, a vivid, sensational, subtle widow, would go back to the former life, a repetition. The interplay between the women was real and rather frightening. It was strange to see how Gudrun clung with heavy, desperate passion to Ursula, yet smiled with subtle malevolence against her, how Ursula accepted silently, unable to provide any more either for herself or for the other, but dangerous and indomitable, refuting her grief.
乌苏拉和娜奥米一样美丽。她所有的手下都死了，她只能孤身一人，不屈不挠，不求任何东西。路得是个爱女人的人，很爱她。奥尔帕，一个生动、感人、微妙的寡妇，将回到以前的生活，重复。女人之间的相互作用是真实的，而且相当可怕。奇怪的是，古德伦如何怀着沉重而绝望的热情紧紧抓住乌苏拉，却又对她微笑着，带着微妙的恶意；乌苏拉如何默默地接受，无法为自己或对方提供更多，但危险而顽强，驳斥她的悲伤。

Hermione loved to watch. She could see the Contessa’s rapid, stoat-like sensationalism, Gudrun’s ultimate but treacherous cleaving to the woman in her sister, Ursula’s dangerous helplessness, as if she were helplessly weighted, and unreleased.
赫敏很喜欢看。她可以看到伯爵夫人迅速、白鼬般的轰动效应，古德伦对她姐姐身上的女人最终却又危险的依恋，乌苏拉危险的无助，仿佛她无助地沉重，无法释放。

‘That was very beautiful,’ everybody cried with one accord. But Hermione writhed in her soul, knowing what she could not know. She cried out for more dancing, and it was her will that set the Contessa and Birkin moving mockingly in Malbrouk.
“真是太美了。”大家异口同声地喊道。但赫敏的灵魂在翻腾，她知道自己不知道的事情。她大声要求更多的舞蹈，正是她的意愿让伯爵夫人和伯金在马尔布鲁克嘲笑地移动。

Gerald was excited by the desperate cleaving of Gudrun to Naomi. The essence of that female, subterranean recklessness and mockery penetrated his blood. He could not forget Gudrun’s lifted, offered, cleaving, reckless, yet withal mocking weight. And Birkin, watching like a hermit crab from its hole, had seen the brilliant frustration and helplessness of Ursula. She was rich, full of dangerous power. She was like a strange unconscious bud of powerful womanhood. He was unconsciously drawn to her. She was his future.
杰拉德对古德伦与娜奥米的绝望结合感到兴奋。那个女性的本质，潜藏的鲁莽和嘲讽渗透到了他的血液里。他无法忘记古德伦的举起、伸出、劈开，鲁莽而又带着嘲讽的重量。伯金像寄居蟹一样从洞里观察，看到了乌苏拉的挫败感和无助感。她富有，充满危险的力量。她就像一个奇怪的、无意识的、强大的女性气质的花蕾。他不自觉地就被她吸引了。她是他的未来。

Alexander played some Hungarian music, and they all danced, seized by the spirit. Gerald was marvellously exhilarated at finding himself in motion, moving towards Gudrun, dancing with feet that could not yet escape from the waltz and the two-step, but feeling his force stir along his limbs and his body, out of captivity. He did not know yet how to dance their convulsive, rag-time sort of dancing, but he knew how to begin. Birkin, when he could get free from the weight of the people present, whom he disliked, danced rapidly and with a real gaiety. And how Hermione hated him for this irresponsible gaiety.
亚历山大演奏了一些匈牙利音乐，他们都兴奋地跳舞。杰拉尔德发现自己在运动，感到非常兴奋，朝古德伦走去，用尚未摆脱华尔兹和两步舞的脚跳舞，但感觉他的力量沿着他的四肢和身体搅动，摆脱了束缚。他还不知道如何跳他们那种令人痉挛的、拉格泰姆风格的舞蹈，但他知道如何开始。当伯金能够摆脱在场的那些他不喜欢的人的重量时，他就会快速而快乐地跳舞。赫敏多么恨他这种不负责任的欢乐。

‘Now I see,’ cried the Contessa excitedly, watching his purely gay motion, which he had all to himself. ‘Mr Birkin, he is a changer.’
“现在我明白了，”伯爵夫人兴奋地喊道，看着他纯粹的快乐动作，这是他自己的。 “伯金先生，他是一个改变者。”

Hermione looked at her slowly, and shuddered, knowing that only a foreigner could have seen and have said this.
赫敏慢慢地看着她，浑身颤抖，知道只有外国人才能看到并说出这句话。

‘Cosa vuol’dire, Palestra?’ she asked, sing-song.
“Cosa vuol’dire，Palestra？”她唱着歌问道。

‘Look,’ said the Contessa, in Italian. ‘He is not a man, he is a chameleon, a creature of change.’
“看，”伯爵夫人用意大利语说道。 “他不是一个人，他是一只变色龙，一个变化的生物。”

‘He is not a man, he is treacherous, not one of us,’ said itself over in Hermione’s consciousness. And her soul writhed in the black subjugation to him, because of his power to escape, to exist, other than she did, because he was not consistent, not a man, less than a man. She hated him in a despair that shattered her and broke her down, so that she suffered sheer dissolution like a corpse, and was unconscious of everything save the horrible sickness of dissolution that was taking place within her, body and soul.
“他不是一个人，他是个奸诈人，不是我们中的一员。”赫敏的意识中不断这样说道。她的灵魂在他的黑色征服中翻腾，因为他有能力逃脱，有能力存在，而她却没有，因为他不一致，不是一个男人，比一个男人还不如。她在绝望中憎恨他，这种绝望让她心碎、崩溃，以至于她像一具尸体一样遭受彻底的解体，除了她身体和灵魂中正在发生的可怕的解体疾病之外，她对一切都没有知觉。

The house being full, Gerald was given the smaller room, really the dressing-room, communicating with Birkin’s bedroom. When they all took their candles and mounted the stairs, where the lamps were burning subduedly, Hermione captured Ursula and brought her into her own bedroom, to talk to her. A sort of constraint came over Ursula in the big, strange bedroom. Hermione seemed to be bearing down on her, awful and inchoate, making some appeal. They were looking at some Indian silk shirts, gorgeous and sensual in themselves, their shape, their almost corrupt gorgeousness. And Hermione came near, and her bosom writhed, and Ursula was for a moment blank with panic. And for a moment Hermione’s haggard eyes saw the fear on the face of the other, there was again a sort of crash, a crashing down. And Ursula picked up a shirt of rich red and blue silk, made for a young princess of fourteen, and was crying mechanically:
房子已经满了，杰拉德得到了一个较小的房间，实际上是更衣室，与伯金的卧室相连。当他们都拿着蜡烛走上楼梯时，那里的灯光柔和地燃烧着，赫敏抓住了乌苏拉，把她带进自己的卧室，和她说话。在这间又大又奇怪的卧室里，乌苏拉感到一种拘束。赫敏似乎在向她逼近，可怕而不成熟，做出了某种呼吁。他们正在看一些印度丝绸衬衫，它们本身华丽而性感，它们的形状，它们近乎腐败的华丽。赫敏走近了，她的胸部剧烈地翻腾，乌苏拉一时惊慌失措。有一瞬间，赫敏憔悴的双眼看到了对方脸上的恐惧，再次出现了一种崩溃，崩溃的感觉。乌苏拉拿起一件为十四岁的年轻公主做的华丽的红蓝丝绸衬衫，机械地哭泣着：

‘Isn’t it wonderful—who would dare to put those two strong colours together—‘
“这不是很美妙吗——谁敢把这两种强烈的颜色放在一起——”

Then Hermione’s maid entered silently and Ursula, overcome with dread, escaped, carried away by powerful impulse.
然后赫敏的女仆悄无声息地进来了，乌苏拉被恐惧压倒，被强大的冲动冲走了。

Birkin went straight to bed. He was feeling happy, and sleepy. Since he had danced he was happy. But Gerald would talk to him. Gerald, in evening dress, sat on Birkin’s bed when the other lay down, and must talk.
伯金径直上床睡觉。他感到很高兴，也很困。自从跳舞以来，他就很高兴。但杰拉德会和他说话。当伯金躺下时，杰拉尔德穿着晚礼服坐在他的床上，必须说话。

‘Who are those two Brangwens?’ Gerald asked.
“那两个布兰文家族是谁？”杰拉德问道。

‘They live in Beldover.’
“他们住在贝尔多弗。”

‘In Beldover! Who are they then?’
“在贝尔多弗！那么他们是谁呢？

‘Teachers in the Grammar School.’
“文法学校的老师。”

There was a pause.
一阵停顿。

‘They are!’ exclaimed Gerald at length. ‘I thought I had seen them before.’
“他们是！”杰拉德终于喊道。 “我以为我以前见过他们。”

‘It disappoints you?’ said Birkin.
“这让你失望吗？”伯金说。

‘Disappoints me! No—but how is it Hermione has them here?’
‘让我失望了！不——但是赫敏怎么会把它们放在这里呢？

‘She knew Gudrun in London—that’s the younger one, the one with the darker hair—she’s an artist—does sculpture and modelling.’
“她在伦敦认识古德伦——那个更年轻，头发颜色更深的——她是一位艺术家——从事雕塑和模特工作。”

‘She’s not a teacher in the Grammar School, then—only the other?’
“那么，她不是文法学校的老师——只是另一个老师？”

‘Both—Gudrun art mistress, Ursula a class mistress.’
“两者都是——古德伦艺术老师，乌苏拉是班主任。”

‘And what’s the father?’
“那父亲是谁？”

‘Handicraft instructor in the schools.’
“学校的手工艺老师。”

‘Really!’
'真的吗！'

‘Class-barriers are breaking down!’
“阶级壁垒正在被打破！”

Gerald was always uneasy under the slightly jeering tone of the other.
杰拉德在对方略带嘲讽的语气下总是感到不安。

‘That their father is handicraft instructor in a school! What does it matter to me?’
‘他们的父亲是学校的手工艺老师！这对我有什么关系？

Birkin laughed. Gerald looked at his face, as it lay there laughing and bitter and indifferent on the pillow, and he could not go away.
伯金笑了。杰拉德看着他躺在枕头上的脸，脸上带着笑意，苦涩而冷漠，他无法离开。

‘I don’t suppose you will see very much more of Gudrun, at least. She is a restless bird, she’ll be gone in a week or two,’ said Birkin.
“我不认为你会看到更多的古德伦，至少。她是一只不安分的鸟，一两周后她就会离开，”伯金说。

‘Where will she go?’
“她要去哪里？”

‘London, Paris, Rome—heaven knows. I always expect her to sheer off to Damascus or San Francisco; she’s a bird of paradise. God knows what she’s got to do with Beldover. It goes by contraries, like dreams.’
‘伦敦、巴黎、罗马——天知道。我总是希望她能直接前往大马士革或旧金山；她是天堂鸟。天知道她和贝尔多弗有什么关系。它是相反的，就像梦想一样。”

Gerald pondered for a few moments.
杰拉德沉思了一会儿。

‘How do you know her so well?’ he asked.
“你怎么这么了解她？”他问道。

‘I knew her in London,’ he replied, ‘in the Algernon Strange set. She’ll know about Pussum and Libidnikov and the rest—even if she doesn’t know them personally. She was never quite that set—more conventional, in a way. I’ve known her for two years, I suppose.’
“我在伦敦认识她，”他回答道，“在《阿尔吉农·斯特兰奇》的片场里。”她会了解普苏姆和利比德尼科夫以及其他人——即使她个人并不认识他们。在某种程度上，她从来都不是那样的——更传统。我想我已经认识她两年了。

‘And she makes money, apart from her teaching?’ asked Gerald.
“除了教学之外，她还能赚钱吗？”杰拉德问道。

‘Some—irregularly. She can sell her models. She has a certain reclame.’
“有些——不规则。”她可以出售她的模型。她有一定的恢复能力。

‘How much for?’
'多少钱？'

‘A guinea, ten guineas.’
“一畿尼，十畿尼。”

‘And are they good? What are they?’
‘他们好吗？这些是什么？'

‘I think sometimes they are marvellously good. That is hers, those two wagtails in Hermione’s boudoir—you’ve seen them—they are carved in wood and painted.’
“我认为有时他们非常棒。那是她的，赫敏闺房里的那两条鹡鸰——你见过它们——它们是用木头雕刻并彩绘的。

‘I thought it was savage carving again.’
“我以为又是野蛮雕刻。”

‘No, hers. That’s what they are—animals and birds, sometimes odd small people in everyday dress, really rather wonderful when they come off. They have a sort of funniness that is quite unconscious and subtle.’
‘不，是她的。这就是它们——动物和鸟类，有时穿着日常服装的奇怪小人物，当它们脱下来时真的相当美妙。他们有一种无意识和微妙的幽默感。

‘She might be a well-known artist one day?’ mused Gerald.
“有一天她可能会成为一位著名的艺术家？”杰拉德若有所思地说。

‘She might. But I think she won’t. She drops her art if anything else catches her. Her contrariness prevents her taking it seriously—she must never be too serious, she feels she might give herself away. And she won’t give herself away—she’s always on the defensive. That’s what I can’t stand about her type. By the way, how did things go off with Pussum after I left you? I haven’t heard anything.’
'她可能。但我想她不会。如果有其他事情抓住了她，她就会放弃她的艺术。她的矛盾让她无法认真对待这件事——她绝不能太认真，她觉得自己可能会暴露自己。她不会暴露自己——她总是处于守势。这就是我不能忍受她的类型。顺便问一下，我离开你之后，普苏姆的事情怎么样了？我什么也没听到。

‘Oh, rather disgusting. Halliday turned objectionable, and I only just saved myself from jumping in his stomach, in a real old-fashioned row.’
‘噢，真恶心。哈利迪变得很反感，而我只是避免了跳到他肚子里，一场真正的老式争吵。

Birkin was silent.
伯金沉默了。

‘Of course,’ he said, ‘Julius is somewhat insane. On the one hand he’s had religious mania, and on the other, he is fascinated by obscenity. Either he is a pure servant, washing the feet of Christ, or else he is making obscene drawings of Jesus—action and reaction—and between the two, nothing. He is really insane. He wants a pure lily, another girl, with a baby face, on the one hand, and on the other, he MUST have the Pussum, just to defile himself with her.’
“当然，”他说，“朱利叶斯有点疯狂。”一方面他有宗教狂热，另一方面他又对淫秽事物着迷。他要么是一个纯粹的仆人，为基督洗脚，要么他在对耶稣进行淫秽的描绘——行动和反应——而在两者之间，什么也不是。他真的疯了。一方面，他想要一个纯洁的百合，另一个女孩，长着一张娃娃脸，另一方面，他必须拥有普苏姆，只是为了用她来玷污自己。

‘That’s what I can’t make out,’ said Gerald. ‘Does he love her, the Pussum, or doesn’t he?’
“这是我无法理解的，”杰拉尔德说。 “他爱她吗，小猫咪，还是不爱？”

‘He neither does nor doesn’t. She is the harlot, the actual harlot of adultery to him. And he’s got a craving to throw himself into the filth of her. Then he gets up and calls on the name of the lily of purity, the baby-faced girl, and so enjoys himself all round. It’s the old story—action and reaction, and nothing between.’
‘他既不做也不不做。她就是那个妓女，真正与他通奸的妓女。他渴望将自己投入到她的污秽之中。然后起身，呼唤纯洁百合、娃娃脸女孩的名字，自得其乐。这就是老故事了——行动和反应，两者之间没有任何关系。

‘I don’t know,’ said Gerald, after a pause, ‘that he does insult the Pussum so very much. She strikes me as being rather foul.’
“我不知道，”杰拉尔德停顿了一下后说道，“他确实如此侮辱了猫咪。”她给我的印象是相当肮脏。

‘But I thought you liked her,’ exclaimed Birkin. ‘I always felt fond of her. I never had anything to do with her, personally, that’s true.’
“但我以为你喜欢她，”伯金惊呼道。 ‘我一直很喜欢她。就我个人而言，我从来没有和她有任何关系，这是真的。”

‘I liked her all right, for a couple of days,’ said Gerald. ‘But a week of her would have turned me over. There’s a certain smell about the skin of those women, that in the end is sickening beyond words—even if you like it at first.’
“我很喜欢她，有几天了，”杰拉尔德说。 “但是只要她一个星期，我就会彻底崩溃。”这些女人的皮肤上有一种特定的气味，最终令人难以言表的恶心——即使你一开始喜欢它。

‘I know,’ said Birkin. Then he added, rather fretfully, ‘But go to bed, Gerald. God knows what time it is.’
“我知道，”伯金说。然后他相当烦躁地补充道：“但是去睡觉吧，杰拉尔德。”天知道现在是什么时间了。

Gerald looked at his watch, and at length rose off the bed, and went to his room. But he returned in a few minutes, in his shirt.
杰拉德看了看手表，最后从床上起身，走进了自己的房间。但几分钟后他就穿着衬衫回来了。

‘One thing,’ he said, seating himself on the bed again. ‘We finished up rather stormily, and I never had time to give her anything.’
“有一件事，”他说，重新坐到床上。 “我们的结局相当暴躁，我从来没有时间给她任何东西。”

‘Money?’ said Birkin. ‘She’ll get what she wants from Halliday or from one of her acquaintances.’
“钱？”伯金说。 “她会从哈利迪或她的一位熟人那里得到她想要的东西。”

‘But then,’ said Gerald, ‘I’d rather give her her dues and settle the account.’
“但是，”杰拉尔德说，“我宁愿给她应得的钱，然后算账。”

‘She doesn’t care.’
“她不在乎。”

‘No, perhaps not. But one feels the account is left open, and one would rather it were closed.’
‘不，也许不是。但人们认为该账户仍处于开放状态，而人们宁愿将其关闭。

‘Would you?’ said Birkin. He was looking at the white legs of Gerald, as the latter sat on the side of the bed in his shirt. They were white-skinned, full, muscular legs, handsome and decided. Yet they moved Birkin with a sort of pathos, tenderness, as if they were childish.
“你愿意吗？”伯金说。他看着杰拉尔德的白腿，后者穿着衬衫坐在床边。他们皮肤白皙，双腿丰满，肌肉发达，英俊而决绝。然而，它们却以一种悲怆、温柔的方式打动了伯金，就好像它们很孩子气一样。

‘I think I’d rather close the account,’ said Gerald, repeating himself vaguely.
“我想我宁愿关闭账户，”杰拉德含糊地重复了一遍。

‘It doesn’t matter one way or another,’ said Birkin.
“无论如何，这并不重要，”伯金说。

‘You always say it doesn’t matter,’ said Gerald, a little puzzled, looking down at the face of the other man affectionately.
“你总是说没关系，”杰拉尔德有些困惑地说，低头深情地看着对方的脸。

‘Neither does it,’ said Birkin.
“也不是，”伯金说。

‘But she was a decent sort, really—‘
“但她是一个正派的人，真的——”

‘Render unto Caesarina the things that are Caesarina’s,’ said Birkin, turning aside. It seemed to him Gerald was talking for the sake of talking. ‘Go away, it wearies me—it’s too late at night,’ he said.
“凯萨琳娜的东西就归还给凯萨琳娜。”伯金转身说道。在他看来，杰拉尔德似乎是为了说话而说话。 “走吧，这让我很累——夜已经太晚了，”他说。

‘I wish you’d tell me something that DID matter,’ said Gerald, looking down all the time at the face of the other man, waiting for something. But Birkin turned his face aside.
“我希望你能告诉我一些真正重要的事情，”杰拉尔德说道，他一直低着头看着另一个人的脸，等待着什么。但伯金却把脸扭到一边。

‘All right then, go to sleep,’ said Gerald, and he laid his hand affectionately on the other man’s shoulder, and went away.
“好吧，去睡觉吧，”杰拉德说道，然后他亲切地把手放在另一个人的肩膀上，然后就走开了。

In the morning when Gerald awoke and heard Birkin move, he called out: ‘I still think I ought to give the Pussum ten pounds.’
早上，当杰拉德醒来并听到伯金的动静时，他喊道：“我仍然认为我应该给这只小猫十英镑。”

‘Oh God!’ said Birkin, ‘don’t be so matter-of-fact. Close the account in your own soul, if you like. It is there you can’t close it.’
“天哪！”伯金说，“别这么实事求是。如果你愿意的话，可以关闭你自己灵魂中的账户。它就在那里，你无法关闭它。

‘How do you know I can’t?’
“你怎么知道我不能？”

‘Knowing you.’
“认识你。”

Gerald meditated for some moments.
杰拉尔德沉思了一会儿。

‘It seems to me the right thing to do, you know, with the Pussums, is to pay them.’
“在我看来，对普苏姆一家来说，正确的做法就是付钱给他们。”

‘And the right thing for mistresses: keep them. And the right thing for wives: live under the same roof with them. Integer vitae scelerisque purus—‘ said Birkin.
“对于情妇来说正确的事情是：留住她们。对于妻子来说，正确的事情是：与她们住在同一屋檐下。 Integer vitae scelerisque purus——”伯金说道。

‘There’s no need to be nasty about it,’ said Gerald.
杰拉德说：“没有必要对此感到不快。”

‘It bores me. I’m not interested in your peccadilloes.’
‘这让我感到厌烦。我对你的过失不感兴趣。

‘And I don’t care whether you are or not—I am.’
“我不在乎你是否是——我是。”

The morning was again sunny. The maid had been in and brought the water, and had drawn the curtains. Birkin, sitting up in bed, looked lazily and pleasantly out on the park, that was so green and deserted, romantic, belonging to the past. He was thinking how lovely, how sure, how formed, how final all the things of the past were—the lovely accomplished past—this house, so still and golden, the park slumbering its centuries of peace. And then, what a snare and a delusion, this beauty of static things—what a horrible, dead prison Breadalby really was, what an intolerable confinement, the peace! Yet it was better than the sordid scrambling conflict of the present. If only one might create the future after one’s own heart—for a little pure truth, a little unflinching application of simple truth to life, the heart cried out ceaselessly.
早上又是阳光明媚的一天。女仆进来送水，拉上窗帘。伯金从床上坐起来，慵懒而愉悦地看着外面的公园，那是那样的绿意盎然，荒凉，浪漫，属于过去。他在想，过去的所有事情是多么可爱，多么确定，多么成形，多么最终——可爱的过去——这座房子，如此安静，金色，公园沉睡了几个世纪的宁静。然后，这静态事物的美丽是多么的陷阱和错觉——布雷多尔比实际上是一个多么可怕、死气沉沉的监狱，多么难以忍受的监禁，多么平静！但这比现在肮脏的争夺冲突要好。如果一个人能够按照自己的心创造未来就好了——为了一点点纯粹的真理，为了一点点在生活中坚定不移地运用简单的真理，内心不断地呼喊着。

‘I can’t see what you will leave me at all, to be interested in,’ came Gerald’s voice from the lower room. ‘Neither the Pussums, nor the mines, nor anything else.’
“我根本看不出你会给我留下什么让我感兴趣的东西，”杰拉德的声音从下层房间里传来。 “既不是普苏姆，也不是地雷，也不是其他任何东西。”

‘You be interested in what you can, Gerald. Only I’m not interested myself,’ said Birkin.
“你对你能做的事情感兴趣，杰拉德。只是我自己不感兴趣，”伯金说。

‘What am I to do at all, then?’ came Gerald’s voice.
“那我该怎么办呢？”杰拉德的声音传来。

‘What you like. What am I to do myself?’
'你喜欢什么。我自己该怎么办？

In the silence Birkin could feel Gerald musing this fact.
在沉默中，伯金能感觉到杰拉尔德正在思考这个事实。

‘I’m blest if I know,’ came the good-humoured answer.
“如果我知道的话，那就太好了。”他幽默地回答道。

‘You see,’ said Birkin, ‘part of you wants the Pussum, and nothing but the Pussum, part of you wants the mines, the business, and nothing but the business—and there you are—all in bits—‘
“你看，”伯金说，“你的一部分想要普苏姆，除了普苏姆什么也不想要，你的一部分想要矿山、生意，除了生意什么也不想——而你就在那里——一切都是零散的——”

‘And part of me wants something else,’ said Gerald, in a queer, quiet, real voice.
“我的一部分想要别的东西，”杰拉德用一种奇怪、安静、真实的声音说道。

‘What?’ said Birkin, rather surprised.
“什么？”伯金颇为惊讶地说。

‘That’s what I hoped you could tell me,’ said Gerald.
“这就是我希望你能告诉我的，”杰拉尔德说。

There was a silence for some time.
一阵沉默。

‘I can’t tell you—I can’t find my own way, let alone yours. You might marry,’ Birkin replied.
“我不能告诉你——我找不到自己的路，更不用说你的了。你可能会结婚，”伯金回答道。

‘Who—the Pussum?’ asked Gerald.
“谁——小猫咪？”杰拉德问道。

‘Perhaps,’ said Birkin. And he rose and went to the window.
“也许吧，”伯金说。他站起身来，走到窗前。

‘That is your panacea,’ said Gerald. ‘But you haven’t even tried it on yourself yet, and you are sick enough.’
“那是你的灵丹妙药，”杰拉尔德说。 “但你还没试过，你就已经够恶心了。”

‘I am,’ said Birkin. ‘Still, I shall come right.’
“我是，”伯金说。 “不过，我还是会来的。”

‘Through marriage?’
“通过婚姻？”

‘Yes,’ Birkin answered obstinately.
“是的，”伯金固执地回答。

‘And no,’ added Gerald. ‘No, no, no, my boy.’
“不，”杰拉德补充道。 “不，不，不，我的孩子。”

There was a silence between them, and a strange tension of hostility. They always kept a gap, a distance between them, they wanted always to be free each of the other. Yet there was a curious heart-straining towards each other.
他们之间一片沉默，还有一种奇怪的敌意紧张。他们之间总是保持着距离，他们总是希望彼此能够自由。然而彼此之间却有一种好奇的心紧张。

‘Salvator femininus,’ said Gerald, satirically.
“萨尔瓦多女性，”杰拉尔德讽刺地说。

‘Why not?’ said Birkin.
“为什么不呢？”伯金说。

‘No reason at all,’ said Gerald, ‘if it really works. But whom will you marry?’
“根本没有理由，”杰拉尔德说，“如果它真的有效的话。”但你会嫁给谁呢？

‘A woman,’ said Birkin.
“一个女人，”伯金说。

‘Good,’ said Gerald.
“很好，”杰拉尔德说。

Birkin and Gerald were the last to come down to breakfast. Hermione liked everybody to be early. She suffered when she felt her day was diminished, she felt she had missed her life. She seemed to grip the hours by the throat, to force her life from them. She was rather pale and ghastly, as if left behind, in the morning. Yet she had her power, her will was strangely pervasive. With the entrance of the two young men a sudden tension was felt.
伯金和杰拉德是最后一个下来吃早餐的。赫敏希望每个人都早到。当她觉得自己的日子减少了，她觉得自己已经错过了自己的生活时，她感到很痛苦。她似乎掐住了时间的喉咙，强行夺走她的生命。她的脸色苍白而可怕，就像早上被遗忘的一样。然而她有她的力量，她的意志奇怪地无处不在。随着两个年轻人的进来，气氛突然变得紧张起来。

She lifted her face, and said, in her amused sing-song:
她抬起脸，用她有趣的歌声说道：

‘Good morning! Did you sleep well? I’m so glad.’
'早上好！你睡的好吗？我很高兴。'

And she turned away, ignoring them. Birkin, who knew her well, saw that she intended to discount his existence.
然后她转身走开，不理会他们。伯金很了解她，看出她有意贬低他的存在。

‘Will you take what you want from the sideboard?’ said Alexander, in a voice slightly suggesting disapprobation. ‘I hope the things aren’t cold. Oh no! Do you mind putting out the flame under the chafingdish, Rupert? Thank you.’
“你能从餐具柜里拿走你想要的东西吗？”亚历山大说道，语气中略带不满。 “我希望事情不冷。不好了！鲁珀特，你介意把火锅下面的火灭掉吗？谢谢。'

Even Alexander was rather authoritative where Hermione was cool. He took his tone from her, inevitably. Birkin sat down and looked at the table. He was so used to this house, to this room, to this atmosphere, through years of intimacy, and now he felt in complete opposition to it all, it had nothing to do with him. How well he knew Hermione, as she sat there, erect and silent and somewhat bemused, and yet so potent, so powerful! He knew her statically, so finally, that it was almost like a madness. It was difficult to believe one was not mad, that one was not a figure in the hall of kings in some Egyptian tomb, where the dead all sat immemorial and tremendous. How utterly he knew Joshua Mattheson, who was talking in his harsh, yet rather mincing voice, endlessly, endlessly, always with a strong mentality working, always interesting, and yet always known, everything he said known beforehand, however novel it was, and clever. Alexander the up-to-date host, so bloodlessly free-and-easy, Fraulein so prettily chiming in just as she should, the little Italian Countess taking notice of everybody, only playing her little game, objective and cold, like a weasel watching everything, and extracting her own amusement, never giving herself in the slightest; then Miss Bradley, heavy and rather subservient, treated with cool, almost amused contempt by Hermione, and therefore slighted by everybody—how known it all was, like a game with the figures set out, the same figures, the Queen of chess, the knights, the pawns, the same now as they were hundreds of years ago, the same figures moving round in one of the innumerable permutations that make up the game. But the game is known, its going on is like a madness, it is so exhausted.
就连亚历山大也相当有权威，而赫敏却很酷。他不可避免地模仿了她的语气。伯金坐下来看着桌子。经过多年的亲密接触，他已经习惯了这个房子，习惯了这个房间，习惯了这种气氛，而现在他却觉得这一切完全对立，与他无关。他多么了解赫敏，因为她坐在那里，笔直、沉默、有些困惑，但又如此有力、如此有力！他静态地认识了她，所以最终，这几乎就像是疯狂。很难相信一个人没有疯，也很难相信一个人不是某个埃及坟墓中国王大厅里的人物，死者都坐在那里，远古而伟大。他多么了解约书亚·马特森，他用刺耳而又装腔作势的声音说话，没完没了，没完没了，总是带着一种强大的心态在工作，总是很有趣，但总是众所周知，他所说的一切都是事先知道的，无论多么新颖，而且聪明的。亚历山大是最新的主人，如此冷血无情，自由自在，小姐如此漂亮地插话，她应该如此，意大利小伯爵夫人注意到每个人，只玩她的小游戏，客观而冷漠，像一只黄鼠狼在观看一切事情，她都从中汲取乐趣，从不付出丝毫的努力。然后是布拉德利小姐，身材沉重，相当顺从，受到赫敏冷酷的、近乎逗乐的轻蔑对待，因此受到每个人的轻视——这一切是多么众所周知，就像一场游戏，棋子摆好了，同样的棋子，国际象棋皇后，骑士、棋子，现在和几百年前一样，同样的人物以构成游戏的无数排列之一移动。但众所周知，比赛进行得就像一场疯狂，让人筋疲力尽。

There was Gerald, an amused look on his face; the game pleased him. There was Gudrun, watching with steady, large, hostile eyes; the game fascinated her, and she loathed it. There was Ursula, with a slightly startled look on her face, as if she were hurt, and the pain were just outside her consciousness.
杰拉尔德在那儿，脸上带着有趣的表情。这场比赛让他很高兴。古德伦在那儿，用坚定、充满敌意的大眼睛注视着。这个游戏让她着迷，但她又讨厌它。那里是乌苏拉，她的脸上带着些许惊讶的神色，仿佛受到了伤害，而疼痛却是她意识不到的。

Suddenly Birkin got up and went out.
突然，伯金起身走了出去。

‘That’s enough,’ he said to himself involuntarily.
“够了。”他不由自主地对自己说。

Hermione knew his motion, though not in her consciousness. She lifted her heavy eyes and saw him lapse suddenly away, on a sudden, unknown tide, and the waves broke over her. Only her indomitable will remained static and mechanical, she sat at the table making her musing, stray remarks. But the darkness had covered her, she was like a ship that has gone down. It was finished for her too, she was wrecked in the darkness. Yet the unfailing mechanism of her will worked on, she had that activity.
赫敏知道他的动作，尽管她没有意识到。她抬起沉重的眼睛，看到他突然消失，就像突然出现的、未知的潮水一样，海浪淹没了她。只是她那不屈不挠的意志依然静止而机械，她坐在桌旁，若有所思，漫无目的地说着什么。但黑暗笼罩了她，她就像一艘沉没的船。对她来说，一切也都结束了，她在黑暗中被毁坏了。然而，她的意志的可靠机制仍在发挥作用，她有这种活动。

‘Shall we bathe this morning?’ she said, suddenly looking at them all.
“我们今天早上要洗澡吗？”她突然看着他们所有人说道。

‘Splendid,’ said Joshua. ‘It is a perfect morning.’
“太棒了，”约书亚说。 “这是一个完美的早晨。”

‘Oh, it is beautiful,’ said Fraulein.
“哦，真漂亮，”弗劳林说。

‘Yes, let us bathe,’ said the Italian woman.
“是的，我们去洗澡吧，”意大利女人说。

‘We have no bathing suits,’ said Gerald.
“我们没有泳衣，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Have mine,’ said Alexander. ‘I must go to church and read the lessons. They expect me.’
“拿我的吧，”亚历山大说。 “我必须去教堂读书。他们期待我。

‘Are you a Christian?’ asked the Italian Countess, with sudden interest.
“你是基督徒吗？”意大利伯爵夫人突然感兴趣地问道。

‘No,’ said Alexander. ‘I’m not. But I believe in keeping up the old institutions.’
“不，”亚历山大说。 '我不是。但我相信要维持旧制度。”

‘They are so beautiful,’ said Fraulein daintily.
“它们真漂亮，”弗劳林优雅地说。

‘Oh, they are,’ cried Miss Bradley.
“哦，是的，”布拉德利小姐喊道。

They all trailed out on to the lawn. It was a sunny, soft morning in early summer, when life ran in the world subtly, like a reminiscence. The church bells were ringing a little way off, not a cloud was in the sky, the swans were like lilies on the water below, the peacocks walked with long, prancing steps across the shadow and into the sunshine of the grass. One wanted to swoon into the by-gone perfection of it all.
他们全都走到草坪上。那是初夏一个阳光明媚、柔和的早晨，生命在世间微妙地运行，就像一段回忆。教堂的钟声在不远处响起，天空万里无云，天鹅就像下面水面上的百合花，孔雀迈着长长的步伐，昂首阔步地穿过阴影，走进阳光下的草地。人们想要沉迷于这一切过去的完美之中。

‘Good-bye,’ called Alexander, waving his gloves cheerily, and he disappeared behind the bushes, on his way to church.
“再见，”亚历山大高兴地挥舞着手套，然后消失在灌木丛后面，走在去教堂的路上。

‘Now,’ said Hermione, ‘shall we all bathe?’
“现在，”赫敏说，“我们都去洗澡吧？”

‘I won’t,’ said Ursula.
“我不会，”乌苏拉说。

‘You don’t want to?’ said Hermione, looking at her slowly.
“你不想吗？”赫敏慢慢地看着她说道。

‘No. I don’t want to,’ said Ursula.
'不。我不想，”乌苏拉说。

‘Nor I,’ said Gudrun.
“我也没有，”古德伦说。

‘What about my suit?’ asked Gerald.
“我的套装怎么样？”杰拉德问道。

‘I don’t know,’ laughed Hermione, with an odd, amused intonation. ‘Will a handkerchief do—a large handkerchief?’
“我不知道，”赫敏用一种奇怪而有趣的语调笑道。 “一块手帕可以吗——一块大手帕？”

‘That will do,’ said Gerald.
“那就行了，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Come along then,’ sang Hermione.
“那就来吧，”赫敏唱道。

The first to run across the lawn was the little Italian, small and like a cat, her white legs twinkling as she went, ducking slightly her head, that was tied in a gold silk kerchief. She tripped through the gate and down the grass, and stood, like a tiny figure of ivory and bronze, at the water’s edge, having dropped off her towelling, watching the swans, which came up in surprise. Then out ran Miss Bradley, like a large, soft plum in her dark-blue suit. Then Gerald came, a scarlet silk kerchief round his loins, his towels over his arms. He seemed to flaunt himself a little in the sun, lingering and laughing, strolling easily, looking white but natural in his nakedness. Then came Sir Joshua, in an overcoat, and lastly Hermione, striding with stiff grace from out of a great mantle of purple silk, her head tied up in purple and gold. Handsome was her stiff, long body, her straight-stepping white legs, there was a static magnificence about her as she let the cloak float loosely away from her striding. She crossed the lawn like some strange memory, and passed slowly and statelily towards the water.
第一个跑过草坪的是意大利小个子，她个子小，像只猫，雪白的双腿在跑时闪闪发光，微微低着头，头上系着一条金色的丝巾。她跌跌撞撞地穿过大门，走下草地，像一个象牙和青铜制成的小雕像一样，站在水边，放下毛巾，看着天鹅，它们惊讶地游上来。然后布拉德利小姐跑了出来，她穿着深蓝色的西装，像一朵又大又软的李子。然后杰拉尔德来了，腰间围着一条猩红色的丝巾，胳膊上搭着毛巾。他在阳光下似乎有点炫耀自己，徘徊着，笑着，轻松地漫步，赤身裸体，看上去苍白却自然。然后穿着大衣的约书亚爵士走了过来，最后是赫敏，她披着一件巨大的紫色丝绸斗篷，迈着僵硬的优雅步伐，头上绑着紫色和金色的帽子。英俊的是她僵硬修长的身体，迈着笔直白皙的双腿，当她让斗篷松松地飘离她的大步时，她身上有一种静态的壮丽。她像某种奇怪的记忆一样穿过草坪，缓慢而庄严地走向水边。

There were three ponds, in terraces descending the valley, large and smooth and beautiful, lying in the sun. The water ran over a little stone wall, over small rocks, splashing down from one pond to the level below. The swans had gone out on to the opposite bank, the reeds smelled sweet, a faint breeze touched the skin.
那里有三个池塘，沿着山谷呈梯田状，又大又平又漂亮，躺在阳光下。水流过一堵小石墙，流过小岩石，从一个池塘溅落到下面的水平面。天鹅们已经飞到了对岸，芦苇散发着甜香，微风拂过肌肤。

Gerald had dived in, after Sir Joshua, and had swum to the end of the pond. There he climbed out and sat on the wall. There was a dive, and the little Countess was swimming like a rat, to join him. They both sat in the sun, laughing and crossing their arms on their breasts. Sir Joshua swam up to them, and stood near them, up to his arm-pits in the water. Then Hermione and Miss Bradley swam over, and they sat in a row on the embankment.
杰拉德跟随约书亚爵士跳入水中，游到了池塘的尽头。他从那里爬出来，坐在墙上。潜入水中，小伯爵夫人像老鼠一样游向他的身边。他们俩坐在阳光下，笑着，双臂交叉在胸前。约书亚爵士游到他们身边，站在他们附近，水深没过他的腋窝。然后赫敏和布拉德利小姐游了过来，她们在堤岸上坐成一排。

‘Aren’t they terrifying? Aren’t they really terrifying?’ said Gudrun. ‘Don’t they look saurian? They are just like great lizards. Did you ever see anything like Sir Joshua? But really, Ursula, he belongs to the primeval world, when great lizards crawled about.’
‘他们不可怕吗？它们真的不可怕吗？”古德伦说。 ‘它们看起来不像蜥蜴吗？他们就像巨大的蜥蜴。你见过像约书亚爵士这样的人吗？但实际上，乌苏拉，他属于原始世界，那里有巨大的蜥蜴爬行。

Gudrun looked in dismay on Sir Joshua, who stood up to the breast in the water, his long, greyish hair washed down into his eyes, his neck set into thick, crude shoulders. He was talking to Miss Bradley, who, seated on the bank above, plump and big and wet, looked as if she might roll and slither in the water almost like one of the slithering sealions in the Zoo.
古德伦沮丧地看着约书亚爵士，他在水中直立到胸口，长长的灰白头发被冲刷到眼睛里，脖子埋在粗壮的肩膀里。他正在和布拉德利小姐说话，布拉德利小姐坐在上面的河岸上，胖乎乎的，又大又湿，看起来好像她会在水中打滚滑行，就像动物园里滑行的海狮一样。

Ursula watched in silence. Gerald was laughing happily, between Hermione and the Italian. He reminded her of Dionysos, because his hair was really yellow, his figure so full and laughing. Hermione, in her large, stiff, sinister grace, leaned near him, frightening, as if she were not responsible for what she might do. He knew a certain danger in her, a convulsive madness. But he only laughed the more, turning often to the little Countess, who was flashing up her face at him.
乌苏拉静静地看着。杰拉德在赫敏和意大利人之间开心地大笑。他让她想起了狄俄尼索斯，因为他的头发真的是黄的，他的身材那么丰满，而且在笑。赫敏以她那高大、僵硬、险恶的优雅，靠在他身边，令人恐惧，仿佛她对自己可能做的事不负有责任。他知道她身上有某种危险，一种痉挛性的疯狂。但他却笑得越多，时不时地转向小伯爵夫人，她的脸正向他闪现。

They all dropped into the water, and were swimming together like a shoal of seals. Hermione was powerful and unconscious in the water, large and slow and powerful. Palestra was quick and silent as a water rat, Gerald wavered and flickered, a white natural shadow. Then, one after the other, they waded out, and went up to the house.
他们都掉进了水里，像一群海豹一样一起游泳。赫敏在水里很强大，但毫无意识，体型庞大，动作缓慢，但力量却很大。帕莱斯特拉像水鼠一样敏捷而安静，杰拉德则摇摆不定、闪烁不定，就像一个白色的自然影子。然后，他们一前一后涉水而出，朝房子走去。

But Gerald lingered a moment to speak to Gudrun.
但杰拉德又犹豫了一会儿才跟古德伦说话。

‘You don’t like the water?’ he said.
“你不喜欢水吗？”他说。

She looked at him with a long, slow inscrutable look, as he stood before her negligently, the water standing in beads all over his skin.
她用一种漫长而神秘的眼神看着他，他漫不经心地站在她面前，水珠在他的皮肤上凝结成水珠。

‘I like it very much,’ she replied.
“我非常喜欢它，”她回答道。

He paused, expecting some sort of explanation.
他停了下来，期待着某种解释。

‘And you swim?’
“你会游泳吗？”

‘Yes, I swim.’
“是的，我会游泳。”

Still he would not ask her why she would not go in then. He could feel something ironic in her. He walked away, piqued for the first time.
但他还是不会问她为什么不进去。他能感觉到她身上有某种讽刺意味。他走开了，第一次感到生气。

‘Why wouldn’t you bathe?’ he asked her again, later, when he was once more the properly-dressed young Englishman.
“你为什么不洗澡？”后来，当他再次成为那个衣着得体的年轻英国人时，他又问她。

She hesitated a moment before answering, opposing his persistence.
她犹豫了一下才回答，反对他的坚持。

‘Because I didn’t like the crowd,’ she replied.
“因为我不喜欢人群，”她回答道。

He laughed, her phrase seemed to re-echo in his consciousness. The flavour of her slang was piquant to him. Whether he would or not, she signified the real world to him. He wanted to come up to her standards, fulfil her expectations. He knew that her criterion was the only one that mattered. The others were all outsiders, instinctively, whatever they might be socially. And Gerald could not help it, he was bound to strive to come up to her criterion, fulfil her idea of a man and a human-being.
他笑了，她的这句话似乎在他的意识里回响。她的俚语对他来说很辛辣。无论他愿意与否，她对他来说都意味着现实世界。他想达到她的标准，满足她的期望。他知道她的标准是唯一重要的。从本能上来说，其他人都是局外人，无论他们的社会地位如何。而杰拉德也无可奈何，他一定要努力达到她的标准，实现她对男人、为人的理想。

After lunch, when all the others had withdrawn, Hermione and Gerald and Birkin lingered, finishing their talk. There had been some discussion, on the whole quite intellectual and artificial, about a new state, a new world of man. Supposing this old social state WERE broken and destroyed, then, out of the chaos, what then?
午饭后，当其他人都退去时，赫敏、杰拉德和伯金仍在逗留，结束了他们的谈话。曾经有过一些关于人类新国家、新世界的讨论，总体上是相当理智和人为的。假设这个旧的社会状态被打破和摧毁，那么，摆脱混乱，然后呢？

The great social idea, said Sir Joshua, was the SOCIAL equality of man. No, said Gerald, the idea was, that every man was fit for his own little bit of a task—let him do that, and then please himself. The unifying principle was the work in hand. Only work, the business of production, held men together. It was mechanical, but then society WAS a mechanism. Apart from work they were isolated, free to do as they liked.
约书亚爵士说，伟大的社会理念是人的社会平等。不，杰拉德说，我们的想法是，每个人都适合完成自己的小任务——让他去做，然后取悦自己。统一原则是手头的工作。只有工作，即生产事业，才能将人们团结在一起。它是机械的，但社会是一种机制。除了工作之外，他们与世隔绝，可以自由地做自己喜欢的事。

‘Oh!’ cried Gudrun. ‘Then we shan’t have names any more—we shall be like the Germans, nothing but Herr Obermeister and Herr Untermeister. I can imagine it—‘I am Mrs Colliery-Manager Crich—I am Mrs Member-of-Parliament Roddice. I am Miss Art-Teacher Brangwen.’ Very pretty that.’
“哦！”古珍叫道。 “那么我们就不再有名字了——我们就会像德国人一样，除了奥伯迈斯特先生和安特迈斯特先生之外什么都没有。我可以想象——“我是煤矿经理克里奇夫人——我是议会议员罗迪斯夫人。”我是艺术老师布兰文小姐。’非常漂亮。’

‘Things would work very much better, Miss Art-Teacher Brangwen,’ said Gerald.
“事情会好得多，艺术老师布兰文小姐，”杰拉尔德说。

‘What things, Mr Colliery-Manager Crich? The relation between you and me, PAR EXEMPLE?’
“什么事情，煤矿经理克里奇先生？你和我之间的关系，例如？

‘Yes, for example,’ cried the Italian. ‘That which is between men and women—!’
“是的，例如，”意大利人喊道。 「男人和女人之间的事情——！」

‘That is non-social,’ said Birkin, sarcastically.
“那是非社交的，”伯金讽刺地说。

‘Exactly,’ said Gerald. ‘Between me and a woman, the social question does not enter. It is my own affair.’
“完全正确，”杰拉尔德说。 “在我和一个女人之间，社会问题不存在。这是我自己的事。

‘A ten-pound note on it,’ said Birkin.
“上面有一张十英镑的钞票，”伯金说。

‘You don’t admit that a woman is a social being?’ asked Ursula of Gerald.
“你不承认女人是社会存在吗？”乌苏拉问杰拉德。

‘She is both,’ said Gerald. ‘She is a social being, as far as society is concerned. But for her own private self, she is a free agent, it is her own affair, what she does.’
“她两者都是，”杰拉尔德说。 “就社会而言，她是一个社会存在。但就她个人而言，她是一个自由人，她做什么都是她自己的事。”

‘But won’t it be rather difficult to arrange the two halves?’ asked Ursula.
“但是安排这两半会不会很困难？”乌苏拉问。

‘Oh no,’ replied Gerald. ‘They arrange themselves naturally—we see it now, everywhere.’
“哦，不，”杰拉德回答道。 “它们自然地排列着——我们现在随处可见。”

‘Don’t you laugh so pleasantly till you’re out of the wood,’ said Birkin.
“在你走出困境之前，不要笑得这么开心，”伯金说。

Gerald knitted his brows in momentary irritation.
杰拉尔德一时恼怒地皱起了眉头。

‘Was I laughing?’ he said.
“我在笑吗？”他说。

‘IF,’ said Hermione at last, ‘we could only realise, that in the SPIRIT we are all one, all equal in the spirit, all brothers there—the rest wouldn’t matter, there would be no more of this carping and envy and this struggle for power, which destroys, only destroys.’
“如果，”赫敏最后说道，“我们只能认识到，在精神上我们都是一体的，在精神上都是平等的，都是兄弟——其余的都无关紧要，不会再有这种吹毛求疵和批评了。”嫉妒和权力斗争只会带来破坏。”

This speech was received in silence, and almost immediately the party rose from the table. But when the others had gone, Birkin turned round in bitter declamation, saying:
这场演讲在一片安静中被接受，几乎立刻，大家就从桌边起身。但当其他人都走后，伯金转过身来，尖刻地说道：

‘It is just the opposite, just the contrary, Hermione. We are all different and unequal in spirit—it is only the SOCIAL differences that are based on accidental material conditions. We are all abstractly or mathematically equal, if you like. Every man has hunger and thirst, two eyes, one nose and two legs. We’re all the same in point of number. But spiritually, there is pure difference and neither equality nor inequality counts. It is upon these two bits of knowledge that you must found a state. Your democracy is an absolute lie—your brotherhood of man is a pure falsity, if you apply it further than the mathematical abstraction. We all drank milk first, we all eat bread and meat, we all want to ride in motor-cars—therein lies the beginning and the end of the brotherhood of man. But no equality.
“事实恰恰相反，恰恰相反，赫敏。我们在精神上都是不同和不平等的——只是基于偶然的物质条件的社会差异。如果你愿意的话，我们在抽象或数学上都是平等的。每个人都有饥渴，两只眼睛，一只鼻子，两条腿。我们在数量上都是一样的。但在精神上，存在着纯粹的差异，平等和不平等都无关紧要。正是基于这两种知识，你必须建立一种状态。你们的民主是一个绝对的谎言——如果你们比数学抽象更进一步地应用它，你们的人类兄弟情谊就是纯粹的虚假。我们都先喝牛奶，我们都吃面包和肉，我们都想坐汽车——这就是人类兄弟情谊的开始和结束。但没有平等。

‘But I, myself, who am myself, what have I to do with equality with any other man or woman? In the spirit, I am as separate as one star is from another, as different in quality and quantity. Establish a state on THAT. One man isn’t any better than another, not because they are equal, but because they are intrinsically OTHER, that there is no term of comparison. The minute you begin to compare, one man is seen to be far better than another, all the inequality you can imagine is there by nature. I want every man to have his share in the world’s goods, so that I am rid of his importunity, so that I can tell him: ‘Now you’ve got what you want—you’ve got your fair share of the world’s gear. Now, you one-mouthed fool, mind yourself and don’t obstruct me.‘‘
“但是我，我自己，我自己，与其他男人或女人的平等有什么关系呢？在精神上，我就像一颗星星与另一颗星星一样分离，在质量和数量上都不同。建立一个国家。一个人并不比另一个人更好，不是因为他们平等，而是因为他们本质上是不同的，没有可比性。从你开始比较的那一刻起，一个人就被认为比另一个人优秀得多，所有你能想象到的不平等都是天生存在的。我希望每个人都能在世界上的物品中占有自己的一份，这样我就可以摆脱他的纠缠，这样我就可以告诉他：“现在你已经得到了你想要的东西——你已经得到了你应得的世界上的装备” 。现在，你这个独嘴傻瓜，管好自己，不要妨碍我。”

Hermione was looking at him with leering eyes, along her cheeks. He could feel violent waves of hatred and loathing of all he said, coming out of her. It was dynamic hatred and loathing, coming strong and black out of the unconsciousness. She heard his words in her unconscious self, CONSCIOUSLY she was as if deafened, she paid no heed to them.
赫敏用斜视的目光沿着脸颊看着他。他能感觉到从她身上涌出强烈的仇恨和厌恶他所说的一切。这是动态的仇恨和厌恶，从无意识中强烈而黑暗地涌出来。她在无意识中听到了他的话，意识上她好像聋了，她没有在意。

‘It SOUNDS like megalomania, Rupert,’ said Gerald, genially.
“这听起来像是狂妄自大，鲁珀特，”杰拉德和蔼地说。

Hermione gave a queer, grunting sound. Birkin stood back.
赫敏发出奇怪的咕哝声。伯金往后退了一步。

‘Yes, let it,’ he said suddenly, the whole tone gone out of his voice, that had been so insistent, bearing everybody down. And he went away.
“是的，就这样吧，”他突然说道，他的语气完全消失了，他的声音如此坚持，让每个人都感到沮丧。然后他就走了。

But he felt, later, a little compunction. He had been violent, cruel with poor Hermione. He wanted to recompense her, to make it up. He had hurt her, he had been vindictive. He wanted to be on good terms with her again.
但后来他感到有点内疚。他对可怜的赫敏很暴力、残忍。他想补偿她，补偿她。他伤害了她，他报复了她。他想和她重新搞好关系。

He went into her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was sitting at her table writing letters. She lifted her face abstractedly when he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then she looked down at her paper again.
他走进她的闺房，那是一个偏远而又舒适的地方。她正坐在桌旁写信。当他进来时，她心不在焉地抬起脸，看着他走到沙发边坐下。然后她又低头看着她的报纸。

He took up a large volume which he had been reading before, and became minutely attentive to his author. His back was towards Hermione. She could not go on with her writing. Her whole mind was a chaos, darkness breaking in upon it, and herself struggling to gain control with her will, as a swimmer struggles with the swirling water. But in spite of her efforts she was borne down, darkness seemed to break over her, she felt as if her heart was bursting. The terrible tension grew stronger and stronger, it was most fearful agony, like being walled up.
他拿起一本他以前读过的大书，开始仔细地听着他的作者。他背对着赫敏。她无法继续写作。她的整个头脑一片混乱，黑暗袭来，她自己努力用自己的意志控制自己，就像游泳者在漩涡中挣扎一样。但尽管她竭尽全力，她还是被压了下来，黑暗似乎笼罩着她，她感觉自己的心仿佛要破裂。可怕的紧张越来越强烈，那是最可怕的痛苦，就像被围墙堵住一样。

And then she realised that his presence was the wall, his presence was destroying her. Unless she could break out, she must die most fearfully, walled up in horror. And he was the wall. She must break down the wall—she must break him down before her, the awful obstruction of him who obstructed her life to the last. It must be done, or she must perish most horribly.
然后她意识到他的存在就是墙，他的存在正在摧毁她。除非她能够逃脱，否则她一定会死得很惨，被恐惧围住。而他就是那堵墙。她必须推倒这堵墙——她必须推倒她面前的他，这个一直阻碍她生命的可怕障碍。必须这么做，否则她就会死得最惨。

Terribly shocks ran over her body, like shocks of electricity, as if many volts of electricity suddenly struck her down. She was aware of him sitting silently there, an unthinkable evil obstruction. Only this blotted out her mind, pressed out her very breathing, his silent, stooping back, the back of his head.
可怕的震动传遍了她的全身，如同触电一般，仿佛数伏的电流突然将她击倒。她意识到他静静地坐在那里，是一个难以想象的邪恶障碍。只有这样，她的思绪就被淹没了，她的呼吸也被压抑了，他沉默的、弯着腰的背影、他的后脑勺也被压抑了。

A terrible voluptuous thrill ran down her arms—she was going to know her voluptuous consummation. Her arms quivered and were strong, immeasurably and irresistibly strong. What delight, what delight in strength, what delirium of pleasure! She was going to have her consummation of voluptuous ecstasy at last. It was coming! In utmost terror and agony, she knew it was upon her now, in extremity of bliss. Her hand closed on a blue, beautiful ball of lapis lazuli that stood on her desk for a paper-weight. She rolled it round in her hand as she rose silently. Her heart was a pure flame in her breast, she was purely unconscious in ecstasy. She moved towards him and stood behind him for a moment in ecstasy. He, closed within the spell, remained motionless and unconscious.
一种可怕的性感快感顺着她的手臂流下来——她即将知道她性感的完美。她的手臂颤抖着，却很有力，强大到无法估量，无法抗拒。这是何等的喜悦，何等的力量喜悦，何等的狂喜！她终于要达到极致的狂喜了。它来了！在极度的恐惧和痛苦中，她知道现在她正处于极度的幸福之中。她的手握住了一个美丽的蓝色青金石球，它放在她的桌子上作为镇纸。她在手里把它转了一圈，默默地站了起来。她的心是胸中的一团纯洁的火焰，她完全沉浸在狂喜之中。她走向他，在他身后站了一会儿，欣喜若狂。他被咒语封闭，一动不动，失去知觉。

Then swiftly, in a flame that drenched down her body like fluid lightning and gave her a perfect, unutterable consummation, unutterable satisfaction, she brought down the ball of jewel stone with all her force, crash on his head. But her fingers were in the way and deadened the blow. Nevertheless, down went his head on the table on which his book lay, the stone slid aside and over his ear, it was one convulsion of pure bliss for her, lit up by the crushed pain of her fingers. But it was not somehow complete. She lifted her arm high to aim once more, straight down on the head that lay dazed on the table. She must smash it, it must be smashed before her ecstasy was consummated, fulfilled for ever. A thousand lives, a thousand deaths mattered nothing now, only the fulfilment of this perfect ecstasy.
然后迅速地，在一股如流动的闪电般浸透她身体的火焰中，给她一种完美的、难以言喻的圆满、难以言喻的满足感，她用尽全力将那颗宝石球打了下来，砸在了他的头上。但她的手指挡住了，减弱了这一击。然而，他的头低到了放着书的桌子上，石头滑到了一边，盖在了他的耳朵上，这对她来说是一种纯粹幸福的抽搐，被她手指压碎的疼痛所点燃。但它并不完整。她高举手臂，再次瞄准，直接瞄准了放在桌子上发呆的脑袋。她必须粉碎它，必须在她的狂喜得以圆满、永远实现之前粉碎它。一千次的生命，一千次的死亡现在已经不再重要，重要的是实现这种完美的狂喜。

She was not swift, she could only move slowly. A strong spirit in him woke him and made him lift his face and twist to look at her. Her arm was raised, the hand clasping the ball of lapis lazuli. It was her left hand, he realised again with horror that she was left-handed. Hurriedly, with a burrowing motion, he covered his head under the thick volume of Thucydides, and the blow came down, almost breaking his neck, and shattering his heart.
她的动作并不快，只能缓慢地移动。他体内的一股强大的精神唤醒了他，让他抬起头，扭过头来看着她。她的手臂举起，手握着青金石球。那是她的左手，他再次惊恐地意识到她是左撇子。连忙做出一个挖洞的动作，他把头埋在了厚厚的修昔底德书下，这一击轰然落下，几乎折断了他的脖子，也击碎了他的心。

He was shattered, but he was not afraid. Twisting round to face her he pushed the table over and got away from her. He was like a flask that is smashed to atoms, he seemed to himself that he was all fragments, smashed to bits. Yet his movements were perfectly coherent and clear, his soul was entire and unsurprised.
他心碎了，但他并不害怕。他转身面对她，推倒桌子，离开了她。他就像一个被粉碎成原子的烧瓶，他自己觉得自己已经是碎片，粉碎成碎片了。但他的动作却是连贯清晰，灵魂完整，毫不意外。

‘No you don’t, Hermione,’ he said in a low voice. ‘I don’t let you.’
“不，你不知道，赫敏，”他低声说道。 “我不让你这么做。”

He saw her standing tall and livid and attentive, the stone clenched tense in her hand.
他看到她站得很高，脸色铁青，全神贯注，手里紧握着石头。

‘Stand away and let me go,’ he said, drawing near to her.
“站开，让我走，”他靠近她说道。

As if pressed back by some hand, she stood away, watching him all the time without changing, like a neutralised angel confronting him.
仿佛被一只手按了回去，她站在一旁，始终没有改变地看着他，就像一个被中立的天使面对着他。

‘It is not good,’ he said, when he had gone past her. ‘It isn’t I who will die. You hear?’
“这不太好，”当他经过她身边时，他说道。 ‘会死的不是我。你听？'

He kept his face to her as he went out, lest she should strike again. While he was on his guard, she dared not move. And he was on his guard, she was powerless. So he had gone, and left her standing.
出去的时候他一直脸对着她，生怕她再次袭击。当他戒备的时候，她却不敢动。而他全心全意戒备，她却无能为力。于是他就走了，留下她站着。

She remained perfectly rigid, standing as she was for a long time. Then she staggered to the couch and lay down, and went heavily to sleep. When she awoke, she remembered what she had done, but it seemed to her, she had only hit him, as any woman might do, because he tortured her. She was perfectly right. She knew that, spiritually, she was right. In her own infallible purity, she had done what must be done. She was right, she was pure. A drugged, almost sinister religious expression became permanent on her face.
她保持着完全僵硬的姿势，站了很长一段时间。然后她摇摇晃晃地走到沙发上躺下，沉沉地睡着了。当她醒来时，她记起了自己所做的事，但在她看来，她只是打了他，就像任何女人都会做的那样，因为他折磨了她。她是完全正确的。她知道，从精神上来说，她是对的。她以自己绝对正确的纯洁性，做了必须做的事。她说得对，她很纯洁。她脸上永远挂着一种被下了药、近乎险恶的宗教表情。

Birkin, barely conscious, and yet perfectly direct in his motion, went out of the house and straight across the park, to the open country, to the hills. The brilliant day had become overcast, spots of rain were falling. He wandered on to a wild valley-side, where were thickets of hazel, many flowers, tufts of heather, and little clumps of young firtrees, budding with soft paws. It was rather wet everywhere, there was a stream running down at the bottom of the valley, which was gloomy, or seemed gloomy. He was aware that he could not regain his consciousness, that he was moving in a sort of darkness.
伯金几乎没有意识，但动作却非常直接，走出了房子，径直穿过公园，来到了空旷的乡村，来到了山上。原本晴朗的天气转阴了，小雨点点落下。他漫步到一片荒野的山谷边，那里有榛树丛、许多花朵、一簇簇石南花，还有一小丛年轻的冷杉树，它们的爪子已经发芽了。到处都是湿漉漉的，谷底有一条小溪流下来，阴森森的，或者说看起来阴森森的。他意识到自己无法恢复意识，他正在一种黑暗中移动。

Yet he wanted something. He was happy in the wet hillside, that was overgrown and obscure with bushes and flowers. He wanted to touch them all, to saturate himself with the touch of them all. He took off his clothes, and sat down naked among the primroses, moving his feet softly among the primroses, his legs, his knees, his arms right up to the arm-pits, lying down and letting them touch his belly, his breasts. It was such a fine, cool, subtle touch all over him, he seemed to saturate himself with their contact.
但他想要一些东西。他在潮湿的山坡上感到很高兴，山坡上长满了灌木和鲜花，显得杂乱无章。他想要触摸它们所有人，让自己被它们所有人的触摸所浸透。他脱掉衣服，赤身裸体地坐在报春花丛中，双脚在报春花丛中轻轻移动，腿、膝盖、手臂一直到腋窝，躺下让它们触碰他的腹部、他的胸部。他身上的触感是如此细腻、冰凉、微妙，他似乎沉浸在他们的接触中。

But they were too soft. He went through the long grass to a clump of young fir-trees, that were no higher than a man. The soft sharp boughs beat upon him, as he moved in keen pangs against them, threw little cold showers of drops on his belly, and beat his loins with their clusters of soft-sharp needles. There was a thistle which pricked him vividly, but not too much, because all his movements were too discriminate and soft. To lie down and roll in the sticky, cool young hyacinths, to lie on one’s belly and cover one’s back with handfuls of fine wet grass, soft as a breath, soft and more delicate and more beautiful than the touch of any woman; and then to sting one’s thigh against the living dark bristles of the fir-boughs; and then to feel the light whip of the hazel on one’s shoulders, stinging, and then to clasp the silvery birch-trunk against one’s breast, its smoothness, its hardness, its vital knots and ridges—this was good, this was all very good, very satisfying. Nothing else would do, nothing else would satisfy, except this coolness and subtlety of vegetation travelling into one’s blood. How fortunate he was, that there was this lovely, subtle, responsive vegetation, waiting for him, as he waited for it; how fulfilled he was, how happy!
但他们太软了。他穿过长长的草丛，来到一丛还不到一个人高的小枞树。当他在剧烈的疼痛中移动时，柔软而锋利的树枝敲打在他身上，将冰冷的水滴洒在他的腹部，并用一簇簇柔软锋利的针抽打他的腰部。有一根蓟刺在他身上，刺得很生动，但刺得不太厉害，因为他所有的动作都太分明、太柔和了。躺下，在黏糊糊、凉凉的风信子幼苗里打滚，趴着，背上盖上一把湿漉漉的细草，柔软如呼吸，比任何女人的抚摸都柔软、细腻、美丽；然后用大腿刺痛冷杉树枝上鲜亮的黑色鬃毛；然后感觉到榛子轻拂在肩膀上，刺痛，然后将银色的桦树干紧贴在胸前，它的光滑，它的坚硬，它的重要节和脊——这很好，这一切都很好，非常满意。除了植物的这种凉爽和微妙进入人的血液之外，没有什么可以做，没有什么可以满足。他是多么幸运，在他等待的时候，有这种可爱、微妙、反应灵敏的植物在等待着他；他是多么满足，多么幸福！

As he dried himself a little with his handkerchief, he thought about Hermione and the blow. He could feel a pain on the side of his head. But after all, what did it matter? What did Hermione matter, what did people matter altogether? There was this perfect cool loneliness, so lovely and fresh and unexplored. Really, what a mistake he had made, thinking he wanted people, thinking he wanted a woman. He did not want a woman—not in the least. The leaves and the primroses and the trees, they were really lovely and cool and desirable, they really came into the blood and were added on to him. He was enrichened now immeasurably, and so glad.
当他用手帕擦干身体时，他想起了赫敏和那一击。他能感觉到头部一侧疼痛。但归根结底，这又有什么关系呢？赫敏重要什么，人们又重要什么呢？有一种完美的、凉爽的孤独，如此可爱、新鲜、未经探索。真的，他犯了一个多么大的错误，以为他想要人，以为他想要女人。他不想要女人——一点也不想要。树叶、报春花和树木，它们真的很可爱、很凉爽、很令人向往，它们真的融入了他的血液，融入了他的身体里。他现在变得无比充实，而且非常高兴。

It was quite right of Hermione to want to kill him. What had he to do with her? Why should he pretend to have anything to do with human beings at all? Here was his world, he wanted nobody and nothing but the lovely, subtle, responsive vegetation, and himself, his own living self.
赫敏想要杀掉他是完全正确的。他和她有什么关系？他为什么要假装与人类有任何关系呢？这里就是他的世界，除了可爱、微妙、反应灵敏的植被和他自己，他自己的活生生的自我之外，他什么都不想要。

It was necessary to go back into the world. That was true. But that did not matter, so one knew where one belonged. He knew now where he belonged. This was his place, his marriage place. The world was extraneous.
有必要回到这个世界。确实如此。但这并不重要，所以人们知道自己属于哪里。他现在知道自己属于哪里了。这是他的地方，他的婚姻之地。世界是陌生的。

He climbed out of the valley, wondering if he were mad. But if so, he preferred his own madness, to the regular sanity. He rejoiced in his own madness, he was free. He did not want that old sanity of the world, which was become so repulsive. He rejoiced in the new-found world of his madness. It was so fresh and delicate and so satisfying.
他爬出山谷，怀疑自己是不是疯了。但如果是这样的话，他更喜欢自己的疯狂，而不是正常的理智。他为自己的疯狂而庆幸，他自由了。他不想要这个世界那种古老的理智，因为它变得如此令人厌恶。他为自己新发现的疯狂世界感到高兴。它是那么新鲜、细腻、那么令人满意。

As for the certain grief he felt at the same time, in his soul, that was only the remains of an old ethic, that bade a human being adhere to humanity. But he was weary of the old ethic, of the human being, and of humanity. He loved now the soft, delicate vegetation, that was so cool and perfect. He would overlook the old grief, he would put away the old ethic, he would be free in his new state.
至于他同时感受到的某种悲伤，在他的灵魂中，那只是一种古老的道德的残余，它要求人类遵守人性。但他厌倦了旧的伦理、人类和人性。他现在喜欢上了柔软细腻的植被，那是那么的凉爽和完美。他会忽视旧有的悲伤，他会抛弃旧有的道德，他会在新的状态下获得自由。

He was aware of the pain in his head becoming more and more difficult every minute. He was walking now along the road to the nearest station. It was raining and he had no hat. But then plenty of cranks went out nowadays without hats, in the rain.
他意识到自己的头部疼痛每一分钟都变得越来越剧烈。他现在正沿着路走向最近的车站。下雨了，他没戴帽子。但现在很多怪人在雨中出门时都不戴帽子。

He wondered again how much of his heaviness of heart, a certain depression, was due to fear, fear lest anybody should have seen him naked lying against the vegetation. What a dread he had of mankind, of other people! It amounted almost to horror, to a sort of dream terror—his horror of being observed by some other people. If he were on an island, like Alexander Selkirk, with only the creatures and the trees, he would be free and glad, there would be none of this heaviness, this misgiving. He could love the vegetation and be quite happy and unquestioned, by himself.
他再次想知道他的心情沉重，某种沮丧，有多少是由于恐惧，害怕有人看到他赤裸地躺在植被上。他对人类、对其他人有多么恐惧啊！这几乎等于恐惧，一种梦中的恐惧——他害怕被其他人看到。如果他像亚历山大·塞尔扣克一样在一个岛上，只有生物和树木，他会感到自由和快乐，不会有这种沉重，这种疑虑。他可以热爱这些植被，并且独自一人就可以感到非常快乐和毫无疑问。

He had better send a note to Hermione: she might trouble about him, and he did not want the onus of this. So at the station, he wrote saying:
他最好给赫敏写张便条：她可能会为他烦恼，而他不想承担这个责任。于是在车站，他写道：

I will go on to town—I don’t want to come back to Breadalby for the present. But it is quite all right—I don’t want you to mind having biffed me, in the least. Tell the others it is just one of my moods. You were quite right, to biff me—because I know you wanted to. So there’s the end of it.
我会继续进城——我暂时不想回布莱多尔比。不过没关系——至少我不希望你介意惹恼了我。告诉其他人这只是我的一种心情。你对我的攻击是对的——因为我知道你想这么做。所以事情就这样结束了。

In the train, however, he felt ill. Every motion was insufferable pain, and he was sick. He dragged himself from the station into a cab, feeling his way step by step, like a blind man, and held up only by a dim will.
然而，在火车上，他感到不舒服。每一个动作都带来难以忍受的疼痛，他感到恶心。他拖着自己的身子从车站走进一辆出租车，像一个盲人一样一步一步摸索着，只有微弱的意志支撑着他。

For a week or two he was ill, but he did not let Hermione know, and she thought he was sulking; there was a complete estrangement between them. She became rapt, abstracted in her conviction of exclusive righteousness. She lived in and by her own self-esteem, conviction of her own rightness of spirit.
他病了一两个星期，但他没有让赫敏知道，她以为他在生闷气。他们之间完全隔阂了。她全神贯注，全神贯注于她对绝对正义的信念。她靠自己的自尊和对自己精神正确性的信念而生活。

CHAPTER IX
第九章

COAL-DUST
煤炭粉末

Going home from school in the afternoon, the Brangwen girls descended the hill between the picturesque cottages of Willey Green till they came to the railway crossing. There they found the gate shut, because the colliery train was rumbling nearer. They could hear the small locomotive panting hoarsely as it advanced with caution between the embankments. The one-legged man in the little signal-hut by the road stared out from his security, like a crab from a snail-shell.
下午放学回家后，布兰文女孩下了威利格林风景如画的小屋之间的山坡，直到来到铁路道口。在那里，他们发现大门关着，因为煤矿列车正在隆隆地驶近。他们能听见小机车在堤岸间小心翼翼地前进时发出嘶哑的喘息声。路边信号小屋里的独腿男子从保安处向外张望，就像一只从蜗牛壳里爬出来的螃蟹。

Whilst the two girls waited, Gerald Crich trotted up on a red Arab mare. He rode well and softly, pleased with the delicate quivering of the creature between his knees. And he was very picturesque, at least in Gudrun’s eyes, sitting soft and close on the slender red mare, whose long tail flowed on the air. He saluted the two girls, and drew up at the crossing to wait for the gate, looking down the railway for the approaching train. In spite of her ironic smile at his picturesqueness, Gudrun liked to look at him. He was well-set and easy, his face with its warm tan showed up his whitish, coarse moustache, and his blue eyes were full of sharp light as he watched the distance.
当两个女孩等待时，杰拉尔德·克里奇骑着一匹红色的阿拉伯母马小跑过来。他骑得又好又轻，对膝盖间这个生物的微妙颤动感到满意。他非常美丽，至少在古德伦看来，他温柔地坐在那匹修长的红色母马身上，长长的尾巴在空中飘扬。他向两个女孩行了个礼，然后在路口停下来等待登机口，同时俯视着铁路，寻找驶近的火车。尽管古德伦对他的美貌露出讽刺的微笑，但她还是喜欢看着他。他神情安定，从容不迫，温暖的棕褐色脸庞上露出了他那白白的、粗糙的小胡子，蓝色的眼睛注视着远方，闪烁着锐利的光芒。

The locomotive chuffed slowly between the banks, hidden. The mare did not like it. She began to wince away, as if hurt by the unknown noise. But Gerald pulled her back and held her head to the gate. The sharp blasts of the chuffing engine broke with more and more force on her. The repeated sharp blows of unknown, terrifying noise struck through her till she was rocking with terror. She recoiled like a spring let go. But a glistening, half-smiling look came into Gerald’s face. He brought her back again, inevitably.
机车在河岸之间缓慢地行驶，隐藏着。母马不喜欢它。她开始皱起眉头，仿佛被未知的噪音伤害了。但杰拉尔德把她拉了回来，把她的头靠在了大门上。引擎发出的尖锐的轰鸣声对她造成越来越大的压力。未知的、恐怖的声音不断地猛烈地冲击着她，让她吓得浑身发抖。她像松开的弹簧一样向后退缩。但杰拉尔德的脸上露出了闪闪发光的半微笑的表情。他又把她带了回来，这是不可避免的。

The noise was released, the little locomotive with her clanking steel connecting-rod emerged on the highroad, clanking sharply. The mare rebounded like a drop of water from hot iron. Ursula and Gudrun pressed back into the hedge, in fear. But Gerald was heavy on the mare, and forced her back. It seemed as if he sank into her magnetically, and could thrust her back against herself.
声音散了，小机车的钢连杆叮当作响，出现在大路上，发出尖锐的叮当声。母马像热铁上的水滴一样反弹。乌苏拉和古德伦惊恐地退回树篱。但杰拉德对母马的压力很大，迫使她后退。仿佛他有磁性地陷入她的体内，可以将她推回到自己身上。

‘The fool!’ cried Ursula loudly. ‘Why doesn’t he ride away till it’s gone by?’
“这个傻瓜！”乌苏拉大声喊道。 “为什么他不骑车走，直到它过去？”

Gudrun was looking at him with black-dilated, spellbound eyes. But he sat glistening and obstinate, forcing the wheeling mare, which spun and swerved like a wind, and yet could not get out of the grasp of his will, nor escape from the mad clamour of terror that resounded through her, as the trucks thumped slowly, heavily, horrifying, one after the other, one pursuing the other, over the rails of the crossing.
古德伦用黑色的放大的、着迷的眼睛看着他。但他却坐在那里，闪闪发光，顽固不化，迫使那匹旋转的母马像风一样旋转、转向，却无法摆脱他意志的控制，也无法摆脱卡车轰鸣时在她身上回响的恐怖的疯狂喧嚣。缓慢地、沉重地、令人恐惧地，一个接一个，一个追一个，越过十字路口的栏杆。

The locomotive, as if wanting to see what could be done, put on the brakes, and back came the trucks rebounding on the iron buffers, striking like horrible cymbals, clashing nearer and nearer in frightful strident concussions. The mare opened her mouth and rose slowly, as if lifted up on a wind of terror. Then suddenly her fore feet struck out, as she convulsed herself utterly away from the horror. Back she went, and the two girls clung to each other, feeling she must fall backwards on top of him. But he leaned forward, his face shining with fixed amusement, and at last he brought her down, sank her down, and was bearing her back to the mark. But as strong as the pressure of his compulsion was the repulsion of her utter terror, throwing her back away from the railway, so that she spun round and round, on two legs, as if she were in the centre of some whirlwind. It made Gudrun faint with poignant dizziness, which seemed to penetrate to her heart.
机车似乎想看看能做什么，踩下了刹车，卡车在铁制缓冲器上反弹回来，像可怕的铙钹一样撞击，在可怕的刺耳的震荡中碰撞得越来越近。母马张开嘴，缓缓起身，仿佛被一阵恐怖的风吹起。然后突然她的前脚猛地一出，她全身抽搐，完全摆脱了恐惧。她向后退去，两个女孩紧紧地抱在一起，觉得她一定会向后倒在他身上。但他向前倾身，脸上闪烁着固定的乐趣，最后他把她放倒，让她沉下去，把她带回目标。但与他的强迫压力一样强大的是她彻底的恐惧的排斥，将她从铁路上扔了出去，这样她就用两条腿转了一圈又一圈，仿佛她处于某种旋风的中心。这让古德伦因剧烈的眩晕而昏倒，似乎刺入了她的心。

‘No—! No—! Let her go! Let her go, you fool, you FOOL—!’ cried Ursula at the top of her voice, completely outside herself. And Gudrun hated her bitterly for being outside herself. It was unendurable that Ursula’s voice was so powerful and naked.
'不-！不-！让她走！让她走吧，你这个傻瓜，你这个傻瓜——！”乌苏拉用最大的声音喊道，完全失去了自我。古德伦非常恨她的游离。乌苏拉的声音如此有力，如此赤裸裸，令人难以忍受。

A sharpened look came on Gerald’s face. He bit himself down on the mare like a keen edge biting home, and FORCED her round. She roared as she breathed, her nostrils were two wide, hot holes, her mouth was apart, her eyes frenzied. It was a repulsive sight. But he held on her unrelaxed, with an almost mechanical relentlessness, keen as a sword pressing in to her. Both man and horse were sweating with violence. Yet he seemed calm as a ray of cold sunshine.
杰拉尔德的脸上露出了尖锐的表情。他像利刃一样咬住母马，迫使她转过身来。她呼吸时发出咆哮，鼻孔变成两个宽大的滚烫的洞，嘴巴张开，眼神疯狂。这是一个令人厌恶的景象。但他毫不放松地抱住了她，几乎是机械般的冷酷无情，锐利得像一把剑压向她。人和马都猛得满头大汗。但他却显得平静如一缕冰冷的阳光。

Meanwhile the eternal trucks were rumbling on, very slowly, treading one after the other, one after the other, like a disgusting dream that has no end. The connecting chains were grinding and squeaking as the tension varied, the mare pawed and struck away mechanically now, her terror fulfilled in her, for now the man encompassed her; her paws were blind and pathetic as she beat the air, the man closed round her, and brought her down, almost as if she were part of his own physique.
与此同时，永恒的卡车隆隆作响，非常缓慢，一辆接一辆，一辆接一辆，就像一场令人厌恶的没有尽头的梦。随着张力的变化，连接的铁链发出摩擦声和吱吱声，母马机械地用爪子抓着并击开，她的恐惧在她身上实现了，因为现在男人包围了她；当她拍打空气时，她的爪子盲目而可怜，男人将她围住，将她放倒，几乎就像她是他自己身体的一部分一样。

‘And she’s bleeding! She’s bleeding!’ cried Ursula, frantic with opposition and hatred of Gerald. She alone understood him perfectly, in pure opposition.
‘她在流血！她在流血！”乌苏拉喊道，她因对杰拉尔德的反对和仇恨而疯狂。只有她完全理解他，但完全反对他。

Gudrun looked and saw the trickles of blood on the sides of the mare, and she turned white. And then on the very wound the bright spurs came down, pressing relentlessly. The world reeled and passed into nothingness for Gudrun, she could not know any more.
古德伦一看，看到母马的身体两侧有血迹，她的脸色变得苍白。然后，明亮的马刺就落到了伤口上，无情地压着。对于古珍来说，世界摇摇欲坠，化为虚无，她无法再知道了。

When she recovered, her soul was calm and cold, without feeling. The trucks were still rumbling by, and the man and the mare were still fighting. But she herself was cold and separate, she had no more feeling for them. She was quite hard and cold and indifferent.
当她回过神来的时候，她的灵魂平静而冰冷，没有任何感觉。卡车仍在隆隆驶过，人与母马仍在打斗。但她自己却冷漠而孤立，对他们不再有任何感觉。她性格非常冷酷、冷漠、冷漠。

They could see the top of the hooded guard’s-van approaching, the sound of the trucks was diminishing, there was hope of relief from the intolerable noise. The heavy panting of the half-stunned mare sounded automatically, the man seemed to be relaxing confidently, his will bright and unstained. The guard’s-van came up, and passed slowly, the guard staring out in his transition on the spectacle in the road. And, through the man in the closed wagon, Gudrun could see the whole scene spectacularly, isolated and momentary, like a vision isolated in eternity.
他们可以看到带兜帽的警卫车的车顶正在靠近，卡车的声音正在减弱，有希望从难以忍受的噪音中解脱出来。半昏迷状态的母马粗重的喘息声自动响起，男人似乎很自信地放松下来，意志明亮不染。警卫的货车开过来，慢慢地过去，警卫在变换过程中盯着路上的景象。而且，透过封闭的马车里的人，古德伦可以看到整个场景，壮观，孤立和短暂，就像永恒中孤立的幻象。

Lovely, grateful silence seemed to trail behind the receding train. How sweet the silence is! Ursula looked with hatred on the buffers of the diminishing wagon. The gatekeeper stood ready at the door of his hut, to proceed to open the gate. But Gudrun sprang suddenly forward, in front of the struggling horse, threw off the latch and flung the gates asunder, throwing one-half to the keeper, and running with the other half, forwards. Gerald suddenly let go the horse and leaped forwards, almost on to Gudrun. She was not afraid. As he jerked aside the mare’s head, Gudrun cried, in a strange, high voice, like a gull, or like a witch screaming out from the side of the road:
渐渐远去的火车后面似乎弥漫着可爱、感激的沉默。沉默是多么甜蜜啊！乌苏拉仇恨地看着日益缩小的马车的缓冲垫。看门人站在小屋门口，准备去开门。但古德伦突然向前一跃，冲到了挣扎的马匹面前，甩开门闩，把大门撞开，把一半扔给守门人，然后带着另一半向前跑。杰拉尔德突然放开马匹，向前一跃，几乎扑到了古德伦身上。她并不害怕。当他把母马的头猛地推开时，古德伦用一种奇怪的、高亢的声音喊道，声音像海鸥，又像女巫在路边尖叫：

‘I should think you’re proud.’
“我应该认为你很自豪。”

The words were distinct and formed. The man, twisting aside on his dancing horse, looked at her in some surprise, some wondering interest. Then the mare’s hoofs had danced three times on the drum-like sleepers of the crossing, and man and horse were bounding springily, unequally up the road.
这些词是清晰且成形的。那个男人在舞马上扭过身来，有些惊讶地看着她，有些好奇地感兴趣。然后，马蹄在路口鼓状的枕木上舞动了三下，人和马在路上跳跃着，不平等地前进。

The two girls watched them go. The gate-keeper hobbled thudding over the logs of the crossing, with his wooden leg. He had fastened the gate. Then he also turned, and called to the girls:
两个女孩目送他们离去。守门人用木腿一瘸一拐地踩着过道的木头。他已经把门锁上了。随后他也转过身来，对众姑娘们喊道：

‘A masterful young jockey, that; ‘ll have his own road, if ever anybody would.’
“一位出色的年轻骑师； “如果有人愿意的话，他会有自己的路。”

‘Yes,’ cried Ursula, in her hot, overbearing voice. ‘Why couldn’t he take the horse away, till the trucks had gone by? He’s a fool, and a bully. Does he think it’s manly, to torture a horse? It’s a living thing, why should he bully it and torture it?’
“是的，”乌苏拉用她火热、霸道的声音喊道。 “为什么他不能在卡车经过之前把马带走呢？”他是个傻瓜，也是个恶霸。他认为折磨一匹马是有男子气概的吗？一个活物，他为何要欺负它、折磨它？

There was a pause, then the gate-keeper shook his head, and replied:
顿了顿，守门人摇了摇头，回答道：

‘Yes, it’s as nice a little mare as you could set eyes on—beautiful little thing, beautiful. Now you couldn’t see his father treat any animal like that—not you. They’re as different as they welly can be, Gerald Crich and his father—two different men, different made.’
“是的，这是一匹你能看到的最漂亮的小母马——美丽的小东西，美丽的。现在你不能看到他的父亲那样对待任何动物——你不行。杰拉尔德·克里奇和他的父亲是多么不同的人——两个不同的人，不同的出身。

Then there was a pause.
然后停顿了一下。

‘But why does he do it?’ cried Ursula, ‘why does he? Does he think he’s grand, when he’s bullied a sensitive creature, ten times as sensitive as himself?’
“但是他为什么这么做？”乌苏拉喊道，“他为什么这么做？当他欺负一个比自己敏感十倍的敏感生物时，他还以为自己很伟大吗？

Again there was a cautious pause. Then again the man shook his head, as if he would say nothing, but would think the more.
又是一阵谨慎的停顿。男人又摇了摇头，似乎什么也不说，却又想得更多。

‘I expect he’s got to train the mare to stand to anything,’ he replied. ‘A pure-bred Harab—not the sort of breed as is used to round here—different sort from our sort altogether. They say as he got her from Constantinople.’
“我希望他必须训练这匹母马能够承受任何事情，”他回答道。 “一只纯种的哈拉布——不是这里常见的品种——与我们的品种完全不同。他们说是他从君士坦丁堡带她来的。

‘He would!’ said Ursula. ‘He’d better have left her to the Turks, I’m sure they would have had more decency towards her.’
“他会的！”乌苏拉说。 “他最好把她留给土耳其人，我相信他们会对她更有礼貌。”

The man went in to drink his can of tea, the girls went on down the lane, that was deep in soft black dust. Gudrun was as if numbed in her mind by the sense of indomitable soft weight of the man, bearing down into the living body of the horse: the strong, indomitable thighs of the blond man clenching the palpitating body of the mare into pure control; a sort of soft white magnetic domination from the loins and thighs and calves, enclosing and encompassing the mare heavily into unutterable subordination, soft blood-subordination, terrible.
男人进去喝了罐茶，女孩们继续沿着小巷走去，那条小巷深陷在柔软的黑色灰尘中。古德伦仿佛被这个男人不屈不挠的柔软重量压到了马的活生生的身体上而麻木了：金发男人强壮而不屈不挠的大腿紧紧地控制着母马的颤动的身体;一种来自腰部、大腿和小腿的柔软的白色磁力统治，将母马深深地包裹起来，陷入难以言喻的从属地位，柔软的血液从属地位，可怕。

On the left, as the girls walked silently, the coal-mine lifted its great mounds and its patterned head-stocks, the black railway with the trucks at rest looked like a harbour just below, a large bay of railroad with anchored wagons.
左边，女孩们默默地走着，煤矿抬起了它的大土丘和有图案的车头，停着卡车的黑色铁路看起来就像下面的一个港口，一个停泊着货车的大铁路海湾。

Near the second level-crossing, that went over many bright rails, was a farm belonging to the collieries, and a great round globe of iron, a disused boiler, huge and rusty and perfectly round, stood silently in a paddock by the road. The hens were pecking round it, some chickens were balanced on the drinking trough, wagtails flew away in among trucks, from the water.
靠近第二个平交道口，经过许多明亮的铁轨，是一个属于煤矿的农场，一个巨大的圆形铁球，一个废弃的锅炉，巨大而生锈，完美的圆形，静静地立在路边的围场里。母鸡在它周围啄食，一些鸡在饮水槽上保持平衡，鹡鸰从水中飞到卡车之间。

On the other side of the wide crossing, by the road-side, was a heap of pale-grey stones for mending the roads, and a cart standing, and a middle-aged man with whiskers round his face was leaning on his shovel, talking to a young man in gaiters, who stood by the horse’s head. Both men were facing the crossing.
宽阔的路口另一边，路边，堆着一堆灰白色的修路石块，一辆大车停在那里，一个满脸胡须的中年男子靠在铲子上，与站在马头旁的一个戴绑腿的年轻人交谈。两人都面向十字路口。

They saw the two girls appear, small, brilliant figures in the near distance, in the strong light of the late afternoon. Both wore light, gay summer dresses, Ursula had an orange-coloured knitted coat, Gudrun a pale yellow, Ursula wore canary yellow stockings, Gudrun bright rose, the figures of the two women seemed to glitter in progress over the wide bay of the railway crossing, white and orange and yellow and rose glittering in motion across a hot world silted with coal-dust.
他们看到两个女孩出现在近处，在午后的强烈阳光下，她们娇小而明亮的身影出现了。两人都穿着浅色、欢快的夏季连衣裙，乌苏拉穿橙色针织外套，古德伦穿淡黄色，乌苏拉穿金丝雀黄色长筒袜，古德伦穿鲜玫瑰色，两个女人的身影似乎在宽阔的铁路海湾上闪闪发光。白色、橙色、黄色和玫瑰色的交叉路口在充满煤尘的炎热世界中闪闪发光。

The two men stood quite still in the heat, watching. The elder was a short, hard-faced energetic man of middle age, the younger a labourer of twenty-three or so. They stood in silence watching the advance of the sisters. They watched whilst the girls drew near, and whilst they passed, and whilst they receded down the dusty road, that had dwellings on one side, and dusty young corn on the other.
两个人在炎热中一动不动地站着，看着。老大是个身材矮小、面容严肃、精力充沛的中年男子，老小则是二十三岁左右的工人。她们静静地站着，注视着姐妹们的行进。他们注视着女孩们走近、经过、沿着尘土飞扬的道路退去，道路的一侧是住宅，另一侧是布满灰尘的玉米粒。

Then the elder man, with the whiskers round his face, said in a prurient manner to the young man:
这时，满脸胡须的年长者用好色的语气对年轻人说道：

‘What price that, eh? She’ll do, won’t she?’
‘那要多少钱，嗯？她会做的，不是吗？

‘Which?’ asked the young man, eagerly, with laugh.
“哪个？”年轻人急切地笑着问道。

‘Her with the red stockings. What d’you say? I’d give my week’s wages for five minutes; what!—just for five minutes.’
‘穿着红丝袜的她。你说什么？我愿意花五分钟给出我一周的工资；什么！——就五分钟。”

Again the young man laughed.
年轻人又笑了。

‘Your missis ‘ud have summat to say to you,’ he replied.
“你的小姐有一句话要对你说，”他回答道。

Gudrun had turned round and looked at the two men. They were to her sinister creatures, standing watching after her, by the heap of pale grey slag. She loathed the man with whiskers round his face.
古德伦转过身来看着这两个人。对于她来说，它们是邪恶的生物，站在那堆浅灰色的矿渣旁注视着她。她讨厌这个满脸胡须的男人。

‘You’re first class, you are,’ the man said to her, and to the distance.
“你是一流的，是的，”男人对她说道，同时也对远处说道。

‘Do you think it would be worth a week’s wages?’ said the younger man, musing.
“你认为这值得一周的工资吗？”年轻人若有所思地说。

‘Do I? I’d put ‘em bloody-well down this second—‘
‘是吗？我会在这一秒把他们彻底放下——”

The younger man looked after Gudrun and Ursula objectively, as if he wished to calculate what there might be, that was worth his week’s wages. He shook his head with fatal misgiving.
年轻人客观地照顾着古德伦和乌苏拉，仿佛他想计算一下可能有什么值得他一周的工资。他摇摇头，带着致命的疑虑。

‘No,’ he said. ‘It’s not worth that to me.’
“不，”他说。 “这对我来说不值得。”

‘Isn’t?’ said the old man. ‘By God, if it isn’t to me!’
“不是吗？”老人说。 “上帝啊，如果不是我的话！”

And he went on shovelling his stones.
他继续铲石头。

The girls descended between the houses with slate roofs and blackish brick walls. The heavy gold glamour of approaching sunset lay over all the colliery district, and the ugliness overlaid with beauty was like a narcotic to the senses. On the roads silted with black dust, the rich light fell more warmly, more heavily, over all the amorphous squalor a kind of magic was cast, from the glowing close of day.
女孩们在石板屋顶和黑色砖墙的房屋之间走下来。夕阳西下，浓重的金色光芒笼罩了整个矿区，丑陋与美丽交织在一起，就像麻醉了感官。在布满黑色灰尘的道路上，丰富的光线更加温暖，更加沉重，在所有无定形的肮脏污秽上，一种魔法从白天的辉光中投射出来。

‘It has a foul kind of beauty, this place,’ said Gudrun, evidently suffering from fascination. ‘Can’t you feel in some way, a thick, hot attraction in it? I can. And it quite stupifies me.’
“这个地方有一种肮脏的美，”古德伦说道，显然是被迷住了。 ‘你难道不能以某种方式感受到其中有一种浓浓的、炙热的吸引力吗？我可以。这让我很困惑。

They were passing between blocks of miners’ dwellings. In the back yards of several dwellings, a miner could be seen washing himself in the open on this hot evening, naked down to the loins, his great trousers of moleskin slipping almost away. Miners already cleaned were sitting on their heels, with their backs near the walls, talking and silent in pure physical well-being, tired, and taking physical rest. Their voices sounded out with strong intonation, and the broad dialect was curiously caressing to the blood. It seemed to envelop Gudrun in a labourer’s caress, there was in the whole atmosphere a resonance of physical men, a glamorous thickness of labour and maleness, surcharged in the air. But it was universal in the district, and therefore unnoticed by the inhabitants.
他们正穿过矿工住宅区。在这个炎热的夜晚，在几处住宅的后院里，可以看到一名矿工在露天洗澡，他赤裸着下身，大长的鼹鼠皮裤几乎滑落。已经清理完毕的矿工们坐在后跟上，背靠着墙壁，在纯粹的身体健康中说话或沉默，疲惫不堪，正在休息。他们的声音声调铿锵有力，宽广的方言奇怪地抚摸着血液。古德伦似乎被劳动者的爱抚包围着，整个气氛中充满了肉体男人的共鸣，空气中弥漫着一种迷人的劳动和男性气概。但这种现象在该地区很普遍，因此没有被居民注意到。

To Gudrun, however, it was potent and half-repulsive. She could never tell why Beldover was so utterly different from London and the south, why one’s whole feelings were different, why one seemed to live in another sphere. Now she realised that this was the world of powerful, underworld men who spent most of their time in the darkness. In their voices she could hear the voluptuous resonance of darkness, the strong, dangerous underworld, mindless, inhuman. They sounded also like strange machines, heavy, oiled. The voluptuousness was like that of machinery, cold and iron.
然而，对古德伦来说，它是有效的，但又有些令人厌恶。她永远无法解释为什么贝尔多弗与伦敦和南方如此不同，为什么一个人的整体感受不同，为什么一个人似乎生活在另一个领域。现在她意识到，这是一个强大的黑道男人的世界，他们大部分时间都在黑暗中度过。在他们的声音中，她能听到黑暗的性感共鸣，强大而危险的地下世界，无意识的，非人的。它们听起来也像奇怪的机器，笨重，涂了油。肉欲如机械般，冰冷如铁。

It was the same every evening when she came home, she seemed to move through a wave of disruptive force, that was given off from the presence of thousands of vigorous, underworld, half-automatised colliers, and which went to the brain and the heart, awaking a fatal desire, and a fatal callousness.
每天晚上回到家的时候，她都一样，似乎经历了一股破坏性的力量，这种力量是从成千上万个充满活力的、黑社会的、半自动化的矿工身上散发出来的，直达大脑和心脏。 ，唤醒了致命的欲望，和致命的冷酷。

There came over her a nostalgia for the place. She hated it, she knew how utterly cut off it was, how hideous and how sickeningly mindless. Sometimes she beat her wings like a new Daphne, turning not into a tree but a machine. And yet, she was overcome by the nostalgia. She struggled to get more and more into accord with the atmosphere of the place, she craved to get her satisfaction of it.
她对这个地方产生了一种怀念之情。她讨厌它，她知道它是多么彻底地与世隔绝，多么可怕，多么令人作呕的愚蠢。有时她像新的达芙妮一样拍打翅膀，不再变成一棵树，而是变成一台机器。然而，她还是被怀旧之情所征服。她努力越来越适应这个地方的氛围，她渴望得到自己的满足。

She felt herself drawn out at evening into the main street of the town, that was uncreated and ugly, and yet surcharged with this same potent atmosphere of intense, dark callousness. There were always miners about. They moved with their strange, distorted dignity, a certain beauty, and unnatural stillness in their bearing, a look of abstraction and half resignation in their pale, often gaunt faces. They belonged to another world, they had a strange glamour, their voices were full of an intolerable deep resonance, like a machine’s burring, a music more maddening than the siren’s long ago.
傍晚时分，她感觉自己被吸引到镇上的主要街道上，那条街道既原始又丑陋，却又充满了同样强烈、黑暗、冷酷的强烈气氛。周围总是有矿工。他们的举止带着奇怪的、扭曲的尊严、某种美感和不自然的静止，苍白、常常憔悴的脸上带着一种心不在焉和半听天由命的神情。他们属于另一个世界，他们有一种奇异的魅力，他们的声音充满了令人难以忍受的低沉共鸣，就像机器的嗡嗡声，比很久以前的海妖的音乐更令人疯狂。

She found herself, with the rest of the common women, drawn out on Friday evenings to the little market. Friday was pay-day for the colliers, and Friday night was market night. Every woman was abroad, every man was out, shopping with his wife, or gathering with his pals. The pavements were dark for miles around with people coming in, the little market-place on the crown of the hill, and the main street of Beldover were black with thickly-crowded men and women.
她发现自己和其他普通妇女一样，每周五晚上都会去小市场。周五是煤矿工人的发薪日，周五晚上是集市之夜。每个女人都在国外，每个男人都在外面，和妻子一起购物，或者和朋友聚会。方圆数英里的人行道都漆黑一片，人们纷纷涌入，山顶上的小市场和贝尔多弗的主要街道漆黑一片，挤满了男人和女人。

It was dark, the market-place was hot with kerosene flares, which threw a ruddy light on the grave faces of the purchasing wives, and on the pale abstract faces of the men. The air was full of the sound of criers and of people talking, thick streams of people moved on the pavements towards the solid crowd of the market. The shops were blazing and packed with women, in the streets were men, mostly men, miners of all ages. Money was spent with almost lavish freedom.
天很黑，市场上燃着煤油，火光滚滚，在买房的妻子严肃的脸上和男人苍白抽象的脸上投射出红润的光芒。空气中充满了叫喊声和人们的交谈声，人行道上川流不息的人潮涌向市场里拥挤的人群。商店里灯火通明，挤满了女人，街上则是男人，大部分是男人，是各个年龄段的矿工。钱花得几乎是奢侈的自由。

The carts that came could not pass through. They had to wait, the driver calling and shouting, till the dense crowd would make way. Everywhere, young fellows from the outlying districts were making conversation with the girls, standing in the road and at the corners. The doors of the public-houses were open and full of light, men passed in and out in a continual stream, everywhere men were calling out to one another, or crossing to meet one another, or standing in little gangs and circles, discussing, endlessly discussing. The sense of talk, buzzing, jarring, half-secret, the endless mining and political wrangling, vibrated in the air like discordant machinery. And it was their voices which affected Gudrun almost to swooning. They aroused a strange, nostalgic ache of desire, something almost demoniacal, never to be fulfilled.
来的车无法通过。他们不得不等待，司机大声叫喊，直到密集的人群让路。到处都是来自边远地区的小伙子，站在路边、拐角处与女孩们交谈。酒馆的门敞开着，灯火通明，人们川流不息地进进出出，到处都是人们互相呼喊，或者交叉相见，或者三五成群地站着，讨论着，无休止地讨论。谈话的感觉，嗡嗡声，刺耳的，半秘密的，无休止的采矿和政治争论，像不和谐的机器一样在空气中振动。正是他们的声音让古德伦几乎昏厥过去。它们激起了一种奇怪的、怀旧的欲望之痛，一种近乎恶魔般的、永远无法实现的东西。

Like any other common girl of the district, Gudrun strolled up and down, up and down the length of the brilliant two-hundred paces of the pavement nearest the market-place. She knew it was a vulgar thing to do; her father and mother could not bear it; but the nostalgia came over her, she must be among the people. Sometimes she sat among the louts in the cinema: rakish-looking, unattractive louts they were. Yet she must be among them.
像这个地区的其他普通女孩一样，古德伦在离市场最近的两百步光亮的人行道上走来走去。她知道这是一件粗俗的事情；她的父母无法忍受。但怀旧之情笼罩着她，她一定是在人民之中。有时候，她坐在电影院里的一群粗人中间：他们都是外表放荡、毫无吸引力的粗人。但她一定也在其中。

And, like any other common lass, she found her ‘boy.’ It was an electrician, one of the electricians introduced according to Gerald’s new scheme. He was an earnest, clever man, a scientist with a passion for sociology. He lived alone in a cottage, in lodgings, in Willey Green. He was a gentleman, and sufficiently well-to-do. His landlady spread the reports about him; he WOULD have a large wooden tub in his bedroom, and every time he came in from work, he WOULD have pails and pails of water brought up, to bathe in, then he put on clean shirt and under-clothing EVERY day, and clean silk socks; fastidious and exacting he was in these respects, but in every other way, most ordinary and unassuming.
而且，像其他普通姑娘一样，她找到了她的“男孩”。那是一名电工，是根据杰拉尔德的新计划引入的电工之一。他是一位认真、聪明的人，一位对社会学充满热情的科学家。他独自住在威利格林的一间小屋和寄宿处。他是一位绅士，而且非常富裕。他的女房东散布了有关他的消息；他的卧室里有一个大木桶，每次他下班回来，他都会提上一桶又一桶的水来洗澡，然后每天穿上干净的衬衫和内衣，并清洁丝袜；他在这些方面是挑剔和严格的，但在其他方面，他却是最普通和谦逊的。

Gudrun knew all these things. The Brangwen’s house was one to which the gossip came naturally and inevitably. Palmer was in the first place a friend of Ursula’s. But in his pale, elegant, serious face there showed the same nostalgia that Gudrun felt. He too must walk up and down the street on Friday evening. So he walked with Gudrun, and a friendship was struck up between them. But he was not in love with Gudrun; he REALLY wanted Ursula, but for some strange reason, nothing could happen between her and him. He liked to have Gudrun about, as a fellow-mind—but that was all. And she had no real feeling for him. He was a scientist, he had to have a woman to back him. But he was really impersonal, he had the fineness of an elegant piece of machinery. He was too cold, too destructive to care really for women, too great an egoist. He was polarised by the men. Individually he detested and despised them. In the mass they fascinated him, as machinery fascinated him. They were a new sort of machinery to him—but incalculable, incalculable.
古德伦知道所有这些事情。布兰文家是八卦自然而然、不可避免的地方。帕尔默首先是乌苏拉的朋友。但在他苍白、优雅、严肃的脸上，却流露出与古德伦同样的怀旧之情。周五晚上他也必须在街上走来走去。于是他与古德伦同行，他们之间建立了友谊。但他并不爱古珍；他爱的是古德伦。他真的想要乌苏拉，但出于某种奇怪的原因，他和她之间什么也没有发生。他喜欢有古德伦在身边，作为一个志同道合的人——但仅此而已。而她对他并没有真正的感觉。他是一名科学家，他必须有一个女人支持他。但他确实没有个性，他有一种优雅机械的精致。他太冷酷，太具有破坏性，无法真正关心女人，是一个太自私的人。他对男人的态度两极分化。他个人厌恶并鄙视他们。大众让他着迷，就像机器让他着迷一样。对他来说，它们是一种新型机器——但无法估量，无法估量。

So Gudrun strolled the streets with Palmer, or went to the cinema with him. And his long, pale, rather elegant face flickered as he made his sarcastic remarks. There they were, the two of them: two elegants in one sense: in the other sense, two units, absolutely adhering to the people, teeming with the distorted colliers. The same secret seemed to be working in the souls of all alike, Gudrun, Palmer, the rakish young bloods, the gaunt, middle-aged men. All had a secret sense of power, and of inexpressible destructiveness, and of fatal half-heartedness, a sort of rottenness in the will.
于是古德伦就和帕尔默一起逛街，或者和他一起去看电影。而他苍白而颇为优雅的长脸闪烁着讽刺的话语。他们就在那里，他们两个：在一种意义上是两个优雅的人；在另一种意义上，是两个单位，绝对地依附于人民，充满了扭曲的矿工。同样的秘密似乎在所有人的灵魂中起作用，古德伦、帕尔默、放荡的年轻人、憔悴的中年男子。所有人都有一种隐秘的力量感，一种难以言表的破坏性，一种致命的三心二意，一种意志的腐烂。

Sometimes Gudrun would start aside, see it all, see how she was sinking in. And then she was filled with a fury of contempt and anger. She felt she was sinking into one mass with the rest—all so close and intermingled and breathless. It was horrible. She stifled. She prepared for flight, feverishly she flew to her work. But soon she let go. She started off into the country—the darkish, glamorous country. The spell was beginning to work again.
有时古德伦会站在一边，看看这一切，看看她是如何融入其中的。然后她充满了蔑视和愤怒。她觉得自己正在和其他人融为一体——一切都那么紧密、混杂在一起，令人喘不过气来。那太差了。她窒息了。她准备起飞，狂热地飞去上班。但很快她就​​放手了。她开始进入乡村——一个黑暗而迷人的乡村。咒语又开始起作用了。

SKETCH-BOOK
素描本

One morning the sisters were sketching by the side of Willey Water, at the remote end of the lake. Gudrun had waded out to a gravelly shoal, and was seated like a Buddhist, staring fixedly at the water-plants that rose succulent from the mud of the low shores. What she could see was mud, soft, oozy, watery mud, and from its festering chill, water-plants rose up, thick and cool and fleshy, very straight and turgid, thrusting out their leaves at right angles, and having dark lurid colours, dark green and blotches of black-purple and bronze. But she could feel their turgid fleshy structure as in a sensuous vision, she KNEW how they rose out of the mud, she KNEW how they thrust out from themselves, how they stood stiff and succulent against the air.
一天早上，姐妹俩正在湖的尽头威利湖边画画。古珍趟过一片砾石浅滩，像佛教徒一样坐着，目不转睛地盯着从低岸泥泞中长出的水生植物。她看到的是泥土，软软的，软软的，湿漉漉的，水汪汪的泥土，水生植物从溃烂的寒气中升起，厚实、凉爽、肉质，笔直而肿胀，叶子呈直角伸出，颜色深沉、艳丽。 、深绿色以及黑紫色和青铜色斑点。但她能感觉到它们肿胀的肉质结构，就像在感官视觉中一样，她知道它们如何从泥浆中升起，她知道它们如何从自身中伸出，它们如何在空气中僵硬而多汁地站立。

Ursula was watching the butterflies, of which there were dozens near the water, little blue ones suddenly snapping out of nothingness into a jewel-life, a large black-and-red one standing upon a flower and breathing with his soft wings, intoxicatingly, breathing pure, ethereal sunshine; two white ones wrestling in the low air; there was a halo round them; ah, when they came tumbling nearer they were orangetips, and it was the orange that had made the halo. Ursula rose and drifted away, unconscious like the butterflies.
乌苏拉正在观察蝴蝶，水边有几十只蝴蝶，蓝色的小蝴蝶突然从虚无中突然变成了宝石般的生命，一只黑红色的大蝴蝶站在一朵花上，用柔软的翅膀呼吸，令人陶醉，呼吸纯净、空灵的阳光；两只白色的在低空中摔跤；他们周围有光环；啊，当它们翻滚靠近时，它们是橙色的尖端，正是橙色形成了光环。乌苏拉站起身，飘然而去，像蝴蝶一样失去知觉。

Gudrun, absorbed in a stupor of apprehension of surging water-plants, sat crouched on the shoal, drawing, not looking up for a long time, and then staring unconsciously, absorbedly at the rigid, naked, succulent stems. Her feet were bare, her hat lay on the bank opposite.
古德伦全神贯注于汹涌的水草，他蹲在浅滩上画着画，很长一段时间没有抬头，然后无意识地全神贯注地盯着那些僵硬、裸露、多汁的茎。她光着脚，帽子放在对面的河岸上。

She started out of her trance, hearing the knocking of oars. She looked round. There was a boat with a gaudy Japanese parasol, and a man in white, rowing. The woman was Hermione, and the man was Gerald. She knew it instantly. And instantly she perished in the keen FRISSON of anticipation, an electric vibration in her veins, intense, much more intense than that which was always humming low in the atmosphere of Beldover.
她从恍惚中醒来，听到桨的敲击声。她环顾四周。一艘小船撑着华丽的日本阳伞，还有一个白衣男子在划船。那个女人是赫敏，那个男人是杰拉德。她立刻就知道了。立刻，她就在期待的剧烈颤抖中死去了，她的血管里充满了电击般的震动，强烈，比贝尔多弗的气氛中总是低沉的嗡嗡声强烈得多。

Gerald was her escape from the heavy slough of the pale, underworld, automatic colliers. He started out of the mud. He was master. She saw his back, the movement of his white loins. But not that—it was the whiteness he seemed to enclose as he bent forwards, rowing. He seemed to stoop to something. His glistening, whitish hair seemed like the electricity of the sky.
杰拉尔德是她逃离苍白、地下世界、自动煤矿的沉重泥沼的避难所。他从泥泞中起步。他是主人。她看到了他的背影，看到了他洁白的腰部的活动。但不是那个——而是他向前弯腰划船时似乎包围着的白色。他似乎弯腰去做某事。他那闪闪发亮的白发就像是天空的电流。

‘There’s Gudrun,’ came Hermione’s voice floating distinct over the water. ‘We will go and speak to her. Do you mind?’
“古德伦在那儿，”赫敏的声音清晰地飘过水面。 ‘我们会去和她谈谈。你介意吗？'

Gerald looked round and saw the girl standing by the water’s edge, looking at him. He pulled the boat towards her, magnetically, without thinking of her. In his world, his conscious world, she was still nobody. He knew that Hermione had a curious pleasure in treading down all the social differences, at least apparently, and he left it to her.
杰拉尔德环顾四周，看到女孩站在水边看着他。他用磁力将船拉向她，没有想到她。在他的世界里，在他的意识世界里，她仍然是一个无名小卒。他知道赫敏在消除所有社会差异方面有一种奇怪的乐趣，至少表面上是这样，他把这件事留给了她。

‘How do you do, Gudrun?’ sang Hermione, using the Christian name in the fashionable manner. ‘What are you doing?’
“你好吗，古德伦？”赫敏用时髦的方式用教名唱道。 '你在干什么？'

‘How do you do, Hermione? I WAS sketching.’
‘你好吗，赫敏？我正在画素描。

‘Were you?’ The boat drifted nearer, till the keel ground on the bank. ‘May we see? I should like to SO much.’
“你是吗？”船漂得越来越近，直到龙骨落在岸边。 ‘我们可以看看吗？我非常想这么做。

It was no use resisting Hermione’s deliberate intention.
抗拒赫敏的故意是没有用的。

‘Well—‘ said Gudrun reluctantly, for she always hated to have her unfinished work exposed—‘there’s nothing in the least interesting.’
“嗯——”古德伦不情愿地说，因为她总是讨厌把自己未完成的作品暴露出来——“一点也不有趣。”

‘Isn’t there? But let me see, will you?’
‘不是有吗？但让我看看，好吗？

Gudrun reached out the sketch-book, Gerald stretched from the boat to take it. And as he did so, he remembered Gudrun’s last words to him, and her face lifted up to him as he sat on the swerving horse. An intensification of pride went over his nerves, because he felt, in some way she was compelled by him. The exchange of feeling between them was strong and apart from their consciousness.
古德伦伸出了素描本，杰拉尔德从船上伸出手来接过它。当他这么做的时候，他想起了古德伦对他说的最后一句话，当他坐在那匹急转弯的马上时，她的脸抬起来看着他。一种强烈的自豪感笼罩着他的神经，因为他觉得，在某种程度上，她被他强迫了。他们之间的感情交流是强烈的，而且是脱离意识的。

And as if in a spell, Gudrun was aware of his body, stretching and surging like the marsh-fire, stretching towards her, his hand coming straight forward like a stem. Her voluptuous, acute apprehension of him made the blood faint in her veins, her mind went dim and unconscious. And he rocked on the water perfectly, like the rocking of phosphorescence. He looked round at the boat. It was drifting off a little. He lifted the oar to bring it back. And the exquisite pleasure of slowly arresting the boat, in the heavy-soft water, was complete as a swoon.
仿佛在咒语中，古德伦意识到自己的身体像沼泽之火一样伸展和涌动，向她伸展，他的手像一根茎一样笔直地向前伸出。她对他的强烈的、强烈的恐惧让她血管里的血液变得微弱，她的头脑变得昏暗和无意识。他在水面上完美地摇摆，就像磷光的摇摆一样。他环顾船身。它有点偏离了。他举起桨，想把它带回来。在又厚又软的水中慢慢停住小船的那种美妙的快感简直让人神魂颠倒。

‘THAT’S what you have done,’ said Hermione, looking searchingly at the plants on the shore, and comparing with Gudrun’s drawing. Gudrun looked round in the direction of Hermione’s long, pointing finger. ‘That is it, isn’t it?’ repeated Hermione, needing confirmation.
“这就是你所做的，”赫敏说，一边仔细地看着岸上的植物，一边与古德伦的画作比较。古德伦朝赫敏长长的手指方向望去。 “就是这样，不是吗？”赫敏重复道，需要确认。

‘Yes,’ said Gudrun automatically, taking no real heed.
“是的，”古德伦自然地说，没有真正在意。

‘Let me look,’ said Gerald, reaching forward for the book. But Hermione ignored him, he must not presume, before she had finished. But he, his will as unthwarted and as unflinching as hers, stretched forward till he touched the book. A little shock, a storm of revulsion against him, shook Hermione unconsciously. She released the book when he had not properly got it, and it tumbled against the side of the boat and bounced into the water.
“让我看看，”杰拉德说着，伸手去拿那本书。但在她说完之前，赫敏就忽略了他，他绝不能这么认为。但他的意志和她一样毫不犹豫、毫不畏缩，向前伸展，直到触到了书本。一阵小小的震惊，一股对他的厌恶风暴，赫敏不自觉地震动了。当他还没拿到书时，她松开了书，书在船边翻滚，弹进了水里。

‘There!’ sang Hermione, with a strange ring of malevolent victory. ‘I’m so sorry, so awfully sorry. Can’t you get it, Gerald?’
“那儿！”赫敏唱道，带着一种奇怪的恶毒胜利的声音。 ‘我非常抱歉，非常抱歉。你听不懂吗，杰拉德？

This last was said in a note of anxious sneering that made Gerald’s veins tingle with fine hate for her. He leaned far out of the boat, reaching down into the water. He could feel his position was ridiculous, his loins exposed behind him.
最后这句话是带着焦急的冷笑说的，这让杰拉尔德的血管因为对她的仇恨而刺痛。他把身体探出船外，把手伸进水里。他感觉自己的姿势很可笑，腰部暴露在身后。

‘It is of no importance,’ came the strong, clanging voice of Gudrun. She seemed to touch him. But he reached further, the boat swayed violently. Hermione, however, remained unperturbed. He grasped the book, under the water, and brought it up, dripping.
“这并不重要，”古德伦用铿锵有力的声音说道。她似乎触碰了他。但他伸手再远，船却剧烈晃动。然而赫敏依然泰然自若。他抓起水下的书，把它提了上来，水还在滴着。

‘I’m so dreadfully sorry—dreadfully sorry,’ repeated Hermione. ‘I’m afraid it was all my fault.’
“我非常抱歉——非常抱歉，”赫敏重复道。 “恐怕这都是我的错。”

‘It’s of no importance—really, I assure you—it doesn’t matter in the least,’ said Gudrun loudly, with emphasis, her face flushed scarlet. And she held out her hand impatiently for the wet book, to have done with the scene. Gerald gave it to her. He was not quite himself.
“这不重要——真的，我向你保证——一点也不重要，”古珍大声说道，强调着，她的脸涨得通红。她不耐烦地伸出手去拿那本湿漉漉的书，结束这个场景。杰拉尔德把它给了她。他不太像他自己了。

‘I’m so dreadfully sorry,’ repeated Hermione, till both Gerald and Gudrun were exasperated. ‘Is there nothing that can be done?’
“我非常抱歉，”赫敏重复道，直到杰拉尔德和古德伦都被激怒了。 “没有什么可以做的吗？”

‘In what way?’ asked Gudrun, with cool irony.
“以什么方式？”古德伦问道，语气冷酷讽刺。

‘Can’t we save the drawings?’
“我们不能保存图纸吗？”

There was a moment’s pause, wherein Gudrun made evident all her refutation of Hermione’s persistence.
停顿了一会儿，古德伦明显地反驳了赫敏的坚持。

‘I assure you,’ said Gudrun, with cutting distinctness, ‘the drawings are quite as good as ever they were, for my purpose. I want them only for reference.’
“我向你保证，”古德伦语气清晰地说，“对我来说，这些图画和以前一样好。”我只想要它们作为参考。

‘But can’t I give you a new book? I wish you’d let me do that. I feel so truly sorry. I feel it was all my fault.’
“但是我不能给你一本新书吗？我希望你能让我这么做。我真的感到非常抱歉。我觉得这都是我的错。

‘As far as I saw,’ said Gudrun, ‘it wasn’t your fault at all. If there was any FAULT, it was Mr Crich’s. But the whole thing is ENTIRELY trivial, and it really is ridiculous to take any notice of it.’
“据我所知，”古德伦说，“这根本不是你的错。如果说有什么过错的话，那也是克里奇先生的错。但这整件事完全是微不足道的，对它进行任何关注确实是荒谬的。”

Gerald watched Gudrun closely, whilst she repulsed Hermione. There was a body of cold power in her. He watched her with an insight that amounted to clairvoyance. He saw her a dangerous, hostile spirit, that could stand undiminished and unabated. It was so finished, and of such perfect gesture, moreover.
杰拉尔德密切注视着古德伦，而她则拒绝了赫敏。她的身上，有着一股冰冷的力量。他用一种相当于千里眼的洞察力看着她。他在她身上看到了一种危险的、充满敌意的精神，这种精神可以丝毫不减、不减。它已经完成了，而且姿态也如此完美。

‘I’m awfully glad if it doesn’t matter,’ he said; ‘if there’s no real harm done.’
“如果没关系的话，我非常高兴，”他说。 “如果没有造成真正的伤害的话。”

She looked back at him, with her fine blue eyes, and signalled full into his spirit, as she said, her voice ringing with intimacy almost caressive now it was addressed to him:
她回头看着他，用她漂亮的蓝眼睛，向他的精神发出了完全的信号，正如她所说，她的声音充满了亲密，几乎是爱抚，现在这是对他说的：

‘Of course, it doesn’t matter in the LEAST.’
“当然，这根本不重要。”

The bond was established between them, in that look, in her tone. In her tone, she made the understanding clear—they were of the same kind, he and she, a sort of diabolic freemasonry subsisted between them. Henceforward, she knew, she had her power over him. Wherever they met, they would be secretly associated. And he would be helpless in the association with her. Her soul exulted.
他们之间的联系是从她的眼神、她的语气中建立起来的。她的语气里已经明白了——他和她是同一类人，他们之间存在着一种恶魔般的共济会。从那时起，她知道，她对他拥有了力量。无论在哪里见面，他们都会秘密交往。而和她交往，他就会束手无策。她的灵魂欢欣鼓舞。

‘Good-bye! I’m so glad you forgive me. Gooood-bye!’
'再见！我很高兴你能原谅我。再见！’

Hermione sang her farewell, and waved her hand. Gerald automatically took the oar and pushed off. But he was looking all the time, with a glimmering, subtly-smiling admiration in his eyes, at Gudrun, who stood on the shoal shaking the wet book in her hand. She turned away and ignored the receding boat. But Gerald looked back as he rowed, beholding her, forgetting what he was doing.
赫敏唱了告别歌，并挥了挥手。杰拉德自动划起桨，划开。但他始终注视着站在浅滩上、手里摇晃着湿漉漉的书的古德伦，眼里闪烁着微光，带着微妙的微笑。她转过身去，无视那远去的船。但杰拉尔德划船时回头看着她，忘记了自己在做什么。

‘Aren’t we going too much to the left?’ sang Hermione, as she sat ignored under her coloured parasol.
“我们是不是太左了？”赫敏唱道，她坐在彩色遮阳伞下，无人理睬。

Gerald looked round without replying, the oars balanced and glancing in the sun.
杰拉尔德环顾四周，没有回答，桨保持平衡，在阳光下闪闪发亮。

‘I think it’s all right,’ he said good-humouredly, beginning to row again without thinking of what he was doing. And Hermione disliked him extremely for his good-humoured obliviousness, she was nullified, she could not regain ascendancy.
“我想没关系，”他幽默地说，并没有考虑自己在做什么，又开始划船。而赫敏极其不喜欢他的好脾气的健忘，她被取消了，她无法重新获得优势。

CHAPTER XI
第十一章

AN ISLAND
一个岛屿

Meanwhile Ursula had wandered on from Willey Water along the course of the bright little stream. The afternoon was full of larks’ singing. On the bright hill-sides was a subdued smoulder of gorse. A few forget-me-nots flowered by the water. There was a rousedness and a glancing everywhere.
与此同时，乌苏拉从威利沃特出发，沿着明亮的小溪流继续漫步。下午充满了百灵鸟的歌声。明亮的山坡上长满了郁郁葱葱的金雀花。水边开着几朵勿忘我花。到处都是一种兴奋和目光。

She strayed absorbedly on, over the brooks. She wanted to go to the mill-pond above. The big mill-house was deserted, save for a labourer and his wife who lived in the kitchen. So she passed through the empty farm-yard and through the wilderness of a garden, and mounted the bank by the sluice. When she got to the top, to see the old, velvety surface of the pond before her, she noticed a man on the bank, tinkering with a punt. It was Birkin sawing and hammering away.
她全神贯注地越过小溪继续前行。她想去上面的磨坊池塘。大磨坊里空无一人，只剩下一名工人和他的妻子住在厨房里。于是她穿过空荡荡的农家院子，穿过花园的荒野，登上水闸旁的岸边。当她到达山顶时，看到面前池塘古老而柔软的水面，她注意到岸边有一个人正在摆弄平底船。这是伯金锯和锤击的过程。

She stood at the head of the sluice, looking at him. He was unaware of anybody’s presence. He looked very busy, like a wild animal, active and intent. She felt she ought to go away, he would not want her. He seemed to be so much occupied. But she did not want to go away. Therefore she moved along the bank till he would look up.
她站在水闸的顶端，看着他。他不知道有人在场。他看起来很忙碌，就像一头野生动物，活跃而专注。她觉得她应该离开，他不会要她。他似乎很忙。但她不想离开。于是她沿着河岸移动，直到他抬起头来。

Which he soon did. The moment he saw her, he dropped his tools and came forward, saying:
他很快就做到了。他一看到她，就放下工具，上前道：

‘How do you do? I’m making the punt water-tight. Tell me if you think it is right.’
'你好吗？我正在让平底船不漏水。告诉我你是否认为这是对的。

She went along with him.
她和他一起去了。

‘You are your father’s daughter, so you can tell me if it will do,’ he said.
“你是你父亲的女儿，所以你可以告诉我是否可行，”他说。

She bent to look at the patched punt.
她弯下腰看那只打过补丁的平底船。

‘I am sure I am my father’s daughter,’ she said, fearful of having to judge. ‘But I don’t know anything about carpentry. It LOOKS right, don’t you think?’
“我确信我是我父亲的女儿，”她说，害怕不得不做出判断。 “但我对木工一无所知。看起来不错，你不觉得吗？

‘Yes, I think. I hope it won’t let me to the bottom, that’s all. Though even so, it isn’t a great matter, I should come up again. Help me to get it into the water, will you?’
'是的，我认为。我希望它不会让我跌入谷底，仅此而已。虽说如此，也不是什么大事，我还是得再上来。帮我把它放进水里，好吗？

With combined efforts they turned over the heavy punt and set it afloat.
经过共同努力，他们把沉重的平底船翻了过来，让它浮了起来。

‘Now,’ he said, ‘I’ll try it and you can watch what happens. Then if it carries, I’ll take you over to the island.’
“现在，”他说，“我会尝试一下，你可以看看会发生什么。”如果有的话，我就带你去岛上。”

‘Do,’ she cried, watching anxiously.
“做，”她喊道，焦急地看着。

The pond was large, and had that perfect stillness and the dark lustre of very deep water. There were two small islands overgrown with bushes and a few trees, towards the middle. Birkin pushed himself off, and veered clumsily in the pond. Luckily the punt drifted so that he could catch hold of a willow bough, and pull it to the island.
池塘很大，非常安静，水很深，泛着黑色的光泽。中间有两个小岛，长满了灌木丛和几棵树。伯金推开自己，在池塘里笨拙地转向。幸运的是，平底船漂了，他能够抓住一根柳树枝，把它拉到岛上。

‘Rather overgrown,’ he said, looking into the interior, ‘but very nice. I’ll come and fetch you. The boat leaks a little.’
“相当杂草丛生，”他看着内部说道，“但非常好。”我来接你。船有点漏了。”

In a moment he was with her again, and she stepped into the wet punt.
过了一会儿，他又回到了她身边，她踏进了湿漉漉的平底船。

‘It’ll float us all right,’ he said, and manoeuvred again to the island.
“它会让我们顺利漂浮的，”他说，然后再次操纵到岛上。

They landed under a willow tree. She shrank from the little jungle of rank plants before her, evil-smelling figwort and hemlock. But he explored into it.
他们降落在一棵柳树下。她从面前的小丛林中退缩了，里面长满了臭气熏天的玄参和铁杉等植物。但他对此进行了探索。

‘I shall mow this down,’ he said, ‘and then it will be romantic—like Paul et Virginie.’
“我要把它砍掉，”他说，“然后它就会变得浪漫起来——就像保罗和维吉妮一样。”

‘Yes, one could have lovely Watteau picnics here,’ cried Ursula with enthusiasm.
“是的，人们可以在这里享受可爱的华托野餐，”乌苏拉热情地喊道。

His face darkened.
他的脸色沉了下来。

‘I don’t want Watteau picnics here,’ he said.
“我不想让华托在这里野餐，”他说。

‘Only your Virginie,’ she laughed.
“只有你的维吉妮，”她笑道。

‘Virginie enough,’ he smiled wryly. ‘No, I don’t want her either.’
“维吉妮够了，”他苦笑道。 “不，我也不想要她。”

Ursula looked at him closely. She had not seen him since Breadalby. He was very thin and hollow, with a ghastly look in his face.
乌苏拉仔细地看着他。自从布雷多尔比之后，她就没见过他。他很瘦，很空虚，脸上的表情十分阴森。

‘You have been ill; haven’t you?’ she asked, rather repulsed.
‘你病了；你不是吗？”她颇为反感地问道。

‘Yes,’ he replied coldly.
“是的。”他冷冷地回答。

They had sat down under the willow tree, and were looking at the pond, from their retreat on the island.
他们在岛上的隐居地坐在柳树下，看着池塘。

‘Has it made you frightened?’ she asked.
“这让你感到害怕吗？”她问。

‘What of?’ he asked, turning his eyes to look at her. Something in him, inhuman and unmitigated, disturbed her, and shook her out of her ordinary self.
“什么？”他问道，转过眼睛看着她。他身上的某种东西，非人性的、彻底的，扰乱了她，使她脱离了平常的自我。

‘It IS frightening to be very ill, isn’t it?’ she said.
“病得很重很可怕，不是吗？”她说。

‘It isn’t pleasant,’ he said. ‘Whether one is really afraid of death, or not, I have never decided. In one mood, not a bit, in another, very much.’
“这并不令人愉快，”他说。 “到底是不是真的怕死，我从来没有决定过。在一种心情下，一点也不，在另一种心情下，非常多。

‘But doesn’t it make you feel ashamed? I think it makes one so ashamed, to be ill—illness is so terribly humiliating, don’t you think?’
‘可是这不让你感到羞耻吗？我认为生病会让一个人感到羞耻——疾病是一种非常可怕的羞辱，你不觉得吗？

He considered for some minutes.
他考虑了几分钟。

‘May-be,’ he said. ‘Though one knows all the time one’s life isn’t really right, at the source. That’s the humiliation. I don’t see that the illness counts so much, after that. One is ill because one doesn’t live properly—can’t. It’s the failure to live that makes one ill, and humiliates one.’
“也许吧，”他说。 “尽管人们一直都知道自己的生活从一开始就不太对劲。这就是屈辱。在那之后，我不认为疾病有那么重要。一个人生病是因为他没有好好地生活——不能。生活的失败会让人生病，让人感到羞辱。”

‘But do you fail to live?’ she asked, almost jeering.
“但是你活不下去了吗？”她问道，几乎是在嘲笑。

‘Why yes—I don’t make much of a success of my days. One seems always to be bumping one’s nose against the blank wall ahead.’
‘为什么是的——我这一天并没有取得多大的成功。人们似乎总是把鼻子撞到前面的空白墙上。

Ursula laughed. She was frightened, and when she was frightened she always laughed and pretended to be jaunty.
乌苏拉笑了。她很害怕，而当她害怕的时候，她总是笑起来，装出一副得意洋洋的样子。

‘Your poor nose!’ she said, looking at that feature of his face.
“你可怜的鼻子！”她看着他脸上的那个特征说道。

‘No wonder it’s ugly,’ he replied.
“难怪它很丑，”他回答道。

She was silent for some minutes, struggling with her own self-deception. It was an instinct in her, to deceive herself.
她沉默了几分钟，与自己的自欺欺人作斗争。这是她的本能，欺骗自己。

‘But I’M happy—I think life is AWFULLY jolly,’ she said.
“但我很高兴——我认为生活非常快乐，”她说。

‘Good,’ he answered, with a certain cold indifference.
“很好，”他回答道，语气里带着一丝冷漠。

She reached for a bit of paper which had wrapped a small piece of chocolate she had found in her pocket, and began making a boat. He watched her without heeding her. There was something strangely pathetic and tender in her moving, unconscious finger-tips, that were agitated and hurt, really.
她伸手拿了一张纸，上面包裹着她在口袋里找到的一小块巧克力，然后开始制作一艘船。他看着她，没有理睬她。她移动的、无意识的指尖有一种奇怪的可怜和温柔，真的很激动和受伤。

‘I DO enjoy things—don’t you?’ she asked.
“我确实喜欢事物——你呢？”她问道。

‘Oh yes! But it infuriates me that I can’t get right, at the really growing part of me. I feel all tangled and messed up, and I CAN’T get straight anyhow. I don’t know what really to DO. One must do something somewhere.’
'哦是的！但令我愤怒的是，在我真正成长的部分，我却无法做到正确。我感觉自己很纠结，很混乱，无论如何也无法理清思路。我不知道到底该做什么。人们必须在某个地方做点什么。

‘Why should you always be DOING?’ she retorted. ‘It is so plebeian. I think it is much better to be really patrician, and to do nothing but just be oneself, like a walking flower.’
“你为什么要一直做事？”她反驳道。 ‘这太平民化了。我认为做一个真正的贵族要好得多，什么也不做，只做自己，就像一朵会走路的花。

‘I quite agree,’ he said, ‘if one has burst into blossom. But I can’t get my flower to blossom anyhow. Either it is blighted in the bud, or has got the smother-fly, or it isn’t nourished. Curse it, it isn’t even a bud. It is a contravened knot.’
“我完全同意，”他说，“如果一朵花已经绽放了。”但我无论如何也无法让我的花绽放。要么是在花蕾中就枯萎了，要么是得了闷蝇，要么是没有得到滋养。诅咒它，它甚至不是一个花蕾。这是一个违例的结。

Again she laughed. He was so very fretful and exasperated. But she was anxious and puzzled. How was one to get out, anyhow. There must be a way out somewhere.
她又笑了。他非常烦躁和恼怒。但她却又焦急又困惑。无论如何，一个人要如何出去呢？一定有什么地方可以出去。

There was a silence, wherein she wanted to cry. She reached for another bit of chocolate paper, and began to fold another boat.
一阵沉默，她想哭。她伸手去拿另一张巧克力纸，开始折另一条船。

‘And why is it,’ she asked at length, ‘that there is no flowering, no dignity of human life now?’
“为什么，”她最后问道，“现在人类的生命没有繁荣，没有尊严？”

‘The whole idea is dead. Humanity itself is dry-rotten, really. There are myriads of human beings hanging on the bush—and they look very nice and rosy, your healthy young men and women. But they are apples of Sodom, as a matter of fact, Dead Sea Fruit, gall-apples. It isn’t true that they have any significance—their insides are full of bitter, corrupt ash.’
'整个想法已经死了。人类本身确实已经干枯腐烂了。有无数的人挂在灌木丛上——他们看起来非常漂亮，面色红润，健康的年轻男女。但它们是所多玛的苹果，事实上，死海果，五倍子。它们并不具有任何意义——它们的内部充满了苦涩、腐败的灰烬。

‘But there ARE good people,’ protested Ursula.
“但是也有好人，”乌苏拉抗议道。

‘Good enough for the life of today. But mankind is a dead tree, covered with fine brilliant galls of people.’
‘对于今天的生活来说已经足够了。但人类是一棵枯树，上面长满了美丽而明亮的人瘿。”

Ursula could not help stiffening herself against this, it was too picturesque and final. But neither could she help making him go on.
乌苏拉不禁僵硬起来，这实在是太风景如画、太最终了。但她也无法阻止他继续说下去。

‘And if it is so, WHY is it?’ she asked, hostile. They were rousing each other to a fine passion of opposition.
“如果是这样，为什么会这样呢？”她充满敌意地问道。他们互相煽动着一种强烈的反对热情。

‘Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust? Because they won’t fall off the tree when they’re ripe. They hang on to their old positions when the position is over-past, till they become infested with little worms and dry-rot.’
‘为什么，为什么人都是苦涩的尘埃球？因为它们成熟后不会从树上掉下来。当位置过去时，它们会坚持原来的位置，直到它们被小虫子侵扰并干腐为止。

There was a long pause. His voice had become hot and very sarcastic. Ursula was troubled and bewildered, they were both oblivious of everything but their own immersion.
出现了长时间的停顿。他的声音变得炙热，而且十分讽刺。乌苏拉感到困扰和困惑，他们都忘记了一切，除了自己的沉浸。

‘But even if everybody is wrong—where are you right?’ she cried, ‘where are you any better?’
“但即使每个人都错了——你哪里是对的？”她喊道，“你哪里更好了？”

‘I?—I’m not right,’ he cried back. ‘At least my only rightness lies in the fact that I know it. I detest what I am, outwardly. I loathe myself as a human being. Humanity is a huge aggregate lie, and a huge lie is less than a small truth. Humanity is less, far less than the individual, because the individual may sometimes be capable of truth, and humanity is a tree of lies. And they say that love is the greatest thing; they persist in SAYING this, the foul liars, and just look at what they do! Look at all the millions of people who repeat every minute that love is the greatest, and charity is the greatest—and see what they are doing all the time. By their works ye shall know them, for dirty liars and cowards, who daren’t stand by their own actions, much less by their own words.’
“我？——我不对，”他喊道。 “至少我唯一的正确之处在于我知道这一点。我讨厌外表上的自己。我厌恶自己作为一个人。人性是一个巨大的谎言集合体，而一个巨大的谎言还不如一个小小的真理。人性比个人少得多，远远少得多，因为个人有时可能有能力说出真理，而人性是一棵谎言之树。他们说爱是最伟大的事情；他们坚持说这些，这些卑鄙的骗子，看看他们做了什么！看看数以百万计的人，他们每时每刻都在重复爱是最伟大的，慈善是最伟大的——看看他们一直在做什么。通过他们的行为，你们就会知道他们是卑鄙的骗子和懦夫，他们不敢坚持自己的行为，更不用说坚持自己的言论了。

‘But,’ said Ursula sadly, ‘that doesn’t alter the fact that love is the greatest, does it? What they DO doesn’t alter the truth of what they say, does it?’
“但是，”乌苏拉悲伤地说，“这并不能改变爱是最伟大的事实，不是吗？他们所做的并不会改变他们所说的真相，不是吗？

‘Completely, because if what they say WERE true, then they couldn’t help fulfilling it. But they maintain a lie, and so they run amok at last. It’s a lie to say that love is the greatest. You might as well say that hate is the greatest, since the opposite of everything balances. What people want is hate—hate and nothing but hate. And in the name of righteousness and love, they get it. They distil themselves with nitroglycerine, all the lot of them, out of very love. It’s the lie that kills. If we want hate, let us have it—death, murder, torture, violent destruction—let us have it: but not in the name of love. But I abhor humanity, I wish it was swept away. It could go, and there would be no ABSOLUTE loss, if every human being perished tomorrow. The reality would be untouched. Nay, it would be better. The real tree of life would then be rid of the most ghastly, heavy crop of Dead Sea Fruit, the intolerable burden of myriad simulacra of people, an infinite weight of mortal lies.’
“完全是这样，因为如果他们说的是真的，那么他们就会情不自禁地去实现它。但他们却一直撒谎，所以最后他们就发飙了。说爱是最伟大的，那是谎言。你不妨说，仇恨是最大的，因为一切事物的对立面都是平衡的。人们想要的是仇恨——仇恨，除了仇恨什么也没有。以正义和爱的名义，他们得到了它。他们用硝化甘油蒸馏自己，所有这些，都是出于非常的爱。这是致命的谎言。如果我们想要仇恨，那就让我们拥有它——死亡、谋杀、酷刑、暴力破坏——让我们拥有它：但不是以爱的名义。但我憎恶人性，我希望它被扫除。它可以消失，即使明天每个人都死去，也不会有绝对的损失。现实不会受到影响。不，这样会更好。真正的生命之树将摆脱最可怕、最沉重的死海水果、无数人的拟像的难以忍受的负担、以及无限重的致命谎言。

‘So you’d like everybody in the world destroyed?’ said Ursula.
“所以你希望世界上的每个人都被毁灭？”乌苏拉说。

‘I should indeed.’
“我确实应该这么做。”

‘And the world empty of people?’
“那么世界上就没有人了吗？”

‘Yes truly. You yourself, don’t you find it a beautiful clean thought, a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up?’
是的，确实如此。你自己，难道不觉得这是一个美丽而干净的想法吗？一个空无一人的世界，只有连绵不断的草地，还有一只坐着的野兔？

The pleasant sincerity of his voice made Ursula pause to consider her own proposition. And really it WAS attractive: a clean, lovely, humanless world. It was the REALLY desirable. Her heart hesitated, and exulted. But still, she was dissatisfied with HIM.
他声音中令人愉悦的真诚让乌苏拉停下来考虑自己的提议。它确实很有吸引力：一个干净、可爱、无人的世界。这是真正令人向往的。她的心犹豫了一下，又欣喜若狂。但她仍然对HIM不满意。

‘But,’ she objected, ‘you’d be dead yourself, so what good would it do you?’
“但是，”她反对道，“你自己就死了，那对你有什么好处呢？”

‘I would die like a shot, to know that the earth would really be cleaned of all the people. It is the most beautiful and freeing thought. Then there would NEVER be another foul humanity created, for a universal defilement.’
“如果我知道地球上的所有人类真的会被清除，我会像子弹一样死去。”这是最美丽、最自由的思想。那么就永远不会再有一个肮脏的人类被创造出来，造成普遍的污秽。”

‘No,’ said Ursula, ‘there would be nothing.’
“不，”乌苏拉说，“不会有什么。”

‘What! Nothing? Just because humanity was wiped out? You flatter yourself. There’d be everything.’
'什么！没有什么？就因为人类被消灭了？你还自吹自擂。一切都会有的。

‘But how, if there were no people?’
“但是，如果没有人怎么办？”

‘Do you think that creation depends on MAN! It merely doesn’t. There are the trees and the grass and birds. I much prefer to think of the lark rising up in the morning upon a human-less world. Man is a mistake, he must go. There is the grass, and hares and adders, and the unseen hosts, actual angels that go about freely when a dirty humanity doesn’t interrupt them—and good pure-tissued demons: very nice.’
‘你认为创造取决于人吗！事实并非如此。有树、有草、有鸟。我更喜欢想象早晨在无人的世界上升起的云雀。人就是一个错误，他必须走。有草、野兔和毒蛇，还有看不见的宿主，当肮脏的人类不打扰他们时，真正的天使可以自由活动——还有善良的纯组织恶魔：非常好。

It pleased Ursula, what he said, pleased her very much, as a phantasy. Of course it was only a pleasant fancy. She herself knew too well the actuality of humanity, its hideous actuality. She knew it could not disappear so cleanly and conveniently. It had a long way to go yet, a long and hideous way. Her subtle, feminine, demoniacal soul knew it well.
这让乌苏拉很高兴，他所说的话，让她非常高兴，就像一种幻想。当然，这只是一个愉快的幻想。她自己太了解人性的现实，它的可怕的现实。她知道它不可能消失得这么干净利落。还有很长的路要走，一条漫长而可怕的路。她那微妙、女性化、恶魔般的灵魂深知这一点。

‘If only man was swept off the face of the earth, creation would go on so marvellously, with a new start, non-human. Man is one of the mistakes of creation—like the ichthyosauri. If only he were gone again, think what lovely things would come out of the liberated days;—things straight out of the fire.’
“只要人类从地球表面消失，创造就会如此奇妙地继续下去，以一个新的开始，非人类。”人类是造物的错误之一——就像鱼龙一样。如果他再次离开，想象一下解放的日子会产生多么可爱的东西；——直接从火中出来的东西。

‘But man will never be gone,’ she said, with insidious, diabolical knowledge of the horrors of persistence. ‘The world will go with him.’
“但人类永远不会消失，”她说道，带着对坚持的恐怖的阴险、恶魔般的了解。 “世界将与他同行。”

‘Ah no,’ he answered, ‘not so. I believe in the proud angels and the demons that are our fore-runners. They will destroy us, because we are not proud enough. The ichthyosauri were not proud: they crawled and floundered as we do. And besides, look at elder-flowers and bluebells—they are a sign that pure creation takes place—even the butterfly. But humanity never gets beyond the caterpillar stage—it rots in the chrysalis, it never will have wings. It is anti-creation, like monkeys and baboons.’
“啊不，”他回答说，“不是这样的。”我相信骄傲的天使和恶魔是我们的先行者。他们会毁灭我们，因为我们不够骄傲。鱼龙并不骄傲：它们像我们一样爬行和挣扎。此外，看看接骨木花和风信子——它们是纯粹创造发生的标志——甚至是蝴蝶。但人类永远无法超越毛虫阶段——它会在蛹中腐烂，永远不会有翅膀。它是反创造的，就像猴子和狒狒一样。”

Ursula watched him as he talked. There seemed a certain impatient fury in him, all the while, and at the same time a great amusement in everything, and a final tolerance. And it was this tolerance she mistrusted, not the fury. She saw that, all the while, in spite of himself, he would have to be trying to save the world. And this knowledge, whilst it comforted her heart somewhere with a little self-satisfaction, stability, yet filled her with a certain sharp contempt and hate of him. She wanted him to herself, she hated the Salvator Mundi touch. It was something diffuse and generalised about him, which she could not stand. He would behave in the same way, say the same things, give himself as completely to anybody who came along, anybody and everybody who liked to appeal to him. It was despicable, a very insidious form of prostitution.
乌苏拉看着他说话。他身上似乎始终有一种不耐烦的愤怒，同时又对一切感到极大的乐趣，以及最后的宽容。她不信任的是这种宽容，而不是愤怒。她看到，无论他自己如何，他都必须一直努力拯救世界。而这个认知，虽然让她心里有些许的满足和安定，却又让她心中充满了对他的某种尖锐的蔑视和憎恨。她想要他属于自己，她讨厌《救世主》的接触。他身上有一种弥漫而普遍的东西，这是她无法忍受的。他会以同样的方式行事，说同样的话，将自己完全奉献给任何前来的人，任何喜欢吸引他的人。这是卑鄙的，是一种非常阴险的卖淫形式。

‘But,’ she said, ‘you believe in individual love, even if you don’t believe in loving humanity—?’
“但是，”她说，“你相信个人之爱，即使你不相信爱人类——？”

‘I don’t believe in love at all—that is, any more than I believe in hate, or in grief. Love is one of the emotions like all the others—and so it is all right whilst you feel it But I can’t see how it becomes an absolute. It is just part of human relationships, no more. And it is only part of ANY human relationship. And why one should be required ALWAYS to feel it, any more than one always feels sorrow or distant joy, I cannot conceive. Love isn’t a desideratum—it is an emotion you feel or you don’t feel, according to circumstance.’
“我根本不相信爱——也就是说，就像我不相信仇恨或悲伤一样。爱是一种情感，就像所有其他情感一样——所以当你感受到它时没关系，但我不明白它如何变得绝对。这只是人际关系的一部分，仅此而已。它只是任何人际关系的一部分。为什么人们总是需要感受到它，就像人们总是感到悲伤或遥远的快乐一样，我无法想象。爱不是一种渴望——它是一种你能感受到或没有感受到的情感，取决于具体情况。

‘Then why do you care about people at all?’ she asked, ‘if you don’t believe in love? Why do you bother about humanity?’
“那你为什么还要关心别人呢？”她问道，“如果你不相信爱情？你为什么关心人性？

‘Why do I? Because I can’t get away from it.’
'我为什么会？因为我无法摆脱它。

‘Because you love it,’ she persisted.
“因为你喜欢它，”她坚持道。

It irritated him.
这激怒了他。

‘If I do love it,’ he said, ‘it is my disease.’
“如果我真的喜欢它，”他说，“那就是我的病。”

‘But it is a disease you don’t want to be cured of,’ she said, with some cold sneering.
“但这是一种你不想治愈的疾病，”她冷笑着说道。

He was silent now, feeling she wanted to insult him.
他现在沉默了，感觉她想侮辱他。

‘And if you don’t believe in love, what DO you believe in?’ she asked mocking. ‘Simply in the end of the world, and grass?’
“如果你不相信爱情，那你还相信什么？”她嘲讽地问道。 “就在世界的尽头，还有草？”

He was beginning to feel a fool.
他开始觉得自己是个傻瓜。

‘I believe in the unseen hosts,’ he said.
“我相信看不见的主人，”他说。

‘And nothing else? You believe in nothing visible, except grass and birds? Your world is a poor show.’
‘还有别的事吗？除了草和鸟，你不相信任何可见的东西？你的世界是一场糟糕的表演。

‘Perhaps it is,’ he said, cool and superior now he was offended, assuming a certain insufferable aloof superiority, and withdrawing into his distance.
“也许是这样，”他说道，冷静而优越，现在他被冒犯了，呈现出某种令人难以忍受的超然优越感，并退到了他的距离之外。

Ursula disliked him. But also she felt she had lost something. She looked at him as he sat crouched on the bank. There was a certain priggish Sunday-school stiffness over him, priggish and detestable. And yet, at the same time, the moulding of him was so quick and attractive, it gave such a great sense of freedom: the moulding of his brows, his chin, his whole physique, something so alive, somewhere, in spite of the look of sickness.
乌苏拉不喜欢他。但她也觉得自己失去了一些东西。当他蹲在岸边时，她看着他。他身上有一种主日学校的那种自以为是的僵硬，自负而令人厌恶。然而，与此同时，他的塑造是如此迅速和有吸引力，它给人一种如此巨大的自由感：他的眉毛、他的下巴、他的整个体格的塑造，是那么有活力，在某个地方，尽管生病的样子。

And it was this duality in feeling which he created in her, that made a fine hate of him quicken in her bowels. There was his wonderful, desirable life-rapidity, the rare quality of an utterly desirable man: and there was at the same time this ridiculous, mean effacement into a Salvator Mundi and a Sunday-school teacher, a prig of the stiffest type.
正是他在她身上造成的这种二元性的感觉，使她内心对他产生了强烈的仇恨。他有着美妙的、令人向往的生活节奏，这是一个完全令人向往的男人的罕见品质：同时，他又荒唐而卑鄙地抹杀了救世主和主日学校的老师，是一位最刻板的一本正经的人。

He looked up at her. He saw her face strangely enkindled, as if suffused from within by a powerful sweet fire. His soul was arrested in wonder. She was enkindled in her own living fire. Arrested in wonder and in pure, perfect attraction, he moved towards her. She sat like a strange queen, almost supernatural in her glowing smiling richness.
他抬头看着她。他看到她的脸奇怪地燃烧起来，仿佛从里面充满了一股强大而甜蜜的火焰。他的灵魂因惊奇而被囚禁。她被自己的生命之火点燃了。他被惊奇和纯粹、完美的吸引所吸引，向她走去。她坐着，就像一位奇怪的女王，笑容灿烂，富丽堂皇，几乎是超自然的。

‘The point about love,’ he said, his consciousness quickly adjusting itself, ‘is that we hate the word because we have vulgarised it. It ought to be prescribed, tabooed from utterance, for many years, till we get a new, better idea.’
“关于爱的要点，”他说，他的意识迅速自我调整，“我们讨厌这个词，因为我们把它庸俗化了。它应该被规定，禁止言论，多年，直到我们得到一个新的、更好的想法。

There was a beam of understanding between them.
他们之间有一丝默契。

‘But it always means the same thing,’ she said.
“但它总是意味着同样的事情，”她说。

‘Ah God, no, let it not mean that any more,’ he cried. ‘Let the old meanings go.’
“啊上帝，不，别再这样了，”他喊道。 “让旧的意义消失吧。”

‘But still it is love,’ she persisted. A strange, wicked yellow light shone at him in her eyes.
“但这仍然是爱，”她坚持道。她的眼中闪烁着奇异而邪恶的黄色光芒。

He hesitated, baffled, withdrawing.
他犹豫、困惑、退缩。

‘No,’ he said, ‘it isn’t. Spoken like that, never in the world. You’ve no business to utter the word.’
“不，”他说，“不是这样。”世界上从来没有这样说话。你没有资格说这个词。

‘I must leave it to you, to take it out of the Ark of the Covenant at the right moment,’ she mocked.
“我必须把它留给你，在适当的时候把它从约柜里拿出来，”她嘲笑道。

Again they looked at each other. She suddenly sprang up, turned her back to him, and walked away. He too rose slowly and went to the water’s edge, where, crouching, he began to amuse himself unconsciously. Picking a daisy he dropped it on the pond, so that the stem was a keel, the flower floated like a little water lily, staring with its open face up to the sky. It turned slowly round, in a slow, slow Dervish dance, as it veered away.
他们再次互相看了看。她突然跳了起来，背对着他，走开了。他也慢慢起身，来到水边，蹲下身子，不自觉地自娱自乐起来。他摘下一朵雏菊，把它扔到池塘里，把茎当作龙骨，花儿像一朵小睡莲一样漂浮着，张开脸庞，凝视着天空。它慢慢地转过身来，以一种缓慢、缓慢的苦行僧舞蹈，然后转向离开。

He watched it, then dropped another daisy into the water, and after that another, and sat watching them with bright, absolved eyes, crouching near on the bank. Ursula turned to look. A strange feeling possessed her, as if something were taking place. But it was all intangible. And some sort of control was being put on her. She could not know. She could only watch the brilliant little discs of the daisies veering slowly in travel on the dark, lustrous water. The little flotilla was drifting into the light, a company of white specks in the distance.
他看着它，然后把另一朵雏菊扔进水里，然后又扔下一朵，然后蹲在岸边，用明亮、宽恕的眼睛看着他们。乌苏拉转头看去。一种奇怪的感觉袭上她的心头，仿佛有什么事情正在发生。但这一切都是无形的。她受到了某种控制。她不知道。她只能看着雏菊明亮的小圆盘在漆黑、有光泽的水面上缓慢转动。小船队正漂入光亮中，远处有一群白色的斑点。

‘Do let us go to the shore, to follow them,’ she said, afraid of being any longer imprisoned on the island. And they pushed off in the punt.
“让我们到岸边去追他们吧，”她说道，害怕再被囚禁在岛上。他们把平底船推开。

She was glad to be on the free land again. She went along the bank towards the sluice. The daisies were scattered broadcast on the pond, tiny radiant things, like an exaltation, points of exaltation here and there. Why did they move her so strongly and mystically?
她很高兴再次踏上自由的土地。她沿着河岸向水闸走去。池塘上散布着雏菊，小小的、闪闪发光的东西，就像一种兴奋，到处都是兴奋的点。为什么他们如此强烈而神秘地感动了她？

‘Look,’ he said, ‘your boat of purple paper is escorting them, and they are a convoy of rafts.’
他说：“你看，你的紫纸船正在护送他们，他们是一队木筏。”

Some of the daisies came slowly towards her, hesitating, making a shy bright little cotillion on the dark clear water. Their gay bright candour moved her so much as they came near, that she was almost in tears.
一些雏菊慢慢地向她走来，犹豫着，在漆黑清澈的水面上组成了一个羞涩而明亮的小舞会。当他们走近时，他们欢快、明亮的坦诚让她非常感动，她几乎哭了。

‘Why are they so lovely,’ she cried. ‘Why do I think them so lovely?’
“为什么它们这么可爱，”她哭道。 “为什么我觉得它们这么可爱？”

‘They are nice flowers,’ he said, her emotional tones putting a constraint on him.
“它们是漂亮的花，”他说，她情绪化的语气让他感到拘束。

‘You know that a daisy is a company of florets, a concourse, become individual. Don’t the botanists put it highest in the line of development? I believe they do.’
“你知道，雏菊是一群小花的陪伴，一个广场，成为一个个体。难道植物学家不是把它放在发展路线的最高位置吗？我相信他们会的。

‘The compositae, yes, I think so,’ said Ursula, who was never very sure of anything. Things she knew perfectly well, at one moment, seemed to become doubtful the next.
“菊科植物，是的，我想是的，”乌苏拉说道，她对任何事情都不太确定。她所熟知的事情，在某一时刻似乎变得令人怀疑。

‘Explain it so, then,’ he said. ‘The daisy is a perfect little democracy, so it’s the highest of flowers, hence its charm.’
“那么解释一下吧，”他说。 “雏菊是一种完美的小民主，所以它是花朵中最高的，因此有它的魅力。”

‘No,’ she cried, ‘no—never. It isn’t democratic.’
“不，”她喊道，“不——从来没有。”这不是民主的。

‘No,’ he admitted. ‘It’s the golden mob of the proletariat, surrounded by a showy white fence of the idle rich.’
“不，”他承认。 “这是无产阶级的金色暴民，周围是游手好闲的富人华丽的白色栅栏。”

‘How hateful—your hateful social orders!’ she cried.
“多么可恶——你们可恶的社会秩序！”她喊道。

‘Quite! It’s a daisy—we’ll leave it alone.’
'相当！这是一朵雏菊——我们不会管它。

‘Do. Let it be a dark horse for once,’ she said: ‘if anything can be a dark horse to you,’ she added satirically.
'做。让它成为一匹黑马吧，”她说，“如果有什么东西对你来说可以成为一匹黑马的话，”她讽刺地补充道。

They stood aside, forgetful. As if a little stunned, they both were motionless, barely conscious. The little conflict into which they had fallen had torn their consciousness and left them like two impersonal forces, there in contact.
他们站在一边，一副健忘的样子。两人似乎都愣住了，一动不动，几乎没有意识。他们陷入的小冲突撕裂了他们的意识，让他们像两股非个人力量一样相互接触。

He became aware of the lapse. He wanted to say something, to get on to a new more ordinary footing.
他意识到了这一失误。他想说点什么，以重新开始一个更加普通的生活。

‘You know,’ he said, ‘that I am having rooms here at the mill? Don’t you think we can have some good times?’
“你知道，”他说，“我在工厂有房间吗？你不认为我们可以度过一些美好时光吗？

‘Oh are you?’ she said, ignoring all his implication of admitted intimacy.
“哦，你是吗？”她说，无视他承认亲密的所有暗示。

He adjusted himself at once, became normally distant.
他立即调整自己，变得平常的疏远。

‘If I find I can live sufficiently by myself,’ he continued, ‘I shall give up my work altogether. It has become dead to me. I don’t believe in the humanity I pretend to be part of, I don’t care a straw for the social ideals I live by, I hate the dying organic form of social mankind—so it can’t be anything but trumpery, to work at education. I shall drop it as soon as I am clear enough—tomorrow perhaps—and be by myself.’
“如果我发现我可以靠自己过足够的生活，”他继续说道，“我就会完全放弃我的工作。”它对我来说已经死了。我不相信我假装属于其中的人性，我对我赖以生存的社会理想一点也不关心，我讨厌社会人类垂死的有机形式——所以这只能是胡言乱语，从事教育工作。一旦我足够清楚——也许明天——我就会放下它，独自一人。

‘Have you enough to live on?’ asked Ursula.
“你的生活费够吗？”乌苏拉问道。

‘Yes—I’ve about four hundred a year. That makes it easy for me.’
“是的——我一年大约有四百个。”这对我来说很容易。

There was a pause.
一阵停顿。

‘And what about Hermione?’ asked Ursula.
“那么赫敏呢？”乌苏拉问道。

‘That’s over, finally—a pure failure, and never could have been anything else.’
“一切终于结束了——纯粹的失败，不可能是其他任何事情。”

‘But you still know each other?’
“但是你们还认识吗？”

‘We could hardly pretend to be strangers, could we?’
“我们很难假装是陌生人，不是吗？”

There was a stubborn pause.
一阵顽固的停顿。

‘But isn’t that a half-measure?’ asked Ursula at length.
“但这不是一个折衷的办法吗？”乌苏拉最后问道。

‘I don’t think so,’ he said. ‘You’ll be able to tell me if it is.’
“我不这么认为，”他说。 “如果是的话，你可以告诉我。”

Again there was a pause of some minutes’ duration. He was thinking.
又出现了几分钟的停顿。他在想。

‘One must throw everything away, everything—let everything go, to get the one last thing one wants,’ he said.
“一个人必须扔掉一切，一切——放手一切，才能得到一个人最后想要的东西，”他说。

‘What thing?’ she asked in challenge.
“什么东西？”她挑战地问道。

‘I don’t know—freedom together,’ he said.
“我不知道——自由在一起，”他说。

She had wanted him to say ‘love.’
她想让他说“爱”。

There was heard a loud barking of the dogs below. He seemed disturbed by it. She did not notice. Only she thought he seemed uneasy.
听见下面传来狗的大声吠叫。他似乎对此感到不安。她没有注意到。只是她觉得他看起来很不安。

‘As a matter of fact,’ he said, in rather a small voice, ‘I believe that is Hermione come now, with Gerald Crich. She wanted to see the rooms before they are furnished.’
“事实上，”他用很小的声音说道，“我相信现在是赫敏和杰拉尔德·克里奇一起来的。”她想在房间布置好之前先看看房间。”

‘I know,’ said Ursula. ‘She will superintend the furnishing for you.’
“我知道，”乌苏拉说。 “她会为你监督家具的布置。”

‘Probably. Does it matter?’
'大概。有关系吗？'

‘Oh no, I should think not,’ said Ursula. ‘Though personally, I can’t bear her. I think she is a lie, if you like, you who are always talking about lies.’ Then she ruminated for a moment, when she broke out: ‘Yes, and I do mind if she furnishes your rooms—I do mind. I mind that you keep her hanging on at all.’
“哦，不，我想不会，”乌苏拉说。 “虽然就我个人而言，我无法忍受她。我认为她是一个谎言，如果你愿意的话，你这个总是在谈论谎言的人。”然后她沉思了一会儿，突然爆发：“是的，我确实介意她是否为你提供房间——我介意。我介意你让她坚持下去。

He was silent now, frowning.
他现在沉默了，皱着眉头。

‘Perhaps,’ he said. ‘I don’t WANT her to furnish the rooms here—and I don’t keep her hanging on. Only, I needn’t be churlish to her, need I? At any rate, I shall have to go down and see them now. You’ll come, won’t you?’
“也许吧，”他说。 “我不想让她布置这里的房间——而且我也不会让她坚持下去。只是，我没必要对她无礼，不是吗？无论如何，我现在必须下去看看他们了。你会来的，不是吗？

‘I don’t think so,’ she said coldly and irresolutely.
“我不这么认为，”她冷冷而犹豫地说。

‘Won’t you? Yes do. Come and see the rooms as well. Do come.’
‘你不会吗？是的。也来看看房间吧。来吧。

CHAPTER XII
第十二章

CARPETING
地毯

He set off down the bank, and she went unwillingly with him. Yet she would not have stayed away, either.
他沿着河岸出发，她不情愿地跟着他走。但她也不会离开。

‘We know each other well, you and I, already,’ he said. She did not answer.
“你和我，我们已经很了解了，”他说。她没有回答。

In the large darkish kitchen of the mill, the labourer’s wife was talking shrilly to Hermione and Gerald, who stood, he in white and she in a glistening bluish foulard, strangely luminous in the dusk of the room; whilst from the cages on the walls, a dozen or more canaries sang at the top of their voices. The cages were all placed round a small square window at the back, where the sunshine came in, a beautiful beam, filtering through green leaves of a tree. The voice of Mrs Salmon shrilled against the noise of the birds, which rose ever more wild and triumphant, and the woman’s voice went up and up against them, and the birds replied with wild animation.
在磨坊漆黑的大厨房里，工人的妻子正尖声对赫敏和杰拉尔德说话，他们站着，他穿着白色的衣服，她穿着一条闪闪发光的蓝色围巾，在房间的暮色中显得异常明亮。墙上的笼子里，有十几只金丝雀放声歌唱。笼子都围着后面的一个小方窗，阳光从那里照进来，一道美丽的光束，透过一棵树的绿叶。萨尔蒙夫人的声音在鸟儿的喧闹声中显得尖锐，鸟儿的叫声变得越来越狂野和得意，而女人的声音也越来越高，鸟儿们也以狂野的活力回应。

‘Here’s Rupert!’ shouted Gerald in the midst of the din. He was suffering badly, being very sensitive in the ear.
“鲁珀特来了！”杰拉尔德在喧闹声中喊道。他的耳朵非常敏感，非常痛苦。

‘O-o-h them birds, they won’t let you speak—!’ shrilled the labourer’s wife in disgust. ‘I’ll cover them up.’
“哦，哦，这些鸟儿，他们不让你说话——！”工人的妻子厌恶地尖叫道。 “我会把它们盖起来。”

And she darted here and there, throwing a duster, an apron, a towel, a table-cloth over the cages of the birds.
她到处跑，把掸子、围裙、毛巾、桌布扔到鸟笼上。

‘Now will you stop it, and let a body speak for your row,’ she said, still in a voice that was too high.
“现在你可以停下来，让一个人为你的争吵说话，”她说，声音仍然太高了。

The party watched her. Soon the cages were covered, they had a strange funereal look. But from under the towels odd defiant trills and bubblings still shook out.
众人注视着她。很快，笼子就盖好了，有一种奇怪的丧礼的样子。但毛巾下面仍然传来奇怪的、挑衅的颤音和冒泡声。

‘Oh, they won’t go on,’ said Mrs Salmon reassuringly. ‘They’ll go to sleep now.’
“哦，他们不会再继续下去了，”萨蒙夫人安慰道。 “他们现在要去睡觉了。”

‘Really,’ said Hermione, politely.
“真的，”赫敏礼貌地说。

‘They will,’ said Gerald. ‘They will go to sleep automatically, now the impression of evening is produced.’
“他们会的，”杰拉尔德说。 “他们会自动入睡，现在已经产生了晚上的印象。”

‘Are they so easily deceived?’ cried Ursula.
“他们这么容易受骗吗？”乌苏拉喊道。

‘Oh, yes,’ replied Gerald. ‘Don’t you know the story of Fabre, who, when he was a boy, put a hen’s head under her wing, and she straight away went to sleep? It’s quite true.’
“哦，是的，”杰拉德回答道。 “你难道不知道法布尔的故事吗？法布尔小时候，把一只母鸡的头放在她的翅膀下，她立刻就睡着了？这是千真万确的。

‘And did that make him a naturalist?’ asked Birkin.
“这是否使他成为一名博物学家？”伯金问道。

‘Probably,’ said Gerald.
“可能吧，”杰拉尔德说。

Meanwhile Ursula was peeping under one of the cloths. There sat the canary in a corner, bunched and fluffed up for sleep.
与此同时，乌苏拉正在一块布下偷看。金丝雀坐在角落里，蜷缩成一团，蓬松地睡觉。

‘How ridiculous!’ she cried. ‘It really thinks the night has come! How absurd! Really, how can one have any respect for a creature that is so easily taken in!’
“太可笑了！”她喊道。 ‘它真的认为夜晚已经来临了！多么荒唐啊！真是的，一个如此容易上当的生物，怎么可能有任何尊重呢！

‘Yes,’ sang Hermione, coming also to look. She put her hand on Ursula’s arm and chuckled a low laugh. ‘Yes, doesn’t he look comical?’ she chuckled. ‘Like a stupid husband.’
“是的，”赫敏唱道，也过来看看。她把手放在乌苏拉的手臂上，低声笑了起来。 “是的，他看起来不是很滑稽吗？”她笑着说。 “像个愚蠢的丈夫。”

Then, with her hand still on Ursula’s arm, she drew her away, saying, in her mild sing-song:
然后，她的手仍然放在乌苏拉的手臂上，将她拉开，用她温和的歌声说道：

‘How did you come here? We saw Gudrun too.’
‘你怎么到这里来了？我们也看到了古德伦。

‘I came to look at the pond,’ said Ursula, ‘and I found Mr Birkin there.’
“我是来看池塘的，”乌苏拉说，“我在那里找到了伯金先生。”

‘Did you? This is quite a Brangwen land, isn’t it!’
'你是否？这完全是布兰文的土地，不是吗！”

‘I’m afraid I hoped so,’ said Ursula. ‘I ran here for refuge, when I saw you down the lake, just putting off.’
“恐怕我也希望如此，”乌苏拉说。 “当我看到你在湖边时，我跑到这里避难。”

‘Did you! And now we’ve run you to earth.’
'你是否！现在我们已经把你带到地球了。

Hermione’s eyelids lifted with an uncanny movement, amused but overwrought. She had always her strange, rapt look, unnatural and irresponsible.
赫敏的眼皮抬起来，做出一种不可思议的动作，她觉得很有趣，但又有些紧张。她总是一副奇怪、全神贯注的样子，不自然、不负责任。

‘I was going on,’ said Ursula. ‘Mr Birkin wanted me to see the rooms. Isn’t it delightful to live here? It is perfect.’
“我正在继续，”乌苏拉说。 “伯金先生想让我参观房间。生活在这里不是很愉快吗？这十分完美。'

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, abstractedly. Then she turned right away from Ursula, ceased to know her existence.
“是的，”赫敏心不在焉地说。然后她转身离开乌苏拉，不再知道她的存在。

‘How do you feel, Rupert?’ she sang in a new, affectionate tone, to Birkin.
“你感觉怎么样，鲁珀特？”她用一种新的、深情的语气对伯金唱道。

‘Very well,’ he replied.
“很好，”他回答道。

‘Were you quite comfortable?’ The curious, sinister, rapt look was on Hermione’s face, she shrugged her bosom in a convulsed movement, and seemed like one half in a trance.
“你感觉很舒服吗？”赫敏脸上露出好奇、险恶、全神贯注的神情，她耸耸肩，抽搐着，看上去像是处于恍惚状态。

‘Quite comfortable,’ he replied.
“很舒服，”他回答道。

There was a long pause, whilst Hermione looked at him for a long time, from under her heavy, drugged eyelids.
停顿了很长一段时间，赫敏从她那沉重、涂了药的眼皮下看了他很长一段时间。

‘And you think you’ll be happy here?’ she said at last.
“你觉得你在这里会快乐吗？”她最后说道。

‘I’m sure I shall.’
“我确信我会的。”

‘I’m sure I shall do anything for him as I can,’ said the labourer’s wife. ‘And I’m sure our master will; so I HOPE he’ll find himself comfortable.’
“我确信我会尽我所能为他做任何事，”工人的妻子说。 “我相信我们的主人会的；所以我希望他会感到舒服。

Hermione turned and looked at her slowly.
赫敏转身慢慢地看着她。

‘Thank you so much,’ she said, and then she turned completely away again. She recovered her position, and lifting her face towards him, and addressing him exclusively, she said:
“非常感谢，”她说，然后又完全转过身去。她恢复了姿势，抬起脸对着他，专门对他说道：

‘Have you measured the rooms?’
“你测量过房间了吗？”

‘No,’ he said, ‘I’ve been mending the punt.’
“不，”他说，“我一直在修补这个赌注。”

‘Shall we do it now?’ she said slowly, balanced and dispassionate.
“我们现在就做吗？”她缓慢、平静、冷静地说。

‘Have you got a tape measure, Mrs Salmon?’ he said, turning to the woman.
“萨蒙夫人，你有卷尺吗？”他转向那个女人问道。

‘Yes sir, I think I can find one,’ replied the woman, bustling immediately to a basket. ‘This is the only one I’ve got, if it will do.’
“是的，先生，我想我能找到一个，”女人回答道，立即奔向一个篮子。 “如果可以的话，这是我唯一拥有的了。”

Hermione took it, though it was offered to him.
赫敏接过了它，尽管它是送给他的。

‘Thank you so much,’ she said. ‘It will do very nicely. Thank you so much.’ Then she turned to Birkin, saying with a little gay movement: ‘Shall we do it now, Rupert?’
“非常感谢，”她说。 ‘它会做得非常好。非常感谢你。”然后她转向伯金，动作有点快活地说：“我们现在就开始吧，鲁珀特？”

‘What about the others, they’ll be bored,’ he said reluctantly.
“那其他人呢，他们会很无聊的，”他不情愿地说。

‘Do you mind?’ said Hermione, turning to Ursula and Gerald vaguely.
“你介意吗？”赫敏茫然地转向乌苏拉和杰拉德问道。

‘Not in the least,’ they replied.
“一点也不，”他们回答道。

‘Which room shall we do first?’ she said, turning again to Birkin, with the same gaiety, now she was going to DO something with him.
“我们先去哪个房间？”她再次转向伯金，语气同样高兴，现在她要和他一起做点什么。

‘We’ll take them as they come,’ he said.
“他们来了我们就会接他们，”他说。

‘Should I be getting your teas ready, while you do that?’ said the labourer’s wife, also gay because SHE had something to do.
“你做这件事的时候，我应该给你准备茶吗？”工人的妻子说道，她也是同性恋，因为她有事要做。

‘Would you?’ said Hermione, turning to her with the curious motion of intimacy that seemed to envelop the woman, draw her almost to Hermione’s breast, and which left the others standing apart. ‘I should be so glad. Where shall we have it?’
“你愿意吗？”赫敏转向她，带着一种奇怪的亲密动作，这种动作似乎包围着这个女人，几乎把她拉到了赫敏的胸前，而这让其他人站开了。 ‘我应该很高兴。我们到哪里去得到它呢？

‘Where would you like it? Shall it be in here, or out on the grass?’
‘你想要哪里？它应该在这里，还是在外面的草地上？

‘Where shall we have tea?’ sang Hermione to the company at large.
“我们去哪里喝茶？”赫敏对着大家唱道。

‘On the bank by the pond. And WE’LL carry the things up, if you’ll just get them ready, Mrs Salmon,’ said Birkin.
‘在池塘边的岸边。如果你把东西准备好的话，我们会把东西搬上去的，萨蒙夫人，”伯金说。

‘All right,’ said the pleased woman.
“好吧，”女人高兴地说。

The party moved down the passage into the front room. It was empty, but clean and sunny. There was a window looking on to the tangled front garden.
一行人沿着通道来到前厅。那里空荡荡的，但很干净，阳光明媚。有一扇窗户可以看到杂乱的前花园。

‘This is the dining room,’ said Hermione. ‘We’ll measure it this way, Rupert—you go down there—‘
“这是餐厅，”赫敏说。 “我们会这样测量，鲁珀特——你下去——”

‘Can’t I do it for you,’ said Gerald, coming to take the end of the tape.
“我不能帮你做吗？”杰拉德说着，走过来拿走了磁带的一端。

‘No, thank you,’ cried Hermione, stooping to the ground in her bluish, brilliant foulard. It was a great joy to her to DO things, and to have the ordering of the job, with Birkin. He obeyed her subduedly. Ursula and Gerald looked on. It was a peculiarity of Hermione’s, that at every moment, she had one intimate, and turned all the rest of those present into onlookers. This raised her into a state of triumph.
“不，谢谢你，”赫敏喊道，她穿着那件蓝色的、亮丽的围巾弯腰坐在地上。与 Birkin 一起做事并接受工作安排对她来说是一种极大的乐趣。他乖乖地服从了她。乌苏拉和杰拉德在一旁看着。赫敏的一个特点是，她每时每刻都有一个亲密的人，而把在场的其他人都变成了旁观者。这使她进入一种胜利的状态。

They measured and discussed in the dining-room, and Hermione decided what the floor coverings must be. It sent her into a strange, convulsed anger, to be thwarted. Birkin always let her have her way, for the moment.
他们在餐厅里进行了测量和讨论，然后赫敏决定了地板覆盖物的材质。这让她产生了一种奇怪的、痉挛的愤怒，想要被挫败。柏金总是让她暂时随心所欲。

Then they moved across, through the hall, to the other front room, that was a little smaller than the first.
然后他们穿过大厅，来到另一间前厅，那间比第一个小一点。

‘This is the study,’ said Hermione. ‘Rupert, I have a rug that I want you to have for here. Will you let me give it to you? Do—I want to give it you.’
“这就是研究，”赫敏说。 “鲁珀特，我想给你一块地毯。”你能让我把它给你吗？做——我想给你。

‘What is it like?’ he asked ungraciously.
“那是什么样的？”他不客气地问道。

‘You haven’t seen it. It is chiefly rose red, then blue, a metallic, mid-blue, and a very soft dark blue. I think you would like it. Do you think you would?’
‘你还没看到。它主要是玫瑰红色，然后是蓝色、金属色、中蓝色和非常柔和的深蓝色。我想你会喜欢的。你认为你会吗？

‘It sounds very nice,’ he replied. ‘What is it? Oriental? With a pile?’
“听起来很好，”他回答道。 '它是什么？东方？有一堆？

‘Yes. Persian! It is made of camel’s hair, silky. I think it is called Bergamos—twelve feet by seven—. Do you think it will do?’
'是的。波斯语！它由骆驼毛制成，柔滑。我想它叫贝加莫斯——十二英尺乘七英尺——。你认为可以吗？

‘It would DO,’ he said. ‘But why should you give me an expensive rug? I can manage perfectly well with my old Oxford Turkish.’
“可以的，”他说。 “但是你为什么要给我一张昂贵的地毯呢？我可以很好地处理我的旧牛津土耳其语。

‘But may I give it to you? Do let me.’
‘但是我可以给你吗？让我来吧。

‘How much did it cost?’
'它多少钱？'

She looked at him, and said:
她看着他，说道：

‘I don’t remember. It was quite cheap.’
” “我不记得了。相当便宜。

He looked at her, his face set.
他看着她，脸色铁青。

‘I don’t want to take it, Hermione,’ he said.
“我不想接受它，赫敏，”他说。

‘Do let me give it to the rooms,’ she said, going up to him and putting her hand on his arm lightly, pleadingly. ‘I shall be so disappointed.’
“请让我把它交给房间，”她说道，走到他面前，轻轻地将手放在他的手臂上，恳求道。 “我会很失望的。”

‘You know I don’t want you to give me things,’ he repeated helplessly.
“你知道我不想让你给我东西，”他无助地重复道。

‘I don’t want to give you THINGS,’ she said teasingly. ‘But will you have this?’
“我不想给你东西，”她戏弄地说。 “但是你想要这个吗？”

‘All right,’ he said, defeated, and she triumphed.
“好吧，”他失败了，而她胜利了。

They went upstairs. There were two bedrooms to correspond with the rooms downstairs. One of them was half furnished, and Birkin had evidently slept there. Hermione went round the room carefully, taking in every detail, as if absorbing the evidence of his presence, in all the inanimate things. She felt the bed and examined the coverings.
他们上楼了。有两间卧室与楼下的房间相对应。其中一间还没有布置好，伯金显然就睡在那里。赫敏小心翼翼地绕着房间走一圈，仔细观察每一个细节，仿佛在吸收所有无生命事物中他存在的证据。她摸了摸床，检查了被子。

‘Are you SURE you were quite comfortable?’ she said, pressing the pillow.
“你确定你很舒服吗？”她按着枕头说道。

‘Perfectly,’ he replied coldly.
“完美。”他冷冷地回答。

‘And were you warm? There is no down quilt. I am sure you need one. You mustn’t have a great pressure of clothes.’
‘你暖和吗？没有羽绒被。我确信您需要一个。你一定不要对衣服有太大的压力。

‘I’ve got one,’ he said. ‘It is coming down.’
“我有一个，”他说。 “它正在下降。”

They measured the rooms, and lingered over every consideration. Ursula stood at the window and watched the woman carrying the tea up the bank to the pond. She hated the palaver Hermione made, she wanted to drink tea, she wanted anything but this fuss and business.
他们测量了房间，仔细考虑了每一个考虑因素。乌苏拉站在窗边，看着那个女人把茶端到岸边的池塘边。她讨厌赫敏的闲聊，她想喝茶，她什么都想要，除了这些大惊小怪和生意。

At last they all mounted the grassy bank, to the picnic. Hermione poured out tea. She ignored now Ursula’s presence. And Ursula, recovering from her ill-humour, turned to Gerald saying:
最后，他们都登上了绿草如茵的河岸，去野餐。赫敏倒了茶。她现在忽略了乌苏拉的存在。乌苏拉从坏脾气中恢复过来，转向杰拉尔德说：

‘Oh, I hated you so much the other day, Mr Crich,’
“哦，那天我非常恨你，克里奇先生，”

‘What for?’ said Gerald, wincing slightly away.
“为什么？”杰拉尔德问道，微微皱起眉头。

‘For treating your horse so badly. Oh, I hated you so much!’
‘对你的马如此恶劣。哦，我非常恨你！

‘What did he do?’ sang Hermione.
“他做了什么？”赫敏唱道。

‘He made his lovely sensitive Arab horse stand with him at the railway-crossing whilst a horrible lot of trucks went by; and the poor thing, she was in a perfect frenzy, a perfect agony. It was the most horrible sight you can imagine.’
“他让他那匹可爱而敏感的阿拉伯马和他一起站在铁路道口，而大量卡车经过；而这个可怜的女人，她正处于极度的疯狂、极度的痛苦之中。这是你能想象到的最可怕的景象。

‘Why did you do it, Gerald?’ asked Hermione, calm and interrogative.
“杰拉尔德，你为什么这么做？”赫敏平静而疑惑地问道。

‘She must learn to stand—what use is she to me in this country, if she shies and goes off every time an engine whistles.’
“她必须学会站立——如果她在每次引擎鸣笛时都躲起来并走开，那么她对这个国家的我有什么用处。”

‘But why inflict unnecessary torture?’ said Ursula. ‘Why make her stand all that time at the crossing? You might just as well have ridden back up the road, and saved all that horror. Her sides were bleeding where you had spurred her. It was too horrible—!’
“但是为什么要施加不必要的折磨呢？”乌苏拉说。 “为什么让她一直站在十字路口？你还不如骑回原路，避免所有的恐惧。她的两侧被你刺激的地方正在流血。太可怕了——！’

Gerald stiffened.
杰拉尔德僵住了。

‘I have to use her,’ he replied. ‘And if I’m going to be sure of her at ALL, she’ll have to learn to stand noises.’
“我必须利用她，”他回答道。 “如果我要完全信任她，她就必须学会忍受噪音。”

‘Why should she?’ cried Ursula in a passion. ‘She is a living creature, why should she stand anything, just because you choose to make her? She has as much right to her own being, as you have to yours.’
“她为什么要这么做？”乌苏拉激动地喊道。 ‘她是一个活物，为什么要因为你选择让她承受一切？她对自己的存在拥有同样的权利，就像你对自己的存在拥有同样的权利一样。

‘There I disagree,’ said Gerald. ‘I consider that mare is there for my use. Not because I bought her, but because that is the natural order. It is more natural for a man to take a horse and use it as he likes, than for him to go down on his knees to it, begging it to do as it wishes, and to fulfil its own marvellous nature.’
“我不同意，”杰拉尔德说。 “我认为那匹母马是为我所用的。不是因为我买了她，而是因为这是自然的秩序。对于一个人来说，驾驭一匹马并随心所欲地使用它，比跪下乞求它按照它的意愿行事，并实现其奇妙的本性更自然。

Ursula was just breaking out, when Hermione lifted her face and began, in her musing sing-song:
乌苏拉刚要爆发，赫敏抬起头，用她沉思的歌声开始说道：

‘I do think—I do really think we must have the COURAGE to use the lower animal life for our needs. I do think there is something wrong, when we look on every living creature as if it were ourselves. I do feel, that it is false to project our own feelings on every animate creature. It is a lack of discrimination, a lack of criticism.’
“我确实认为——我确实认为我们必须有勇气利用低等动物的生命来满足我们的需要。我确实认为，当我们把每一个生物视为我们自己时，就有些不对劲了。我确实觉得，将我们自己的感情投射到每一个有生命的生物上是错误的。这是缺乏歧视，缺乏批评。

‘Quite,’ said Birkin sharply. ‘Nothing is so detestable as the maudlin attributing of human feelings and consciousness to animals.’
“确实如此，”伯金尖锐地说。 “没有什么比伤感地把人类的感情和意识归咎于动物更令人憎恶的了。”

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, wearily, ‘we must really take a position. Either we are going to use the animals, or they will use us.’
“是的，”赫敏疲倦地说，“我们必须真正表明立场。要么我们利用动物，要么它们利用我们。”

‘That’s a fact,’ said Gerald. ‘A horse has got a will like a man, though it has no MIND strictly. And if your will isn’t master, then the horse is master of you. And this is a thing I can’t help. I can’t help being master of the horse.’
“这是事实，”杰拉尔德说。 ‘马像人一样有意志，尽管严格来说它没有头脑。如果你的意志不是主人，那么马就是你的主人。而这是我无能为力的事情。我情不自禁地成为了这匹马的主人。

‘If only we could learn how to use our will,’ said Hermione, ‘we could do anything. The will can cure anything, and put anything right. That I am convinced of—if only we use the will properly, intelligibly.’
“只要我们能学会如何运用我们的意志，”赫敏说，“我们就能做任何事。”意志可以治愈一切，纠正一切。我对此深信不疑——只要我们正确、清晰地运用意志即可。

‘What do you mean by using the will properly?’ said Birkin.
“正确使用意志是什么意思？”伯金说。

‘A very great doctor taught me,’ she said, addressing Ursula and Gerald vaguely. ‘He told me for instance, that to cure oneself of a bad habit, one should FORCE oneself to do it, when one would not do it—make oneself do it—and then the habit would disappear.’
“一位非常伟大的医生教了我，”她含糊地对乌苏拉和杰拉德说道。 “例如，他告诉我，要治愈自己的一个坏习惯，一个人应该强迫自己去做，当一个人不愿意做时——强迫自己去做——然后这个习惯就会消失。”

‘How do you mean?’ said Gerald.
“你是什么意思？”杰拉尔德说。

‘If you bite your nails, for example. Then, when you don’t want to bite your nails, bite them, make yourself bite them. And you would find the habit was broken.’
“例如，如果你咬指甲。然后，当你不想咬指甲时，就咬指甲，让自己咬指甲。你会发现这个习惯被打破了。

‘Is that so?’ said Gerald.
“是这样吗？”杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes. And in so many things, I have MADE myself well. I was a very queer and nervous girl. And by learning to use my will, simply by using my will, I MADE myself right.’
'是的。在很多事情上，我都让自己变得很好。我是一个非常奇怪和紧张的女孩。通过学习运用我的意志，仅仅通过运用我的意志，我就让自己变得正确。

Ursula looked all the white at Hermione, as she spoke in her slow, dispassionate, and yet strangely tense voice. A curious thrill went over the younger woman. Some strange, dark, convulsive power was in Hermione, fascinating and repelling.
乌苏拉脸色惨白地看着赫敏，她的声音缓慢、冷静，但又奇怪地紧张。年轻女子感到一种奇怪的兴奋。赫敏身上有一种奇怪的、黑暗的、痉挛的力量，既令人着迷又令人厌恶。

‘It is fatal to use the will like that,’ cried Birkin harshly, ‘disgusting. Such a will is an obscenity.’
“这样使用意志是致命的，”伯金严厉地叫道，“令人作呕。”这样的遗嘱是一种猥亵行为。

Hermione looked at him for a long time, with her shadowed, heavy eyes. Her face was soft and pale and thin, almost phosphorescent, her jaw was lean.
赫敏用她那双阴沉的、沉重的眼睛看着他良久。她的脸柔和、苍白、瘦削，几乎泛着磷光，下巴瘦削。

‘I’m sure it isn’t,’ she said at length. There always seemed an interval, a strange split between what she seemed to feel and experience, and what she actually said and thought. She seemed to catch her thoughts at length from off the surface of a maelstrom of chaotic black emotions and reactions, and Birkin was always filled with repulsion, she caught so infallibly, her will never failed her. Her voice was always dispassionate and tense, and perfectly confident. Yet she shuddered with a sense of nausea, a sort of seasickness that always threatened to overwhelm her mind. But her mind remained unbroken, her will was still perfect. It almost sent Birkin mad. But he would never, never dare to break her will, and let loose the maelstrom of her subconsciousness, and see her in her ultimate madness. Yet he was always striking at her.
“我确信不是，”她最后说道。她似乎感觉到和经历的事情与她实际所说和想到的事情之间似乎总是存在着一段间隔，一种奇怪的分裂。她似乎从混乱的黑色情绪和反应的漩涡表面终于捕捉到了自己的想法，而伯金总是充满排斥，她捕捉得如此准确，她的意志永远不会辜负她。她的声音总是冷静而紧张，却充满了自信。然而，她却因一种恶心的感觉而颤抖，这种晕船的感觉总是威胁着她的大脑。但她的心志依然完好，她的意志依然完美。这几乎让伯金发疯了。但他绝对、绝对不敢违背她的意志，释放她潜意识的漩涡，看到她最终的疯狂。但他却总是对她发起攻击。

‘And of course,’ he said to Gerald, ‘horses HAVEN’T got a complete will, like human beings. A horse has no ONE will. Every horse, strictly, has two wills. With one will, it wants to put itself in the human power completely—and with the other, it wants to be free, wild. The two wills sometimes lock—you know that, if ever you’ve felt a horse bolt, while you’ve been driving it.’
“当然，”他对杰拉尔德说，“马不像人类一样有完整的意志。”一匹马没有单一的意志。严格来说，每匹马都有两个意志。就一个意志而言，它想要将自己完全置于人类的力量之下，而就另一个意志而言，它想要自由、狂野。这两个意志有时会锁在一起——你知道，如果你在开车的时候感觉到马的螺栓。

‘I have felt a horse bolt while I was driving it,’ said Gerald, ‘but it didn’t make me know it had two wills. I only knew it was frightened.’
杰拉尔德说：“我在驾驶马车时感觉到了马蹄声，但它并没有让我知道它有两个意志。”我只知道它很害怕。

Hermione had ceased to listen. She simply became oblivious when these subjects were started.
赫敏已经不再听了。当这些话题开始时，她只是忘记了。

‘Why should a horse want to put itself in the human power?’ asked Ursula. ‘That is quite incomprehensible to me. I don’t believe it ever wanted it.’
“为什么一匹马想要将自己置于人类的力量之下？”乌苏拉问道。 ‘这对我来说实在是难以理解。我不相信它曾经想要它。

‘Yes it did. It’s the last, perhaps highest, love-impulse: resign your will to the higher being,’ said Birkin.
'是的，它确实。这是最后的，也许是最高的爱的冲动：将你的意志屈服于更高的存在，”伯金说。

‘What curious notions you have of love,’ jeered Ursula.
“你对爱情有多么奇怪的想法啊，”乌苏拉嘲笑道。

‘And woman is the same as horses: two wills act in opposition inside her. With one will, she wants to subject herself utterly. With the other she wants to bolt, and pitch her rider to perdition.’
‘而女人就和马一样：她体内有两种相互对立的意志。她一心想要将自己完全臣服。她想和另一只一起逃跑，让她的骑手陷入灭亡。

‘Then I’m a bolter,’ said Ursula, with a burst of laughter.
“那我就是一名爆弹手了，”乌苏拉突然大笑起来。

‘It’s a dangerous thing to domesticate even horses, let alone women,’ said Birkin. ‘The dominant principle has some rare antagonists.’
伯金说：“即使是驯养马也是一件危险的事情，更不用说驯养女人了。” “主导原则有一些罕见的对手。”

‘Good thing too,’ said Ursula.
“这也是好事，”乌苏拉说。

‘Quite,’ said Gerald, with a faint smile. ‘There’s more fun.’
“确实如此，”杰拉尔德微笑着说道。 “还有更多乐趣。”

Hermione could bear no more. She rose, saying in her easy sing-song:
赫敏再也无法忍受了。她站起来，用轻松的歌声说道：

‘Isn’t the evening beautiful! I get filled sometimes with such a great sense of beauty, that I feel I can hardly bear it.’
‘这个夜晚不是很美吗！有时我会被一种强烈的美感所充满，以至于我觉得自己几乎无法承受。

Ursula, to whom she had appealed, rose with her, moved to the last impersonal depths. And Birkin seemed to her almost a monster of hateful arrogance. She went with Hermione along the bank of the pond, talking of beautiful, soothing things, picking the gentle cowslips.
乌苏拉，她所呼吁的人，与她一起站了起来，走向了最后的非个人深处。在她看来，柏金几乎是一个可恨的傲慢怪物。她和赫敏一起沿着池塘边走，谈论美丽、舒缓的事物，采摘温柔的黄花九轮草。

‘Wouldn’t you like a dress,’ said Ursula to Hermione, ‘of this yellow spotted with orange—a cotton dress?’
“你不想买一件裙子吗？”乌苏拉对赫敏说，“这条黄色、橙色斑点的棉质连衣裙？”

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, stopping and looking at the flower, letting the thought come home to her and soothe her. ‘Wouldn’t it be pretty? I should LOVE it.’
“是的，”赫敏说，停下来看着那朵花，让这个想法浮现在脑海中，让她平静下来。 ‘这不是很漂亮吗？我应该喜欢它。

And she turned smiling to Ursula, in a feeling of real affection.
她转身对乌苏拉微笑，带着一种真正的爱意。

But Gerald remained with Birkin, wanting to probe him to the bottom, to know what he meant by the dual will in horses. A flicker of excitement danced on Gerald’s face.
但杰拉尔德仍然留在伯金身边，想探究他的底细，了解他所说的马的双重意志是什么意思。杰拉德的脸上闪过一丝兴奋。

Hermione and Ursula strayed on together, united in a sudden bond of deep affection and closeness.
赫敏和乌苏拉一起漫步，突然之间产生了深厚的感情和亲密的联系。

‘I really do not want to be forced into all this criticism and analysis of life. I really DO want to see things in their entirety, with their beauty left to them, and their wholeness, their natural holiness. Don’t you feel it, don’t you feel you CAN’T be tortured into any more knowledge?’ said Hermione, stopping in front of Ursula, and turning to her with clenched fists thrust downwards.
“我真的不想被迫对生活进行所有这些批评和分析。我真的很想看到事物的整体，看到它们的美丽、它们的完整性、它们自然的圣洁。你不觉得吗？你不觉得你不能再被折磨得更多知识了吗？”赫敏在乌苏拉面前停了下来，转向她，握紧了拳头向下推。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula. ‘I do. I am sick of all this poking and prying.’
“是的，”乌苏拉说。 '我愿意。我厌倦了所有这些刺探和窥探。

‘I’m so glad you are. Sometimes,’ said Hermione, again stopping arrested in her progress and turning to Ursula, ‘sometimes I wonder if I OUGHT to submit to all this realisation, if I am not being weak in rejecting it. But I feel I CAN’T—I CAN’T. It seems to destroy EVERYTHING. All the beauty and the—and the true holiness is destroyed—and I feel I can’t live without them.’
‘我很高兴你是这样。有时，”赫敏说道，再次停止了前进的脚步，转向乌苏拉，“有时我想知道我是否应该接受所有这些认识，如果我在拒绝它方面不是软弱的话。但我觉得我不能——我不能。它似乎摧毁了一切。所有的美丽和真正的神圣都被摧毁了，我觉得没有它们我就无法生活。

‘And it would be simply wrong to live without them,’ cried Ursula. ‘No, it is so IRREVERENT to think that everything must be realised in the head. Really, something must be left to the Lord, there always is and always will be.’
“没有它们，生活就是错误的，”乌苏拉喊道。 ‘不，认为一切都必须在头脑中实现的想法是非常不敬的。确实，有些东西必须留给主，永远存在，也永远存在。”

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, reassured like a child, ‘it should, shouldn’t it? And Rupert—‘ she lifted her face to the sky, in a muse—‘he CAN only tear things to pieces. He really IS like a boy who must pull everything to pieces to see how it is made. And I can’t think it is right—it does seem so irreverent, as you say.’
“是的，”赫敏像个孩子一样放心地说，“应该这样，不是吗？而鲁珀特——”她将脸仰向天空，沉思着——“他只能把东西撕成碎片。他真的就像一个男孩，必须把所有东西都拆散才能看看它是如何制成的。我不认为这是正确的——正如你所说，这确实看起来很不敬。”

‘Like tearing open a bud to see what the flower will be like,’ said Ursula.
“就像撕开花蕾看看花会是什么样子一样，”乌苏拉说。

‘Yes. And that kills everything, doesn’t it? It doesn’t allow any possibility of flowering.’
'是的。这会杀死一切，不是吗？它不允许任何开花的可能性。

‘Of course not,’ said Ursula. ‘It is purely destructive.’
“当然不是，”乌苏拉说。 “这纯粹是破坏性的。”

‘It is, isn’t it!’
“是啊，不是吗！”

Hermione looked long and slow at Ursula, seeming to accept confirmation from her. Then the two women were silent. As soon as they were in accord, they began mutually to mistrust each other. In spite of herself, Ursula felt herself recoiling from Hermione. It was all she could do to restrain her revulsion.
赫敏缓慢地看着乌苏拉，似乎接受了她的确认。然后两女都沉默了。一旦意见一致，他们就开始互相不信任。乌苏拉不由自主地感到自己在躲避赫敏。她所能做的就是克制自己的厌恶。

They returned to the men, like two conspirators who have withdrawn to come to an agreement. Birkin looked up at them. Ursula hated him for his cold watchfulness. But he said nothing.
他们回到了男人身边，就像两个撤退达成协议的阴谋家。伯金抬头看着他们。乌苏拉讨厌他的冷漠警惕。但他什么也没说。

‘Shall we be going?’ said Hermione. ‘Rupert, you are coming to Shortlands to dinner? Will you come at once, will you come now, with us?’
“我们要走了吗？”赫敏说。 “鲁珀特，你要来肖特兰吃晚饭吗？你能马上来吗？现在就和我们一起来吗？

‘I’m not dressed,’ replied Birkin. ‘And you know Gerald stickles for convention.’
“我没穿衣服，”伯金回答道。 “你也知道杰拉尔德·斯蒂克斯很注重惯例。”

‘I don’t stickle for it,’ said Gerald. ‘But if you’d got as sick as I have of rowdy go-as-you-please in the house, you’d prefer it if people were peaceful and conventional, at least at meals.’
“我不会坚持下去，”杰拉尔德说。 “但如果你像我一样讨厌在家里随心所欲地吵闹，那么你会更喜欢人们安静而传统，至少在吃饭时是这样。”

‘All right,’ said Birkin.
“好吧，”伯金说。

‘But can’t we wait for you while you dress?’ persisted Hermione.
“但是我们不能在你穿衣服的时候等你吗？”赫敏坚持道。

‘If you like.’
'如果你喜欢。'

He rose to go indoors. Ursula said she would take her leave.
他起身要进屋。乌苏拉说她要告辞了。

‘Only,’ she said, turning to Gerald, ‘I must say that, however man is lord of the beast and the fowl, I still don’t think he has any right to violate the feelings of the inferior creation. I still think it would have been much more sensible and nice of you if you’d trotted back up the road while the train went by, and been considerate.’
“只是，”她转向杰拉尔德说道，“我必须说，无论人类是野兽和飞禽的统治者，我仍然认为他没有权利侵犯低等生物的感情。我仍然认为，如果你在火车经过时小跑回到路上，并且体贴一些，那会更明智、更友善。”

‘I see,’ said Gerald, smiling, but somewhat annoyed. ‘I must remember another time.’
“我明白了，”杰拉尔德微笑着说，但有些恼火。 “我必须记得下次。”

‘They all think I’m an interfering female,’ thought Ursula to herself, as she went away. But she was in arms against them.
“他们都认为我是个爱管闲事的女人。”乌苏拉走开时心里想。但她却武装起来反对他们。

She ran home plunged in thought. She had been very much moved by Hermione, she had really come into contact with her, so that there was a sort of league between the two women. And yet she could not bear her. But she put the thought away. ‘She’s really good,’ she said to herself. ‘She really wants what is right.’ And she tried to feel at one with Hermione, and to shut off from Birkin. She was strictly hostile to him. But she was held to him by some bond, some deep principle. This at once irritated her and saved her.
她跑回家，陷入沉思。她被赫敏深深打动了，她真正接触到了她，所以两个女人之间有一种联盟。但她还是无法忍受她。但她打消了这个念头。 “她真的很好，”她对自己说。 “她真的想要做正确的事。”她试图与赫敏融为一体，并与伯金断绝关系。她对他怀有严格的敌意。但她和他之间有某种纽带、某种深刻的原则。这立刻激怒了她，也拯救了她。

Only now and again, violent little shudders would come over her, out of her subconsciousness, and she knew it was the fact that she had stated her challenge to Birkin, and he had, consciously or unconsciously, accepted. It was a fight to the death between them—or to new life: though in what the conflict lay, no one could say.
只是时不时地，她的潜意识里会感到剧烈的颤抖，她知道她已经向伯金提出了挑战，而他也有意无意地接受了。这是他们之间的一场生死之战——或者是为了新的生命：尽管没有人能说出冲突的根源。

CHAPTER XIII
第十三章

MINO
米诺

The days went by, and she received no sign. Was he going to ignore her, was he going to take no further notice of her secret? A dreary weight of anxiety and acrid bitterness settled on her. And yet Ursula knew she was only deceiving herself, and that he would proceed. She said no word to anybody.
日子一天天过去，她却没有收到任何消息。难道他要无视她，不再留意她的秘密吗？一种沉闷的焦虑和辛辣的苦涩压在她的心头。然而乌苏拉知道她只是在欺骗自己，而他会继续下去。她没有对任何人说一句话。

Then, sure enough, there came a note from him, asking if she would come to tea with Gudrun, to his rooms in town.
然后，果然，他收到了一张纸条，询问她是否愿意去他在城里的房间里和古德伦一起喝茶。

‘Why does he ask Gudrun as well?’ she asked herself at once. ‘Does he want to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?’ She was tormented by the thought that he wanted to protect himself. But at the end of all, she only said to herself:
“为什么他也问古德伦？”她立刻问自己。 “他是想保护自己，还是认为我不会一个人去？”一想到他想保护自己，她就感到痛苦。但最终，她只对自己说：

‘I don’t want Gudrun to be there, because I want him to say something more to me. So I shan’t tell Gudrun anything about it, and I shall go alone. Then I shall know.’
“我不想让古德伦在那里，因为我想让他对我说更多的话。所以我不会告诉古珍任何事情，我会一个人去。然后我就知道了。

She found herself sitting on the tram-car, mounting up the hill going out of the town, to the place where he had his lodging. She seemed to have passed into a kind of dream world, absolved from the conditions of actuality. She watched the sordid streets of the town go by beneath her, as if she were a spirit disconnected from the material universe. What had it all to do with her? She was palpitating and formless within the flux of the ghost life. She could not consider any more, what anybody would say of her or think about her. People had passed out of her range, she was absolved. She had fallen strange and dim, out of the sheath of the material life, as a berry falls from the only world it has ever known, down out of the sheath on to the real unknown.
她发现自己正坐在电车上，爬上山坡，驶出小镇，前往他住的地方。她似乎进入了一种梦幻世界，摆脱了现实的束缚。她看着小镇肮脏的街道从她脚下驶过，仿佛她是一个与物质宇宙脱节的灵魂。这一切与她有什么关系？她在鬼魂生命的流动中心悸且无形。她无法再考虑别人会怎么说她或怎么想她。人们已经超出了她​​的范围，她就被赦免了。她从物质生活的外壳中奇怪而暗淡地坠落，就像一颗浆果从它所知道的唯一世界中掉下来，从外壳落到真正的未知世界中。

Birkin was standing in the middle of the room, when she was shown in by the landlady. He too was moved outside himself. She saw him agitated and shaken, a frail, unsubstantial body silent like the node of some violent force, that came out from him and shook her almost into a swoon.
当女房东带她进来时，伯金正站在房间中央。他也被转移到了自己之外。她看到他焦躁不安，虚弱无力的身体安静得像某种暴力力量的节点，从他身上散发出来，让她几乎昏厥。

‘You are alone?’ he said.
“你一个人吗？”他说。

‘Yes—Gudrun could not come.’
“是的——古德伦不能来。”

He instantly guessed why.
他立刻猜到了原因。

And they were both seated in silence, in the terrible tension of the room. She was aware that it was a pleasant room, full of light and very restful in its form—aware also of a fuchsia tree, with dangling scarlet and purple flowers.
他们两人都默默地坐着，房间里气氛极其紧张。她意识到这是一个令人愉快的房间，光线充足，而且非常宁静——她还注意到一棵紫红色的树，开着猩红色和紫色的花朵。

‘How nice the fuchsias are!’ she said, to break the silence.
“紫红色的花多漂亮啊！”她打破沉默说道。

‘Aren’t they! Did you think I had forgotten what I said?’
‘不是吗！你以为我忘了我说过的话吗？

A swoon went over Ursula’s mind.
乌苏拉心头一阵晕眩。

‘I don’t want you to remember it—if you don’t want to,’ she struggled to say, through the dark mist that covered her.
“我不想让你记住它——如果你不想的话，”她透过笼罩在她身上的黑雾艰难地说。

There was silence for some moments.
一阵沉默。

‘No,’ he said. ‘It isn’t that. Only—if we are going to know each other, we must pledge ourselves for ever. If we are going to make a relationship, even of friendship, there must be something final and infallible about it.’
“不，”他说。 ‘不是那样的。只是——如果我们要相识，我们就必须承诺永远。如果我们要建立一种关系，即使是友谊，也必须有某种最终的、绝对可靠的东西。”

There was a clang of mistrust and almost anger in his voice. She did not answer. Her heart was too much contracted. She could not have spoken.
他的声音里充满了不信任和几乎是愤怒。她没有回答。她的心太收缩了。她无法说话。

Seeing she was not going to reply, he continued, almost bitterly, giving himself away:
见她不肯回答，他几乎痛苦地继续说道：

‘I can’t say it is love I have to offer—and it isn’t love I want. It is something much more impersonal and harder—and rarer.’
“我不能说这是我必须提供的爱——而且这也不是我想要的爱。这是一种更非个人化、更困难、也更罕见的事情。

There was a silence, out of which she said:
一阵沉默，她说道：

‘You mean you don’t love me?’
“你的意思是你不爱我？”

She suffered furiously, saying that.
她痛苦地说道。

‘Yes, if you like to put it like that. Though perhaps that isn’t true. I don’t know. At any rate, I don’t feel the emotion of love for you—no, and I don’t want to. Because it gives out in the last issues.’
“是的，如果你愿意这么说的话。尽管这也许不是真的。我不知道。无论如何，我没有感受到对你的爱的情感——不，我也不想。因为它在最后几期中消失了。

‘Love gives out in the last issues?’ she asked, feeling numb to the lips.
“最后几期的爱情已经耗尽了？”她问道，感觉嘴唇麻木了。

‘Yes, it does. At the very last, one is alone, beyond the influence of love. There is a real impersonal me, that is beyond love, beyond any emotional relationship. So it is with you. But we want to delude ourselves that love is the root. It isn’t. It is only the branches. The root is beyond love, a naked kind of isolation, an isolated me, that does NOT meet and mingle, and never can.’
'是的，它确实。最后，一个人孤独一人，不受爱的影响。有一个真正的非个人的我，它超越了爱，超越了任何情感关系。你也是如此。但我们却想欺骗自己，认为爱是根源。事实并非如此。这只是树枝。根源超越了爱，一种赤裸裸的孤立，一个孤立的我，不能见面、交往，也永远不能。

She watched him with wide, troubled eyes. His face was incandescent in its abstract earnestness.
她睁大而困惑的眼睛看着他。他的脸因抽象的认真而炽热。

‘And you mean you can’t love?’ she asked, in trepidation.
“你的意思是你不能爱？”她惊恐地问道。

‘Yes, if you like. I have loved. But there is a beyond, where there is not love.’
‘是的，如果你愿意的话。我曾经爱过。但还有一个彼岸，那里没有爱。”

She could not submit to this. She felt it swooning over her. But she could not submit.
她不能屈服于此。她感到它让她着迷。但她不能屈服。

‘But how do you know—if you have never REALLY loved?’ she asked.
“但是你怎么知道——如果你从未真正爱过呢？”她问道。

‘It is true, what I say; there is a beyond, in you, in me, which is further than love, beyond the scope, as stars are beyond the scope of vision, some of them.’
“我说的是真的；在你、在我身上都有一种超越，它比爱更远，超出了范围，就像星星超出了视野的范围一样，其中一些。

‘Then there is no love,’ cried Ursula.
“那就没有爱了，”乌苏拉喊道。

‘Ultimately, no, there is something else. But, ultimately, there IS no love.’
‘最终，不，还有别的事情。但最终，没有爱。”

Ursula was given over to this statement for some moments. Then she half rose from her chair, saying, in a final, repellent voice:
乌苏拉有一段时间对这句话很感兴趣。然后她从椅子上半站起来，最后用令人厌恶的声音说道：

‘Then let me go home—what am I doing here?’
“那让我回家吧——我在这里做什么？”

‘There is the door,’ he said. ‘You are a free agent.’
“门在那儿，”他说。 “你是一名自由球员。”

He was suspended finely and perfectly in this extremity. She hung motionless for some seconds, then she sat down again.
他被完美地悬浮在这个末端。她一动不动地悬了几秒，然后又坐了下来。

‘If there is no love, what is there?’ she cried, almost jeering.
“如果没有爱，那还有什么？”她喊道，几乎是在嘲笑。

‘Something,’ he said, looking at her, battling with his soul, with all his might.
“有什么东西，”他看着她说道，用尽全力与自己的灵魂作斗争。

‘What?’
'什么？'

He was silent for a long time, unable to be in communication with her while she was in this state of opposition.
他沉默了许久，在她这种对立的状态下，无法与她沟通。

‘There is,’ he said, in a voice of pure abstraction; ‘a final me which is stark and impersonal and beyond responsibility. So there is a final you. And it is there I would want to meet you—not in the emotional, loving plane—but there beyond, where there is no speech and no terms of agreement. There we are two stark, unknown beings, two utterly strange creatures, I would want to approach you, and you me. And there could be no obligation, because there is no standard for action there, because no understanding has been reaped from that plane. It is quite inhuman,—so there can be no calling to book, in any form whatsoever—because one is outside the pale of all that is accepted, and nothing known applies. One can only follow the impulse, taking that which lies in front, and responsible for nothing, asked for nothing, giving nothing, only each taking according to the primal desire.’
“有，”他用一种纯粹抽象的声音说道。 “最终的我是赤裸裸的、客观的、超越责任的。”于是就有了最终的你。我想在那里见到你——不是在情感、爱的层面——而是在更远的地方，那里没有言语，也没有协议条款。我们是两个截然不同的未知生物，两个完全陌生的生物，我想接近你，而你我。而且不可能有任何义务，因为那里没有行动标准，因为没有从那个层面获得理解。这是非常不人道的，所以不可能有任何形式的书的召唤，因为一个人超出了所有被接受的范围，并且没有任何已知的适用。只能随波逐流，拿走眼前的东西，不负任何责任，不索取任何东西，不给予任何东西，只是各取各的本愿而已。

Ursula listened to this speech, her mind dumb and almost senseless, what he said was so unexpected and so untoward.
乌苏拉听着这番话，脑子一片空白，几乎失去了知觉，他说的话是那么的出人意料，又是那么的不妥。

‘It is just purely selfish,’ she said.
“这纯粹是自私的，”她说。

‘If it is pure, yes. But it isn’t selfish at all. Because I don’t KNOW what I want of you. I deliver MYSELF over to the unknown, in coming to you, I am without reserves or defences, stripped entirely, into the unknown. Only there needs the pledge between us, that we will both cast off everything, cast off ourselves even, and cease to be, so that that which is perfectly ourselves can take place in us.’
‘如果它是纯净的，是的。但这一点也不自私。因为我不知道我想要你什么。我把自己交给未知，在走向你的过程中，我毫无保留或防御，完全被剥夺，进入未知。只有我们之间需要发誓，我们都将抛弃一切，甚至抛弃我们自己，不再存在，这样，完美的我们自己才能在我们身上发生。

She pondered along her own line of thought.
她顺着自己的思路思考着。

‘But it is because you love me, that you want me?’ she persisted.
“但正是因为你爱我，你才想要我？”她坚持道。

‘No it isn’t. It is because I believe in you—if I DO believe in you.’
‘不，不是。这是因为我相信你——如果我确实相信你的话。

‘Aren’t you sure?’ she laughed, suddenly hurt.
“你不确定吗？”她笑道，突然很受伤。

He was looking at her steadfastly, scarcely heeding what she said.
他定定地看着她，根本不理会她的话。

‘Yes, I must believe in you, or else I shouldn’t be here saying this,’ he replied. ‘But that is all the proof I have. I don’t feel any very strong belief at this particular moment.’
“是的，我必须相信你，否则我不应该在这里说这些，”他回答道。 “但这就是我所拥有的全部证据。在这个特定的时刻，我没有感觉到任何非常强烈的信念。

She disliked him for this sudden relapse into weariness and faithlessness.
她不喜欢他突然陷入疲倦和不忠。

‘But don’t you think me good-looking?’ she persisted, in a mocking voice.
“但是你不觉得我好看吗？”她用嘲弄的声音继续问道。

He looked at her, to see if he felt that she was good-looking.
他看着她，想看看他是否觉得她好看。

‘I don’t FEEL that you’re good-looking,’ he said.
“我不觉得你好看，”他说。

‘Not even attractive?’ she mocked, bitingly.
“连吸引力都没有？”她尖刻地嘲笑道。

He knitted his brows in sudden exasperation.
他突然恼怒地皱起了眉头。

‘Don’t you see that it’s not a question of visual appreciation in the least,’ he cried. ‘I don’t WANT to see you. I’ve seen plenty of women, I’m sick and weary of seeing them. I want a woman I don’t see.’
“你难道没有看到这根本不是视觉欣赏的问题吗？”他喊道。 ‘我不想见你。我见过很多女人，我厌倦了见到她们。我想要一个我看不见的女人。

‘I’m sorry I can’t oblige you by being invisible,’ she laughed.
“很抱歉，我不能通过隐形来满足你的要求，”她笑着说。

‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you are invisible to me, if you don’t force me to be visually aware of you. But I don’t want to see you or hear you.’
“是的，”他说，“如果你不强迫我在视觉上意识到你，你对我来说是隐形的。”但我不想看到你或听到你的声音。

‘What did you ask me to tea for, then?’ she mocked.
“那你请我喝茶干什么？”她嘲笑道。

But he would take no notice of her. He was talking to himself.
但他不会理睬她。他在自言自语。

‘I want to find you, where you don’t know your own existence, the you that your common self denies utterly. But I don’t want your good looks, and I don’t want your womanly feelings, and I don’t want your thoughts nor opinions nor your ideas—they are all bagatelles to me.’
‘我想找到你，在你不知道自己存在的地方，那个你的共同自我完全否认的你。但我不想要你的美貌，我不想要你的女人味，我不想要你的想法、意见或想法——它们对我来说都是小事。

‘You are very conceited, Monsieur,’ she mocked. ‘How do you know what my womanly feelings are, or my thoughts or my ideas? You don’t even know what I think of you now.’
“你太自负了，先生，”她嘲笑道。 ‘你怎么知道我的女人味是什么，或者我的想法或我的想法？你甚至不知道我现在对你的看法。

‘Nor do I care in the slightest.’
“我一点也不在乎。”

‘I think you are very silly. I think you want to tell me you love me, and you go all this way round to do it.’
‘我觉得你很傻。我想你想告诉我你爱我，并且你千方百计做到了这一点。

‘All right,’ he said, looking up with sudden exasperation. ‘Now go away then, and leave me alone. I don’t want any more of your meretricious persiflage.’
“好吧，”他说，突然恼怒地抬起头。 ‘那么现在走开吧，别打扰我。我不想再听你的花哨的嘲讽了。

‘Is it really persiflage?’ she mocked, her face really relaxing into laughter. She interpreted it, that he had made a deep confession of love to her. But he was so absurd in his words, also.
“这真的是戏谑吗？”她嘲笑道，脸上真的笑出了声。她解读为，他向她深深地表白了爱意。但他的话也太荒谬了。

They were silent for many minutes, she was pleased and elated like a child. His concentration broke, he began to look at her simply and naturally.
他们沉默了好几分钟，她像个孩子一样高兴又高兴。他的注意力被打破了，他开始简单而自然地看着她。

‘What I want is a strange conjunction with you—‘ he said quietly; ‘not meeting and mingling—you are quite right—but an equilibrium, a pure balance of two single beings—as the stars balance each other.’
“我想要的是与你有一种奇怪的结合——”他轻声说道； “不是相遇和混合——你说得很对——而是一种平衡，两个个体的纯粹平衡——就像星星相互平衡一样。”

She looked at him. He was very earnest, and earnestness was always rather ridiculous, commonplace, to her. It made her feel unfree and uncomfortable. Yet she liked him so much. But why drag in the stars.
她看着他。他很认真，而认真对她来说却总是显得可笑、司空见惯。这让她感到不自由和不舒服。然而她却如此喜欢他。但为什么要把星星拖进去呢。

‘Isn’t this rather sudden?’ she mocked.
“这不是太突然了吗？”她嘲笑道。

He began to laugh.
他开始大笑。

‘Best to read the terms of the contract, before we sign,’ he said.
“在我们签字之前，最好先阅读合同条款，”他说。

A young grey cat that had been sleeping on the sofa jumped down and stretched, rising on its long legs, and arching its slim back. Then it sat considering for a moment, erect and kingly. And then, like a dart, it had shot out of the room, through the open window-doors, and into the garden.
一只睡在沙发上的小灰猫跳了下来，伸了个懒腰，长长的腿站了起来，弓起了纤细的背。然后它坐在那里思考了一会儿，笔直而威严。然后，它像一支飞镖一样，从房间里射了出来，穿过敞开的窗门，飞进了花园。

‘What’s he after?’ said Birkin, rising.
“他在找什么？”伯金站起身来说道。

The young cat trotted lordly down the path, waving his tail. He was an ordinary tabby with white paws, a slender young gentleman. A crouching, fluffy, brownish-grey cat was stealing up the side of the fence. The Mino walked statelily up to her, with manly nonchalance. She crouched before him and pressed herself on the ground in humility, a fluffy soft outcast, looking up at him with wild eyes that were green and lovely as great jewels. He looked casually down on her. So she crept a few inches further, proceeding on her way to the back door, crouching in a wonderful, soft, self-obliterating manner, and moving like a shadow.
小猫摇着尾巴，威风凛凛地沿着小路小跑。他是一只普通的虎斑猫，爪子雪白，是一位身材修长的年轻绅士。一只蹲着的、毛茸茸的、棕灰色的猫正偷偷地爬上栅栏的一侧。米诺庄严地走到她面前，带着男子气概的漫不经心。她蹲在他面前，谦卑地趴在地上，像个毛茸茸的、柔软的流浪者，抬起头用狂野的眼睛看着他，眼睛像伟大的宝石一样碧绿可爱。他漫不经心地瞧不起她。于是她又爬了几英寸，朝后门走去，以一种奇妙、柔软、自我毁灭的方式蹲下，像影子一样移动。

He, going statelily on his slim legs, walked after her, then suddenly, for pure excess, he gave her a light cuff with his paw on the side of her face. She ran off a few steps, like a blown leaf along the ground, then crouched unobtrusively, in submissive, wild patience. The Mino pretended to take no notice of her. He blinked his eyes superbly at the landscape. In a minute she drew herself together and moved softly, a fleecy brown-grey shadow, a few paces forward. She began to quicken her pace, in a moment she would be gone like a dream, when the young grey lord sprang before her, and gave her a light handsome cuff. She subsided at once, submissively.
他迈着纤细的腿，庄严地跟在她后面走，然后突然，出于纯粹的过分，他用爪子轻轻地拍了她一下，爪子放在她的脸颊上。她跑开了几步，就像地上的一片被风吹落的树叶，然后不引人注目地蹲下，表现出顺从而疯狂的耐心。米诺假装没有注意到她。他眨着眼睛，出色地看着风景。过了一会儿，她就集中精神，轻轻地移动，像一个松软的棕灰色影子，向前走了几步。她开始加快脚步，转眼间她就如梦一般消失了，这时年轻的灰领主跳到了她的面前，给了她一记轻盈英俊的袖口。她立刻就屈服了，顺从地。

‘She is a wild cat,’ said Birkin. ‘She has come in from the woods.’
“她是一只野猫，”伯金说。 “她从树林里回来了。”

The eyes of the stray cat flared round for a moment, like great green fires staring at Birkin. Then she had rushed in a soft swift rush, half way down the garden. There she paused to look round. The Mino turned his face in pure superiority to his master, and slowly closed his eyes, standing in statuesque young perfection. The wild cat’s round, green, wondering eyes were staring all the while like uncanny fires. Then again, like a shadow, she slid towards the kitchen.
流浪猫的眼睛瞬间睁得圆圆的，就像绿色的大火盯着柏金包。然后她轻柔地快速冲过花园的一半。她在那里停下来环顾四周。米诺把脸转向他的主人，表现出纯粹的优越感，然后慢慢闭上眼睛，以年轻完美的雕像般的姿态站立。野猫那双圆圆的、绿色的、好奇的眼睛一直盯着我们，就像不可思议的火焰。然后，她又像影子一样，向厨房滑去。

In a lovely springing leap, like a wind, the Mino was upon her, and had boxed her twice, very definitely, with a white, delicate fist. She sank and slid back, unquestioning. He walked after her, and cuffed her once or twice, leisurely, with sudden little blows of his magic white paws.
米诺像一阵风一样可爱地一跃而起，扑到了她身上，用一只白色的、精致的拳头，非常明确地打了她两拳。她沉了下去，向后滑去，没有任何疑问。他跟在她身后走着，悠闲地铐住了她一两次，突然用他那神奇的白色爪子轻轻地拍了一下。

‘Now why does he do that?’ cried Ursula in indignation.
“他为什么要这么做？”乌苏拉愤怒地喊道。

‘They are on intimate terms,’ said Birkin.
“他们关系亲密，”伯金说。

‘And is that why he hits her?’
“这就是他打她的原因吗？”

‘Yes,’ laughed Birkin, ‘I think he wants to make it quite obvious to her.’
“是的，”伯金笑道，“我想他想让她明白这一点。”

‘Isn’t it horrid of him!’ she cried; and going out into the garden she called to the Mino:
“他不是很可怕吗！”她叫道。她走到花园里，对米诺喊道：

‘Stop it, don’t bully. Stop hitting her.’
‘住手吧，别欺负人了。别再打她了。

The stray cat vanished like a swift, invisible shadow. The Mino glanced at Ursula, then looked from her disdainfully to his master.
流浪猫像一道无形的影子一样迅速消失。米诺看了乌苏拉一眼，然后轻蔑地把目光从她身上转向了他的主人。

‘Are you a bully, Mino?’ Birkin asked.
“你是恶霸吗，米诺？”伯金问。

The young slim cat looked at him, and slowly narrowed its eyes. Then it glanced away at the landscape, looking into the distance as if completely oblivious of the two human beings.
瘦小的猫看着他，缓缓眯起了眼睛。然后它瞥了一眼风景，望向远方，仿佛完全忘记了两个人。

‘Mino,’ said Ursula, ‘I don’t like you. You are a bully like all males.’
“米诺，”乌苏拉说，“我不喜欢你。”像所有男性一样，你是一个恶霸。”

‘No,’ said Birkin, ‘he is justified. He is not a bully. He is only insisting to the poor stray that she shall acknowledge him as a sort of fate, her own fate: because you can see she is fluffy and promiscuous as the wind. I am with him entirely. He wants superfine stability.’
“不，”伯金说，“他是有道理的。”他不是恶霸。他只是坚持对可怜的流浪者来说，她应该承认他是一种命运，她自己的命运：因为你可以看到她像风一样蓬松而混乱。我完全和他在一起。他想要超强的稳定性。”

‘Yes, I know!’ cried Ursula. ‘He wants his own way—I know what your fine words work down to—bossiness, I call it, bossiness.’
“是的，我知道！”乌苏拉喊道。 “他想按自己的方式行事——我知道你的好话会带来什么后果——专横，我称之为专横。”

The young cat again glanced at Birkin in disdain of the noisy woman.
小猫又看了一眼Birkin，对这个吵闹的女人不屑一顾。

‘I quite agree with you, Miciotto,’ said Birkin to the cat. ‘Keep your male dignity, and your higher understanding.’
“我非常同意你的观点，米乔托，”伯金对猫说。 “保持你的男性尊严，以及你更高的理解力。”

Again the Mino narrowed his eyes as if he were looking at the sun. Then, suddenly affecting to have no connection at all with the two people, he went trotting off, with assumed spontaneity and gaiety, his tail erect, his white feet blithe.
米诺再次眯起眼睛，仿佛在看着太阳。然后，他突然假装与这两个人没有任何关系，小跑着走了，假装是自发而快乐的，尾巴竖起，白色的脚欢快地走着。

‘Now he will find the belle sauvage once more, and entertain her with his superior wisdom,’ laughed Birkin.
“现在他将再次找到美丽的野蛮人，并用他卓越的智慧取悦她，”伯金笑着说。

Ursula looked at the man who stood in the garden with his hair blowing and his eyes smiling ironically, and she cried:
乌苏拉看着那个站在花园里、头发随风飘扬、眼睛里带着讽刺意味的微笑的男人，她哭道：

‘Oh it makes me so cross, this assumption of male superiority! And it is such a lie! One wouldn’t mind if there were any justification for it.’
“哦，这种男性优越感的假设让我很生气！这真是一个谎言！如果有任何理由的话，人们不会介意。

‘The wild cat,’ said Birkin, ‘doesn’t mind. She perceives that it is justified.’
“野猫，”伯金说，“并不介意。”她认为这是合理的。

‘Does she!’ cried Ursula. ‘And tell it to the Horse Marines.’
“是吗？”乌苏拉喊道。 “并将其告诉海军陆战队骑兵。”

‘To them also.’
“也对他们来说。”

‘It is just like Gerald Crich with his horse—a lust for bullying—a real Wille zur Macht—so base, so petty.’
“这就像杰拉尔德·克里奇和他的马一样——一种欺凌的欲望——一个真正的权力意志——如此卑鄙，如此小气。”

‘I agree that the Wille zur Macht is a base and petty thing. But with the Mino, it is the desire to bring this female cat into a pure stable equilibrium, a transcendent and abiding RAPPORT with the single male. Whereas without him, as you see, she is a mere stray, a fluffy sporadic bit of chaos. It is a volonte de pouvoir, if you like, a will to ability, taking pouvoir as a verb.’
“我同意权力意志是卑鄙而琐碎的事情。但对于米诺来说，我们希望让这只母猫达到纯粹稳定的平衡，与单身公猫建立一种超然且持久的融洽关系。然而，如你所见，没有他，她只是一个流浪者，一个蓬松的、零星的混乱。如果你愿意的话，这是一种 volonte de pouvoir，一种对能力的意愿，将 pouvoir 作为动词。

‘Ah—! Sophistries! It’s the old Adam.’
'啊-！诡辩！这是老亚当。

‘Oh yes. Adam kept Eve in the indestructible paradise, when he kept her single with himself, like a star in its orbit.’
'哦是的。亚当把夏娃留在了坚不可摧的天堂里，同时他让她单身在自己身边，就像一颗恒星在其轨道上运行一样。

‘Yes—yes—‘ cried Ursula, pointing her finger at him. ‘There you are—a star in its orbit! A satellite—a satellite of Mars—that’s what she is to be! There—there—you’ve given yourself away! You want a satellite, Mars and his satellite! You’ve said it—you’ve said it—you’ve dished yourself!’
“是的——是的——”乌苏拉喊道，用手指着他。 ‘你在那里——一颗在轨道上的恒星！一颗卫星——火星的卫星——这就是她的样子！那里——那里——你已经暴露了自己！你想要一颗卫星，火星和他的卫星！你已经说过了——你已经说过了——你已经把自己搞砸了！”

He stood smiling in frustration and amusement and irritation and admiration and love. She was so quick, and so lambent, like discernible fire, and so vindictive, and so rich in her dangerous flamy sensitiveness.
他站着微笑，脸上带着沮丧、有趣、恼怒、钦佩和爱意。她是那么敏捷，那么阴柔，就像可辨认的火焰，那么报复，那么充满危险的火焰敏感性。

‘I’ve not said it at all,’ he replied, ‘if you will give me a chance to speak.’
“我根本就没有说过，”他回答道，“如果你能给我一个说话的机会的话。”

‘No, no!’ she cried. ‘I won’t let you speak. You’ve said it, a satellite, you’re not going to wriggle out of it. You’ve said it.’
“不，不！”她喊道。 ‘我不会让你说话的。你已经说过了，卫星，你不会摆脱它。你已经说过了。

‘You’ll never believe now that I HAVEN’T said it,’ he answered. ‘I neither implied nor indicated nor mentioned a satellite, nor intended a satellite, never.’
“你现在永远不会相信我还没有说过这句话，”他回答道。 “我既没有暗示、表明也没有提到过一颗卫星，也没有打算一颗卫星，从来没有。”

‘YOU PREVARICATOR!’ she cried, in real indignation.
“你这个推诿者！”她愤怒地喊道。

‘Tea is ready, sir,’ said the landlady from the doorway.
“先生，茶已经准备好了。”女房东在门口说道。

They both looked at her, very much as the cats had looked at them, a little while before.
他们俩看着她，就像猫不久前看着他们一样。

‘Thank you, Mrs Daykin.’
“谢谢你，戴金夫人。”

An interrupted silence fell over the two of them, a moment of breach.
两人陷入了短暂的沉默，一瞬间的破裂。

‘Come and have tea,’ he said.
“来喝茶吧，”他说。

‘Yes, I should love it,’ she replied, gathering herself together.
“是的，我应该喜欢它，”她回答道，振作起来。

They sat facing each other across the tea table.
他们隔着茶几面对面坐着。

‘I did not say, nor imply, a satellite. I meant two single equal stars balanced in conjunction—‘
“我没有说，也没有暗示，一颗卫星。我的意思是两颗同等的星星结合在一起——‘

‘You gave yourself away, you gave away your little game completely,’ she cried, beginning at once to eat. He saw that she would take no further heed of his expostulation, so he began to pour the tea.
“你暴露了自己，你彻底暴露了你的小把戏，”她喊道，立即开始吃东西。他见她不肯再理会他的劝告，便开始倒茶。

‘What GOOD things to eat!’ she cried.
“多好吃的东西啊！”她喊道。

‘Take your own sugar,’ he said.
“你自己带糖吧，”他说。

He handed her her cup. He had everything so nice, such pretty cups and plates, painted with mauve-lustre and green, also shapely bowls and glass plates, and old spoons, on a woven cloth of pale grey and black and purple. It was very rich and fine. But Ursula could see Hermione’s influence.
他把杯子递给她。他的一切都那么漂亮，漂亮的杯子和盘子，涂着淡紫色光泽和绿色，还有形状优美的碗和玻璃盘子，还有旧勺子，放在浅灰色、黑色和紫色的编织布上。这是非常丰富和美好的。但乌苏拉可以看到赫敏的影响力。

‘Your things are so lovely!’ she said, almost angrily.
“你的东西真可爱！”她几乎生气地说。

‘I like them. It gives me real pleasure to use things that are attractive in themselves—pleasant things. And Mrs Daykin is good. She thinks everything is wonderful, for my sake.’
'我喜欢他们。使用本身有吸引力的东西给我带来真正的乐趣——令人愉快的东西。戴金夫人也很好。她认为一切都是为了我而美好。”

‘Really,’ said Ursula, ‘landladies are better than wives, nowadays. They certainly CARE a great deal more. It is much more beautiful and complete here now, than if you were married.’
“真的，”乌苏拉说，“如今，女房东比妻子更好。”他们当然更关心。现在这里比你结婚时更加美丽和完整。”

‘But think of the emptiness within,’ he laughed.
“但想想内心的空虚，”他笑道。

‘No,’ she said. ‘I am jealous that men have such perfect landladies and such beautiful lodgings. There is nothing left them to desire.’
“不，”她说。 “我嫉妒男人们拥有如此完美的女房东和如此美丽的住所。他们没有什么可渴望的。

‘In the house-keeping way, we’ll hope not. It is disgusting, people marrying for a home.’
“从内务管理的角度来看，我们希望不会。人们为了一个家而结婚，这太恶心了。”

‘Still,’ said Ursula, ‘a man has very little need for a woman now, has he?’
“不过，”乌苏拉说，“男人现在已经很少需要女人了，不是吗？”

‘In outer things, maybe—except to share his bed and bear his children. But essentially, there is just the same need as there ever was. Only nobody takes the trouble to be essential.’
“也许在外在的事情上——除了和他同床共枕、生他的孩子。”但本质上，需求与以往一样。只是没有人认为麻烦是必要的。

‘How essential?’ she said.
“有多重要？”她说。

‘I do think,’ he said, ‘that the world is only held together by the mystic conjunction, the ultimate unison between people—a bond. And the immediate bond is between man and woman.’
“我确实认为，”他说，“世界只能通过神秘的结合、人与人之间的最终统一——一种纽带——结合在一起。直接的联系是在男人和女人之间。

‘But it’s such old hat,’ said Ursula. ‘Why should love be a bond? No, I’m not having any.’
“但这实在是太老套了，”乌苏拉说。 ‘为什么爱应该成为一种纽带？不，我没有。

‘If you are walking westward,’ he said, ‘you forfeit the northern and eastward and southern direction. If you admit a unison, you forfeit all the possibilities of chaos.’
“如果你向西走，”他说，“你就会失去北方、东方和南方的方向。”如果你承认一致，你就放弃了所有混乱的可能性。

‘But love is freedom,’ she declared.
“但爱就是自由，”她宣称。

‘Don’t cant to me,’ he replied. ‘Love is a direction which excludes all other directions. It’s a freedom TOGETHER, if you like.’
“别对我说话，”他回答道。 ‘爱是一个排除所有其他方向的方向。如果你愿意的话，这是一种共同的自由。

‘No,’ she said, ‘love includes everything.’
“不，”她说，“爱包括一切。”

‘Sentimental cant,’ he replied. ‘You want the state of chaos, that’s all. It is ultimate nihilism, this freedom-in-love business, this freedom which is love and love which is freedom. As a matter of fact, if you enter into a pure unison, it is irrevocable, and it is never pure till it is irrevocable. And when it is irrevocable, it is one way, like the path of a star.’
“感情用事，”他回答道。 ‘你想要的是混乱状态，仅此而已。这是终极的虚无主义，这是爱中的自由，这种自由就是爱，爱就是自由。事实上，如果你进入纯粹的统一，它就是不可撤销的，并且在它不可撤销之前它永远不会是纯粹的。当它不可逆转时，它就是一种方式，就像星星的路径一样。

‘Ha!’ she cried bitterly. ‘It is the old dead morality.’
“哈！”她痛苦地叫道。 “这是古老而死亡的道德。”

‘No,’ he said, ‘it is the law of creation. One is committed. One must commit oneself to a conjunction with the other—for ever. But it is not selfless—it is a maintaining of the self in mystic balance and integrity—like a star balanced with another star.’
“不，”他说，“这是创造法则。”一个人已经承诺了。一个人必须致力于与另一个人永远结合。但它并不是无私的——而是以神秘的平衡和完整性来维持自我——就像一颗星星与另一颗星星保持平衡。

‘I don’t trust you when you drag in the stars,’ she said. ‘If you were quite true, it wouldn’t be necessary to be so far-fetched.’
“当你把星星拖进来时，我不相信你，”她说。 “如果你说的是真的，那就没必要这么牵强了。”

‘Don’t trust me then,’ he said, angry. ‘It is enough that I trust myself.’
“那就别相信我，”他生气地说。 “我相信自己就足够了。”

‘And that is where you make another mistake,’ she replied. ‘You DON’T trust yourself. You don’t fully believe yourself what you are saying. You don’t really want this conjunction, otherwise you wouldn’t talk so much about it, you’d get it.’
“这就是你犯另一个错误的地方，”她回答道。 ‘你不相信自己。你并不完全相信自己所说的话。你并不真的想要这种结合，否则你就不会谈论那么多，你会明白的。

He was suspended for a moment, arrested.
他被暂停了一会儿，被捕了。

‘How?’ he said.
“怎么办？”他说。

‘By just loving,’ she retorted in defiance.
“只要爱，”她挑衅地反驳道。

He was still a moment, in anger. Then he said:
他一时仍处于愤怒之中。然后他说：

‘I tell you, I don’t believe in love like that. I tell you, you want love to administer to your egoism, to subserve you. Love is a process of subservience with you—and with everybody. I hate it.’
“我告诉你，我不相信那样的爱情。我告诉你，你想要爱来管理你的利己主义，来帮助你。爱是一个对你以及对每个人都顺从的过程。我恨它。'

‘No,’ she cried, pressing back her head like a cobra, her eyes flashing. ‘It is a process of pride—I want to be proud—‘
“不，”她喊道，像眼镜蛇一样把头向后仰，眼睛里闪烁着光芒。 “这是一个自豪的过程——我想感到自豪——”

‘Proud and subservient, proud and subservient, I know you,’ he retorted dryly. ‘Proud and subservient, then subservient to the proud—I know you and your love. It is a tick-tack, tick-tack, a dance of opposites.’
“骄傲又顺从，骄傲又顺从，我了解你，”他干巴巴地反驳道。 ‘骄傲和顺从，然后屈服于骄傲——我了解你和你的爱。这是一种蜱虫，蜱虫，一种对立的舞蹈。

‘Are you sure?’ she mocked wickedly, ‘what my love is?’
“你确定吗？”她邪恶地嘲笑道，“我的爱是什么？”

‘Yes, I am,’ he retorted.
“是的，我是，”他反驳道。

‘So cocksure!’ she said. ‘How can anybody ever be right, who is so cocksure? It shows you are wrong.’
“太自信了！”她说。 ‘如此自信的人怎么可能是对的呢？这表明你错了。

He was silent in chagrin.
他懊恼地沉默了。

They had talked and struggled till they were both wearied out.
他们交谈着，挣扎着，直到两人都精疲力竭。

‘Tell me about yourself and your people,’ he said.
“告诉我关于你自己和你的人民的事，”他说。

And she told him about the Brangwens, and about her mother, and about Skrebensky, her first love, and about her later experiences. He sat very still, watching her as she talked. And he seemed to listen with reverence. Her face was beautiful and full of baffled light as she told him all the things that had hurt her or perplexed her so deeply. He seemed to warm and comfort his soul at the beautiful light of her nature.
她向他讲述了布兰文一家、她的母亲、她的初恋斯克雷本斯基，以及她后来的经历。他一动不动地坐着，看着她说话。他似乎怀着崇敬的心情听着。当她告诉他所有伤害过她或让她深深困惑的事情时，她的脸很美丽，充满了困惑的光芒。他似乎在她天性的美丽光芒下温暖和安慰了他的灵魂。

‘If she REALLY could pledge herself,’ he thought to himself, with passionate insistence but hardly any hope. Yet a curious little irresponsible laughter appeared in his heart.
“如果她真的能保证自己就好了，”他心想，带着强烈的坚持，但几乎没有任何希望。然而他的心里却浮现出一丝好奇的、不负责任的小笑声。

‘We have all suffered so much,’ he mocked, ironically.
“我们都受了这么多苦，”他讽刺地嘲笑道。

She looked up at him, and a flash of wild gaiety went over her face, a strange flash of yellow light coming from her eyes.
她抬头看着他，脸上闪过一丝狂野的喜悦，眼中闪烁着奇怪的黄色光芒。

‘Haven’t we!’ she cried, in a high, reckless cry. ‘It is almost absurd, isn’t it?’
“我们不是吗！”她大声、鲁莽地喊道。 “这几乎是荒谬的，不是吗？”

‘Quite absurd,’ he said. ‘Suffering bores me, any more.’
“太荒谬了，”他说。 “痛苦让我不再感到无聊。”

‘So it does me.’
“我也是这样。”

He was almost afraid of the mocking recklessness of her splendid face. Here was one who would go to the whole lengths of heaven or hell, whichever she had to go. And he mistrusted her, he was afraid of a woman capable of such abandon, such dangerous thoroughness of destructivity. Yet he chuckled within himself also.
他几乎害怕她美丽的脸庞上那种嘲讽的鲁莽。这是一个愿意去天堂或地狱的人，无论她必须去哪一个。他不信任她，他害怕一个女人能够如此放纵，如此危险的彻底破坏。然而他内心也暗自窃笑。

She came over to him and put her hand on his shoulder, looking down at him with strange golden-lighted eyes, very tender, but with a curious devilish look lurking underneath.
她走到他身边，把手搭在他的肩膀上，低头看着他，双眸里闪烁着奇异的金光，十分温柔，但底下却隐藏着一种好奇的恶魔般的神情。

‘Say you love me, say ‘my love’ to me,’ she pleaded
“说你爱我，对我说‘我的爱’，”她恳求道

He looked back into her eyes, and saw. His face flickered with sardonic comprehension.
他回头看着她的眼睛，看到了。他的脸上闪烁着讽刺的理解。

‘I love you right enough,’ he said, grimly. ‘But I want it to be something else.’
“我爱你是对的，”他冷酷地说。 “但我希望它是别的东西。”

‘But why? But why?’ she insisted, bending her wonderful luminous face to him. ‘Why isn’t it enough?’
'但为什么？但为什么呢？”她坚持道，同时向他弯下她那张美丽发光的脸。 “为什么还不够？”

‘Because we can go one better,’ he said, putting his arms round her.
“因为我们可以做得更好，”他说着，用双臂搂住了她。

‘No, we can’t,’ she said, in a strong, voluptuous voice of yielding. ‘We can only love each other. Say ‘my love’ to me, say it, say it.’
“不，我们不能，”她用强烈而性感的声音说道。 ‘我们只能彼此相爱。对我说‘我的爱’，说出来，说出来。”

She put her arms round his neck. He enfolded her, and kissed her subtly, murmuring in a subtle voice of love, and irony, and submission:
她用双臂搂住他的脖子。他搂住她，巧妙地吻了她，用一种充满爱、讽刺和顺服的微妙声音低声说道：

‘Yes,—my love, yes,—my love. Let love be enough then. I love you then—I love you. I’m bored by the rest.’
‘是的，我的爱人，是的，我的爱人。那就让爱就足够了。那么我爱你——我爱你。我对其余的感到无聊。

‘Yes,’ she murmured, nestling very sweet and close to him.
“是的，”她低声说道，非常甜蜜地依偎在他身边。

CHAPTER XIV
第十四章

WATER-PARTY
水上派对

Every year Mr Crich gave a more or less public water-party on the lake. There was a little pleasure-launch on Willey Water and several rowing boats, and guests could take tea either in the marquee that was set up in the grounds of the house, or they could picnic in the shade of the great walnut tree at the boat-house by the lake. This year the staff of the Grammar-School was invited, along with the chief officials of the firm. Gerald and the younger Criches did not care for this party, but it had become customary now, and it pleased the father, as being the only occasion when he could gather some people of the district together in festivity with him. For he loved to give pleasures to his dependents and to those poorer than himself. But his children preferred the company of their own equals in wealth. They hated their inferiors’ humility or gratitude or awkwardness.
克里奇先生每年都会在湖上举办或多或少的公共水上派对。威利湖 (Willey Water) 和几艘划艇上有一场小型游乐活动，客人可以在房子庭院里搭建的大帐篷里喝茶，也可以在船上的大胡桃树树荫下野餐-湖边的房子。今年，文法学校的工作人员以及公司的主要官员受邀参加。杰拉德和小克里奇斯并不喜欢这个聚会，但现在这已经成为惯例，父亲很高兴，因为这是他能聚集该地区的一些人与他一起庆祝的唯一场合。因为他喜欢给他的家属和那些比他贫穷的人带来快乐。但他的孩子们更喜欢与自己财富相等的人为伴。他们讨厌下级的谦逊、感激或尴尬。

Nevertheless they were willing to attend at this festival, as they had done almost since they were children, the more so, as they all felt a little guilty now, and unwilling to thwart their father any more, since he was so ill in health. Therefore, quite cheerfully Laura prepared to take her mother’s place as hostess, and Gerald assumed responsibility for the amusements on the water.
尽管如此，他们还是愿意参加这个节日，就像他们从小就开始做的那样，更是如此，因为他们现在都感到有点内疚，并且不愿意再阻止他们的父亲，因为他的健康状况如此糟糕。于是，劳拉很高兴地准备接替母亲担任女主人，而杰拉德则负责水上娱乐活动。

Birkin had written to Ursula saying he expected to see her at the party, and Gudrun, although she scorned the patronage of the Criches, would nevertheless accompany her mother and father if the weather were fine.
伯金写信给乌苏拉说，他希望在聚会上见到她，而古德伦虽然鄙视克里奇夫妇的赞助，但如果天气晴朗，她仍然会陪伴她的父母。

The day came blue and full of sunshine, with little wafts of wind. The sisters both wore dresses of white crepe, and hats of soft grass. But Gudrun had a sash of brilliant black and pink and yellow colour wound broadly round her waist, and she had pink silk stockings, and black and pink and yellow decoration on the brim of her hat, weighing it down a little. She carried also a yellow silk coat over her arm, so that she looked remarkable, like a painting from the Salon. Her appearance was a sore trial to her father, who said angrily:
那天天气晴朗，阳光明媚，微风徐徐。姐妹俩都穿着白色绉纱连衣裙，戴着软草帽子。但古德伦的腰间系着一条亮黑色、粉红色和黄色的腰带，脚上穿着粉红色的丝袜，帽檐上有黑色、粉红色和黄色的装饰，让帽子显得有些沉重。她手臂上还搭着一件黄色丝绸外套，显得格外引人注目，就像沙龙里的一幅画。她的出现对她的父亲来说是一次痛苦的考验，父亲愤怒地说：

‘Don’t you think you might as well get yourself up for a Christmas cracker, an’ha’ done with it?’
“你不觉得不如起来吃个圣诞拉炮吗？就这样吧？”

But Gudrun looked handsome and brilliant, and she wore her clothes in pure defiance. When people stared at her, and giggled after her, she made a point of saying loudly, to Ursula:
但古德伦看起来英俊而光彩照人，她穿着衣服充满了纯粹的挑衅。当人们盯着她看，并在她身后咯咯地笑时，她特意对乌苏拉大声说道：

‘Regarde, regarde ces gens-la! Ne sont-ils pas des hiboux incroyables?’ And with the words of French in her mouth, she would look over her shoulder at the giggling party.
‘敬礼，敬礼各位！ Ne sont-ils pas des hiboux incroyables？”她嘴里念叨着法语，回头看着咯咯笑的队伍。

‘No, really, it’s impossible!’ Ursula would reply distinctly. And so the two girls took it out of their universal enemy. But their father became more and more enraged.
“不，真的，这不可能！”乌苏拉明确地回答。就这样，两个女孩从她们的共同敌人手中夺走了它。但他们的父亲却越来越愤怒。

Ursula was all snowy white, save that her hat was pink, and entirely without trimming, and her shoes were dark red, and she carried an orange-coloured coat. And in this guise they were walking all the way to Shortlands, their father and mother going in front.
乌苏拉全身雪白，除了她的帽子是粉红色的，而且完全没有修剪，她的鞋子是深红色的，她穿着一件橙色的外套。就这样，他们一路走到肖特兰兹，他们的父亲和母亲走在前面。

They were laughing at their mother, who, dressed in a summer material of black and purple stripes, and wearing a hat of purple straw, was setting forth with much more of the shyness and trepidation of a young girl than her daughters ever felt, walking demurely beside her husband, who, as usual, looked rather crumpled in his best suit, as if he were the father of a young family and had been holding the baby whilst his wife got dressed.
她们嘲笑她们的母亲，她穿着黑色和紫色条纹的夏季布料，戴着一顶紫色草帽，带着比她的女儿们更多的年轻女孩的害羞和恐惧，走着走着。她的丈夫端庄地站在她身边，像往常一样，他穿着最好的西装，看起来相当皱巴巴的，仿佛他是一个年轻家庭的父亲，在妻子穿衣服时一直抱着孩子。

‘Look at the young couple in front,’ said Gudrun calmly. Ursula looked at her mother and father, and was suddenly seized with uncontrollable laughter. The two girls stood in the road and laughed till the tears ran down their faces, as they caught sight again of the shy, unworldly couple of their parents going on ahead.
“看看前面的年轻夫妇，”古德伦平静地说。乌苏拉看着她的父母，突然忍不住笑了起来。两个女孩站在路边，笑得泪流满面，再次看到前面那对害羞、不谙世事的父母夫妇。

‘We are roaring at you, mother,’ called Ursula, helplessly following after her parents.
“我们正在向你咆哮，妈妈，”乌苏拉无助地跟在父母身后喊道。

Mrs Brangwen turned round with a slightly puzzled, exasperated look. ‘Oh indeed!’ she said. ‘What is there so very funny about ME, I should like to know?’
布兰文夫人转过身来，脸上带着一丝困惑和恼怒的表情。 “哦，确实如此！”她说。 “我想知道我到底有什么好笑的？”

She could not understand that there could be anything amiss with her appearance. She had a perfect calm sufficiency, an easy indifference to any criticism whatsoever, as if she were beyond it. Her clothes were always rather odd, and as a rule slip-shod, yet she wore them with a perfect ease and satisfaction. Whatever she had on, so long as she was barely tidy, she was right, beyond remark; such an aristocrat she was by instinct.
她不明白自己的外表可能有什么问题。她有一种完美的冷静，对任何批评都表现出漠不关心的态度，仿佛她超越了它。她的衣服总是很奇怪，而且通常都是邋遢的，但她穿着它们却非常轻松和满意。无论她穿什么，只要她勉强整洁，她都是对的，这是无可置疑的。她本能地就是一位贵族。

‘You look so stately, like a country Baroness,’ said Ursula, laughing with a little tenderness at her mother’s naive puzzled air.
“你看起来很庄严，就像一位乡村男爵夫人，”乌苏拉说，看着她母亲天真的困惑的表情，带着一点温柔的笑声。

‘JUST like a country Baroness!’ chimed in Gudrun. Now the mother’s natural hauteur became self-conscious, and the girls shrieked again.
“就像乡村男爵夫人一样！”古德伦插嘴道。现在，母亲天生的傲慢变得不自然，女孩们又尖叫起来。

‘Go home, you pair of idiots, great giggling idiots!’ cried the father inflamed with irritation.
“回家吧，你们两个白痴，咯咯笑的大白痴！”父亲恼怒地喊道。

‘Mm-m-er!’ booed Ursula, pulling a face at his crossness.
“嗯——嗯——呃！”乌苏拉发出嘘声，因他的脾气而皱起眉头。

The yellow lights danced in his eyes, he leaned forward in real rage.
黄色的光芒在他的眼中跳动，他愤怒地向前倾身。

‘Don’t be so silly as to take any notice of the great gabies,’ said Mrs Brangwen, turning on her way.
“别傻到对这些伟大的盖比鸟没有任何注意，”布兰文夫人说着，转身上路。

‘I’ll see if I’m going to be followed by a pair of giggling yelling jackanapes—‘ he cried vengefully.
“我要看看我是否会被一对咯咯大叫的杰克纳猿跟踪——”他复仇地喊道。

The girls stood still, laughing helplessly at his fury, upon the path beside the hedge.
女孩们一动不动地站在树篱旁的小路上，对他的愤怒无助地大笑。

‘Why you’re as silly as they are, to take any notice,’ said Mrs Brangwen also becoming angry now he was really enraged.
“为什么你像他们一样愚蠢，竟然不去注意，”布兰文夫人说，现在他真的被激怒了，她也生气了。

‘There are some people coming, father,’ cried Ursula, with mocking warning. He glanced round quickly, and went on to join his wife, walking stiff with rage. And the girls followed, weak with laughter.
“有一些人来了，父亲，”乌苏拉喊道，带着嘲讽的警告。他迅速环顾四周，然后走到妻子身边，气得浑身僵硬。女孩们跟在后面，笑得虚弱。

When the people had passed by, Brangwen cried in a loud, stupid voice:
当人们经过时，布兰文用愚蠢的声音大声喊道：

‘I’m going back home if there’s any more of this. I’m damned if I’m going to be made a fool of in this fashion, in the public road.’
“如果还有这样的事，我就回家了。”如果我在公共道路上以这种方式被人愚弄，那我就该死了。

He was really out of temper. At the sound of his blind, vindictive voice, the laughter suddenly left the girls, and their hearts contracted with contempt. They hated his words ‘in the public road.’ What did they care for the public road? But Gudrun was conciliatory.
他实在是没脾气了。听到他那盲目的、充满斗气的声音，女孩们顿时笑声消失，心头因轻蔑而收缩。他们讨厌他所说的“在公共道路上”。他们关心公共道路什么呢？但古德伦表现得很和解。

‘But we weren’t laughing to HURT you,’ she cried, with an uncouth gentleness which made her parents uncomfortable. ‘We were laughing because we’re fond of you.’
“但我们笑并不是为了伤害你，”她大声喊道，语气里充满了粗鲁的温柔，这让她的父母感到不舒服。 “我们笑是因为我们喜欢你。”

‘We’ll walk on in front, if they are SO touchy,’ said Ursula, angry. And in this wise they arrived at Willey Water. The lake was blue and fair, the meadows sloped down in sunshine on one side, the thick dark woods dropped steeply on the other. The little pleasure-launch was fussing out from the shore, twanging its music, crowded with people, flapping its paddles. Near the boat-house was a throng of gaily-dressed persons, small in the distance. And on the high-road, some of the common people were standing along the hedge, looking at the festivity beyond, enviously, like souls not admitted to paradise.
“如果他们这么敏感的话，我们就走在前面，”乌苏拉生气地说。就这样，他们到达了威利沃特。湖水蔚蓝而美丽，一侧的草地在阳光下倾斜，另一侧是茂密的深色树林。那艘小型游乐船正从岸边忙忙碌碌地驶出，发出音乐，船上挤满了人，拍打着船桨。船库附近有一群衣着华丽的人，距离很远。而在大路上，一些老百姓站在树篱边，羡慕地看着远处的节日，就像那些没有进入天堂的灵魂一样。

‘My eye!’ said Gudrun, sotto voce, looking at the motley of guests, ‘there’s a pretty crowd if you like! Imagine yourself in the midst of that, my dear.’
“我的眼睛！”古德伦看着形形色色的客人，低声说道，“如果你愿意的话，这里有很多人！”想象一下你自己正处于其中，亲爱的。

Gudrun’s apprehensive horror of people in the mass unnerved Ursula. ‘It looks rather awful,’ she said anxiously.
古德伦对人群中的人们的恐惧让乌苏拉感到不安。 “看起来很糟糕，”她焦急地说。

‘And imagine what they’ll be like—IMAGINE!’ said Gudrun, still in that unnerving, subdued voice. Yet she advanced determinedly.
“想象一下他们会是什么样子——想象一下！”古德伦说道，声音仍然是那种令人不安、压抑的声音。但她仍坚定地前进。

‘I suppose we can get away from them,’ said Ursula anxiously.
“我想我们可以摆脱他们，”乌苏拉焦急地说。

‘We’re in a pretty fix if we can’t,’ said Gudrun. Her extreme ironic loathing and apprehension was very trying to Ursula.
“如果我们做不到，我们就陷入了困境，”古德伦说。她极度讽刺的厌恶和忧虑让乌苏拉感到非常难受。

‘We needn’t stay,’ she said.
“我们不需要留下来，”她说。

‘I certainly shan’t stay five minutes among that little lot,’ said Gudrun. They advanced nearer, till they saw policemen at the gates.
“我当然不会在那一小群人中间停留五分钟，”古德伦说。他们走得更近了，直到看到门口有警察。

‘Policemen to keep you in, too!’ said Gudrun. ‘My word, this is a beautiful affair.’
“警察也要把你关起来！”古德伦说。 “我保证，这是一件美好的事情。”

‘We’d better look after father and mother,’ said Ursula anxiously.
“我们最好照顾爸爸和妈妈，”乌苏拉焦急地说。

‘Mother’s PERFECTLY capable of getting through this little celebration,’ said Gudrun with some contempt.
“母亲完全有能力度过这个小小的庆祝活动。”古德伦轻蔑地说。

But Ursula knew that her father felt uncouth and angry and unhappy, so she was far from her ease. They waited outside the gate till their parents came up. The tall, thin man in his crumpled clothes was unnerved and irritable as a boy, finding himself on the brink of this social function. He did not feel a gentleman, he did not feel anything except pure exasperation.
但乌苏拉知道她的父亲感到粗鲁、愤怒和不高兴，所以她远没有那么轻松。他们在门外等着，直到父母来了。这个穿着皱巴巴的衣服、又高又瘦的男人像个男孩一样显得不安和易怒，发现自己处于这种社交功能的边缘。他不觉得自己有什么绅士风度，除了纯粹的恼怒之外，他什么也感觉不到。

Ursula took her place at his side, they gave their tickets to the policeman, and passed in on to the grass, four abreast; the tall, hot, ruddy-dark man with his narrow boyish brow drawn with irritation, the fresh-faced, easy woman, perfectly collected though her hair was slipping on one side, then Gudrun, her eyes round and dark and staring, her full soft face impassive, almost sulky, so that she seemed to be backing away in antagonism even whilst she was advancing; and then Ursula, with the odd, brilliant, dazzled look on her face, that always came when she was in some false situation.
乌苏拉在他身边就座，他们把票交给警察，然后四人并排走到草地上。那个身材高大、身材火辣、肤色红润的男人，男孩般的窄眉因恼怒而皱起；那个面色清新、随和的女人，虽然头发从一侧滑落，但仍完全镇定下来；然后是古德伦，她的眼睛又圆又黑，凝视着，她的眼睛充满了活力。她的脸色柔和，面无表情，几乎是闷闷不乐，因此即使在前进的同时，她似乎也在敌意地后退；然后是乌苏拉，脸上带着一种奇怪的、灿烂的、眼花缭乱的表情，当她处于某种错误的情况下时，总会出现这种表情。

Birkin was the good angel. He came smiling to them with his affected social grace, that somehow was never QUITE right. But he took off his hat and smiled at them with a real smile in his eyes, so that Brangwen cried out heartily in relief:
柏金 (Birkin) 是善良的天使。他带着一种做作的社交优雅向他们微笑，但不知怎么的，这从来都不太对劲。但他摘下帽子，对他们微笑，眼中带着真正的笑意，让布兰文如释重负地大喊道：

‘How do you do? You’re better, are you?’
'你好吗？你好多了，是吗？

‘Yes, I’m better. How do you do, Mrs Brangwen? I know Gudrun and Ursula very well.’
‘是的，我好多了。布兰文夫人，你好吗？我很了解古德伦和乌苏拉。”

His eyes smiled full of natural warmth. He had a soft, flattering manner with women, particularly with women who were not young.
他的眼睛里充满了自然的微笑和温暖。他对待女性，尤其是年纪不小的女性，态度温和、讨好。

‘Yes,’ said Mrs Brangwen, cool but yet gratified. ‘I have heard them speak of you often enough.’
“是的，”布兰文夫人冷静但又很满意地说道。 “我经常听他们谈起你。”

He laughed. Gudrun looked aside, feeling she was being belittled. People were standing about in groups, some women were sitting in the shade of the walnut tree, with cups of tea in their hands, a waiter in evening dress was hurrying round, some girls were simpering with parasols, some young men, who had just come in from rowing, were sitting cross-legged on the grass, coatless, their shirt-sleeves rolled up in manly fashion, their hands resting on their white flannel trousers, their gaudy ties floating about, as they laughed and tried to be witty with the young damsels.
他笑了。古德伦看向一边，感觉自己被贬低了。人们三五成群地站着，有的妇女坐在核桃树荫下，手里端着一杯茶，穿着晚礼服的侍者在匆匆忙忙，有的女孩打着阳伞傻笑，有的年轻男子，刚刚才出去。划完船回来，盘腿坐在草地上，没穿外套，衬衫袖子挽起，很有男子气概，双手搭在白色法兰绒长裤上，花哨的领带飘来飘去，一边笑着，一边试图与人开玩笑。年轻的姑娘们。

‘Why,’ thought Gudrun churlishly, ‘don’t they have the manners to put their coats on, and not to assume such intimacy in their appearance.’
“为什么，”古德伦粗暴地想，“他们没有礼貌地穿上外套，也没有表现出如此亲密的样子。”

She abhorred the ordinary young man, with his hair plastered back, and his easy-going chumminess.
她厌恶这个普通的、头发梳在脑后、和蔼可亲的年轻人。

Hermione Roddice came up, in a handsome gown of white lace, trailing an enormous silk shawl blotched with great embroidered flowers, and balancing an enormous plain hat on her head. She looked striking, astonishing, almost macabre, so tall, with the fringe of her great cream-coloured vividly-blotched shawl trailing on the ground after her, her thick hair coming low over her eyes, her face strange and long and pale, and the blotches of brilliant colour drawn round her.
赫敏·罗迪斯走了过来，穿着一件漂亮的白色蕾丝礼服，拖着一条巨大的丝绸披肩，上面绣满了大花，头上戴着一顶巨大的朴素帽子。她看起来引人注目，令人惊讶，几乎令人毛骨悚然，那么高，她的奶油色大披肩的边缘拖在她身后的地上，她浓密的头发低垂在她的眼睛上，她的脸奇怪，长而苍白，她周围画着绚丽的色彩斑点。

‘Doesn’t she look WEIRD!’ Gudrun heard some girls titter behind her. And she could have killed them.
“她看起来不奇怪吗？”古德伦听到一些女孩在她身后窃笑。她本可以杀了他们。

‘How do you do!’ sang Hermione, coming up very kindly, and glancing slowly over Gudrun’s father and mother. It was a trying moment, exasperating for Gudrun. Hermione was really so strongly entrenched in her class superiority, she could come up and know people out of simple curiosity, as if they were creatures on exhibition. Gudrun would do the same herself. But she resented being in the position when somebody might do it to her.
“你们好！”赫敏唱道，她非常友善地走过来，慢慢地扫视着古德伦的父母。这是一个艰难的时刻，让古德伦感到恼火。赫敏的阶级优越感确实如此强烈，她可以出于简单的好奇心来认识别人，就好像他们是展览中的生物一样。古德伦自己也会做同样的事。但她讨厌有人可能对她做这种事。

Hermione, very remarkable, and distinguishing the Brangwens very much, led them along to where Laura Crich stood receiving the guests.
赫敏非常了不起，对布兰文一家也很挑剔，她带领他们来到劳拉·克里奇接待客人的地方。

‘This is Mrs Brangwen,’ sang Hermione, and Laura, who wore a stiff embroidered linen dress, shook hands and said she was glad to see her. Then Gerald came up, dressed in white, with a black and brown blazer, and looking handsome. He too was introduced to the Brangwen parents, and immediately he spoke to Mrs Brangwen as if she were a lady, and to Brangwen as if he were NOT a gentleman. Gerlad was so obvious in his demeanour. He had to shake hands with his left hand, because he had hurt his right, and carried it, bandaged up, in the pocket of his jacket. Gudrun was VERY thankful that none of her party asked him what was the matter with the hand.
“这是布兰文夫人，”赫敏唱道，劳拉穿着一件硬挺的刺绣亚麻连衣裙，和她握手说很高兴见到她。然后杰拉德走了过来，一身白衣，内搭黑棕色西装外套，看上去很英俊。他也被介绍给了布兰文的父母，他立即与布兰文夫人说话，就好像她是一位女士一样，而与布兰文说话，就好像他不是一位绅士一样。杰拉德的举止非常明显。他不得不用左手握手，因为他的右手受伤了，他把包着绷带的左手放在夹克的口袋里。古德伦非常庆幸，她的同伴中没有人问他这只手怎么了。

The steam launch was fussing in, all its music jingling, people calling excitedly from on board. Gerald went to see to the debarkation, Birkin was getting tea for Mrs Brangwen, Brangwen had joined a Grammar-School group, Hermione was sitting down by their mother, the girls went to the landing-stage to watch the launch come in.
蒸汽船开始忙碌起来，所有的音乐都叮当作响，船上的人们兴奋地喊着。杰拉德去送登船，伯金正在为布兰文夫人倒茶，布兰文加入了文法学校的团体，赫敏坐在她们母亲身边，女孩们走到登陆台观看汽艇驶入。

She hooted and tooted gaily, then her paddles were silent, the ropes were thrown ashore, she drifted in with a little bump. Immediately the passengers crowded excitedly to come ashore.
她欢快地叫了又叫，然后她的桨安静了，绳子被扔到岸上，她轻轻一颠就漂了进去。乘客们立即兴奋地涌上岸。

‘Wait a minute, wait a minute,’ shouted Gerald in sharp command.
“等一下，等一下，”杰拉尔德以尖锐的命令喊道。

They must wait till the boat was tight on the ropes, till the small gangway was put out. Then they streamed ashore, clamouring as if they had come from America.
他们必须等到船被绳索紧紧抓住，直到小舷梯被放下。然后他们涌上岸，大声嚷嚷，好像他们是从美国来的一样。

‘Oh it’s SO nice!’ the young girls were crying. ‘It’s quite lovely.’
“噢，太好了！”年轻女孩们哭着说。 “真是太可爱了。”

The waiters from on board ran out to the boat-house with baskets, the captain lounged on the little bridge. Seeing all safe, Gerald came to Gudrun and Ursula.
船上的侍者提着篮子跑到船库，船长则懒洋洋地躺在小桥上。看到一切安全后，杰拉德来到古德伦和乌苏拉身边。

‘You wouldn’t care to go on board for the next trip, and have tea there?’ he asked.
“下次旅行你不愿意上船并在那里喝茶吗？”他问道。

‘No thanks,’ said Gudrun coldly.
“不用了，谢谢。”古德伦冷冷地说。

‘You don’t care for the water?’
“你不喜欢水吗？”

‘For the water? Yes, I like it very much.’
‘为了水？是的，我非常喜欢它。'

He looked at her, his eyes searching.
他看着她，目光探寻。

‘You don’t care for going on a launch, then?’
“那么你不喜欢参加发射吗？”

She was slow in answering, and then she spoke slowly.
她缓慢地回答，然后慢慢地说话。

‘No,’ she said. ‘I can’t say that I do.’ Her colour was high, she seemed angry about something.
“不，”她说。 “我不能说我愿意。”她的脸色很红，似乎对什么事情很生气。

‘Un peu trop de monde,’ said Ursula, explaining.
“Un peu trop de monde，”乌苏拉解释道。

‘Eh? TROP DE MONDE!’ He laughed shortly. ‘Yes there’s a fair number of ‘em.’
‘呃？ “TROP DE MONDE！”他短促地笑了起来。 “是的，有相当数量的‘他们’。”

Gudrun turned on him brilliantly.
古德伦出色地转向他。

‘Have you ever been from Westminster Bridge to Richmond on one of the Thames steamers?’ she cried.
“你曾经乘坐泰晤士河轮船从威斯敏斯特桥到里士满吗？”她喊道。

‘No,’ he said, ‘I can’t say I have.’
“不，”他说，“我不能说我有。”

‘Well, it’s one of the most VILE experiences I’ve ever had.’ She spoke rapidly and excitedly, the colour high in her cheeks. ‘There was absolutely nowhere to sit down, nowhere, a man just above sang ‘Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep’ the WHOLE way; he was blind and he had a small organ, one of those portable organs, and he expected money; so you can imagine what THAT was like; there came a constant smell of luncheon from below, and puffs of hot oily machinery; the journey took hours and hours and hours; and for miles, literally for miles, dreadful boys ran with us on the shore, in that AWFUL Thames mud, going in UP TO THE WAIST—they had their trousers turned back, and they went up to their hips in that indescribable Thames mud, their faces always turned to us, and screaming, exactly like carrion creatures, screaming ‘‘Ere y’are sir, ‘ere y’are sir, ‘ere y’are sir,’ exactly like some foul carrion objects, perfectly obscene; and paterfamilias on board, laughing when the boys went right down in that awful mud, occasionally throwing them a ha’penny. And if you’d seen the intent look on the faces of these boys, and the way they darted in the filth when a coin was flung—really, no vulture or jackal could dream of approaching them, for foulness. I NEVER would go on a pleasure boat again—never.’
“嗯，这是我经历过的最肮脏的经历之一。”她语速很快，很兴奋，脸颊涨红。 “根本没有地方可以坐下来，没有地方，一个人就在上面唱着‘Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep’。”他是个盲人，但他有一个小器官，一种便携式器官，他希望得到钱。所以你可以想象那是什么样子；楼下不断传来午餐的香味，还有热油机器的味道。旅程花了几个小时、几个小时、几个小时；可怕的男孩们在岸上和我们一起跑了几英里，实际上是几英里，在那可怕的泰晤士泥浆中，一直跑到腰部——他们把裤子翻到后面，他们在那难以形容的泰晤士泥浆中跑到臀部，他们的脸总是转向我们，尖叫着，就像腐肉生物一样，尖叫着“你是先生，你是先生，你是先生”，就像一些肮脏的腐肉物体一样，非常淫秽；船上的家长们，当孩子们掉进那可怕的泥浆里时，他们大笑起来，偶尔扔给他们半个便士。如果你看到这些男孩脸上专注的表情，以及投掷硬币时他们在污秽中冲刺的样子，真的，没有秃鹫或豺狼会想到接近他们，因为他们是肮脏的。我再也不会乘坐游船了——永远不会。

Gerald watched her all the time she spoke, his eyes glittering with faint rousedness. It was not so much what she said; it was she herself who roused him, roused him with a small, vivid pricking.
杰拉尔德在她说话的整个过程中都注视着她，他的眼睛里闪烁着微弱的兴奋。与其说是她说的，不如说是她说的。是她自己唤醒了他，用一种小小的、生动的刺痛唤醒了他。

‘Of course,’ he said, ‘every civilised body is bound to have its vermin.’
“当然，”他说，“每个文明体都必然有害虫。”

‘Why?’ cried Ursula. ‘I don’t have vermin.’
“为什么？”乌苏拉喊道。 “我没有害虫。”

‘And it’s not that—it’s the QUALITY of the whole thing—paterfamilias laughing and thinking it sport, and throwing the ha’pennies, and materfamilias spreading her fat little knees and eating, continually eating—‘ replied Gudrun.
“并不是这样的——而是整个事情的质量——家长们笑着，认为这是运动，扔着半便士，而家长们则摊开她肥胖的小膝盖，吃着，不停地吃着——”古德伦回答道。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula. ‘It isn’t the boys so much who are vermin; it’s the people themselves, the whole body politic, as you call it.’
“是的，”乌苏拉说。 “男孩们并不是害虫，而是害虫。”正如你所说，这是人民本身，整个政治体。

Gerald laughed.
杰拉尔德笑了。

‘Never mind,’ he said. ‘You shan’t go on the launch.’
“没关系，”他说。 “你不能参加发射。”

Gudrun flushed quickly at his rebuke.
古德伦因他的斥责而脸红了。

There were a few moments of silence. Gerald, like a sentinel, was watching the people who were going on to the boat. He was very good-looking and self-contained, but his air of soldierly alertness was rather irritating.
一阵沉默。杰拉德就像一个哨兵，注视着上船的人们。他长得非常好看，也很内向，但他那军人般的戒备气息却让人有些恼火。

‘Will you have tea here then, or go across to the house, where there’s a tent on the lawn?’ he asked.
“那你要在这里喝茶吗？还是去那栋房子，那里的草坪上有一个帐篷？”他问。

‘Can’t we have a rowing boat, and get out?’ asked Ursula, who was always rushing in too fast.
“我们不能有一艘划艇，然后出去吗？”乌苏拉问道，她总是冲得太快。

‘To get out?’ smiled Gerald.
“出去？”杰拉尔德微笑着说。

‘You see,’ cried Gudrun, flushing at Ursula’s outspoken rudeness, ‘we don’t know the people, we are almost COMPLETE strangers here.’
“你看，”古德伦喊道，乌苏拉直言不讳的粗鲁让他脸红了，“我们不认识这里的人，我们在这里几乎完全是陌生人。”

‘Oh, I can soon set you up with a few acquaintances,’ he said easily.
“哦，我很快就能给你介绍几个熟人，”他轻松地说。

Gudrun looked at him, to see if it were ill-meant. Then she smiled at him.
古德伦看着他，想看看他是不是恶意的。然后她对他微笑。

‘Ah,’ she said, ‘you know what we mean. Can’t we go up there, and explore that coast?’ She pointed to a grove on the hillock of the meadow-side, near the shore half way down the lake. ‘That looks perfectly lovely. We might even bathe. Isn’t it beautiful in this light. Really, it’s like one of the reaches of the Nile—as one imagines the Nile.’
“啊，”她说，“你知道我们的意思。”我们不能去那里探索一下海岸吗？”她指着草地边的小山丘上的一片小树林，靠近湖边的海岸。 ‘这看起来非常可爱。我们甚至可以洗澡。在这个光线下是不是很美呢。真的，它就像尼罗河的河段之一——正如人们想象的那样。”

Gerald smiled at her factitious enthusiasm for the distant spot.
杰拉德对她对远方的不自然的热情微笑起来。

‘You’re sure it’s far enough off?’ he asked ironically, adding at once: ‘Yes, you might go there, if we could get a boat. They seem to be all out.’
“你确定那儿足够远吗？”他讽刺地问道，并立即补充道：“是的，如果我们能找到一艘船，你可能会去那里。”他们似乎都出去了。

He looked round the lake and counted the rowing boats on its surface.
他环视湖面，数着湖面上划艇的数量。

‘How lovely it would be!’ cried Ursula wistfully.
“那该多好呀！”乌苏拉若有所思地喊道。

‘And don’t you want tea?’ he said.
“你不想喝茶吗？”他说。

‘Oh,’ said Gudrun, ‘we could just drink a cup, and be off.’
“哦，”古德伦说，“我们喝一杯就可以走了。”

He looked from one to the other, smiling. He was somewhat offended—yet sporting.
他从一个人看了另一个人，微笑着。他有点生气——但又很高兴。

‘Can you manage a boat pretty well?’ he asked.
“你能驾驭一艘船吗？”他问道。

‘Yes,’ replied Gudrun, coldly, ‘pretty well.’
“是的，”古珍冷冷地回答，“很好。”

‘Oh yes,’ cried Ursula. ‘We can both of us row like water-spiders.’
“哦，是的，”乌苏拉喊道。 “我们俩都可以像水蜘蛛一样划船。”

‘You can? There’s light little canoe of mine, that I didn’t take out for fear somebody should drown themselves. Do you think you’d be safe in that?’
'你可以？我有一条轻便的小独木舟，我没有把它拿出来，因为担心有人淹死。你认为这样你会安全吗？

‘Oh perfectly,’ said Gudrun.
“哦，完美，”古德伦说。

‘What an angel!’ cried Ursula.
“真是一位天使啊！”乌苏拉喊道。

‘Don’t, for MY sake, have an accident—because I’m responsible for the water.’
“看在我的份上，不要发生事故——因为我对水负责。”

‘Sure,’ pledged Gudrun.
“当然，”古德伦保证道。

‘Besides, we can both swim quite well,’ said Ursula.
“此外，我们都游得很好，”乌苏拉说。

‘Well—then I’ll get them to put you up a tea-basket, and you can picnic all to yourselves,—that’s the idea, isn’t it?’
“好吧——那我就让他们给你准备一个茶篮，这样你就可以自己去野餐了——就是这个主意，不是吗？”

‘How fearfully good! How frightfully nice if you could!’ cried Gudrun warmly, her colour flushing up again. It made the blood stir in his veins, the subtle way she turned to him and infused her gratitude into his body.
‘多好啊！如果你能做到的话，那该多好啊！”古珍热情地喊道，她的脸色又涨红了。她转向他并将感激之情注入他的身体的微妙方式让他的血管里的血液沸腾起来。

‘Where’s Birkin?’ he said, his eyes twinkling. ‘He might help me to get it down.’
“伯金在哪儿？”他说道，眼睛里闪烁着光芒。 “他可能会帮我把它记下来。”

‘But what about your hand? Isn’t it hurt?’ asked Gudrun, rather muted, as if avoiding the intimacy. This was the first time the hurt had been mentioned. The curious way she skirted round the subject sent a new, subtle caress through his veins. He took his hand out of his pocket. It was bandaged. He looked at it, then put it in his pocket again. Gudrun quivered at the sight of the wrapped up paw.
‘但是你的手呢？没有受伤吗？”古德伦问道，声音相当小声，仿佛在回避这种亲密关系。这是第一次提到伤害。她绕开这个话题的奇怪方式给他的血管带来了一种新的、微妙的爱抚。他把手从口袋里拿出来。它被绷带缠住了。他看了一眼，然后又把它放进了口袋里。古德伦看到包裹着的爪子，浑身颤抖。

‘Oh I can manage with one hand. The canoe is as light as a feather,’ he said. ‘There’s Rupert!—Rupert!’
‘噢，我一只手就能搞定。独木舟轻如羽毛，”他说。 “鲁珀特在那儿！——鲁珀特！”

Birkin turned from his social duties and came towards them.
伯金放弃了他的社会职责，走向了他们。

‘What have you done to it?’ asked Ursula, who had been aching to put the question for the last half hour.
“你对它做了什么？”乌苏拉问道，她在过去的半个小时里一直渴望提出这个问题。

‘To my hand?’ said Gerald. ‘I trapped it in some machinery.’
“到我手上？”杰拉尔德说。 “我把它困在一些机器里了。”

‘Ugh!’ said Ursula. ‘And did it hurt much?’
“呃！”乌苏拉说。 “疼得很厉害吗？”

‘Yes,’ he said. ‘It did at the time. It’s getting better now. It crushed the fingers.’
“是的，”他说。 ‘当时确实如此。现在好多了。它压碎了手指。”

‘Oh,’ cried Ursula, as if in pain, ‘I hate people who hurt themselves. I can FEEL it.’ And she shook her hand.
“哦，”乌苏拉喊道，仿佛很痛苦，“我讨厌那些伤害自己的人。我能感觉到。”然后她握了握手。

‘What do you want?’ said Birkin.
“你想要什么？”伯金说。

The two men carried down the slim brown boat, and set it on the water.
两个人把那条细长的棕色小船抬了下来，放在水面上。

‘You’re quite sure you’ll be safe in it?’ Gerald asked.
“你确信你在里面会安全吗？”杰拉尔德问。

‘Quite sure,’ said Gudrun. ‘I wouldn’t be so mean as to take it, if there was the slightest doubt. But I’ve had a canoe at Arundel, and I assure you I’m perfectly safe.’
“非常肯定，”古德伦说。 “如果有丝毫疑问，我不会吝啬地接受它。但我在阿伦德尔有一艘独木舟，我向你保证我非常安全。

So saying, having given her word like a man, she and Ursula entered the frail craft, and pushed gently off. The two men stood watching them. Gudrun was paddling. She knew the men were watching her, and it made her slow and rather clumsy. The colour flew in her face like a flag.
说着，她像个男人一样下了诺言，然后和乌苏拉进入脆弱的飞船，轻轻地推开。两个人站在那儿看着他们。古德伦正在划桨。她知道男人们在注视着她，这让她动作缓慢且相当笨拙。颜色像一面旗帜一样飘扬在她的脸上。

‘Thanks awfully,’ she called back to him, from the water, as the boat slid away. ‘It’s lovely—like sitting in a leaf.’
“非常感谢，”当船驶离时，她在水中对他喊道。 “这很可爱——就像坐在树叶上一样。”

He laughed at the fancy. Her voice was shrill and strange, calling from the distance. He watched her as she paddled away. There was something childlike about her, trustful and deferential, like a child. He watched her all the while, as she rowed. And to Gudrun it was a real delight, in make-belief, to be the childlike, clinging woman to the man who stood there on the quay, so good-looking and efficient in his white clothes, and moreover the most important man she knew at the moment. She did not take any notice of the wavering, indistinct, lambent Birkin, who stood at his side. One figure at a time occupied the field of her attention.
他嘲笑这种幻想。她的声音尖锐而陌生，从远处传来。他看着她划桨离开。她身上有一种孩子气，信任和恭顺，就像一个孩子。当她划船时，他一直看着她。对于古德伦来说，在码头上站着的那个男人面前，他是一个孩子气的、粘人的女人，他穿着白衣服那么英俊、那么有效率，而且还是她认识的最重要的男人，这真是一种快乐，虚拟的。眼下。她没有注意到站在他身边的那个摇摆不定、模模糊糊、表情忧郁的伯金。一次有一个人影占据了她的注意力。

The boat rustled lightly along the water. They passed the bathers whose striped tents stood between the willows of the meadow’s edge, and drew along the open shore, past the meadows that sloped golden in the light of the already late afternoon. Other boats were stealing under the wooded shore opposite, they could hear people’s laughter and voices. But Gudrun rowed on towards the clump of trees that balanced perfect in the distance, in the golden light.
小船在水面上轻轻地行驶着。他们经过了沐浴者，他们的条纹帐篷矗立在草地边缘的柳树之间，然后沿着开阔的海岸行驶，经过在已经傍晚的阳光下倾斜的金色草地。其他船只在对面树木繁茂的岸边偷偷行驶，他们可以听到人们的笑声和说话声。但古德伦继续划向远处那片在金色光芒中完美平衡的树丛。

The sisters found a little place where a tiny stream flowed into the lake, with reeds and flowery marsh of pink willow herb, and a gravelly bank to the side. Here they ran delicately ashore, with their frail boat, the two girls took off their shoes and stockings and went through the water’s edge to the grass. The tiny ripples of the lake were warm and clear, they lifted their boat on to the bank, and looked round with joy. They were quite alone in a forsaken little stream-mouth, and on the knoll just behind was the clump of trees.
姐妹俩找到了一个小地方，有一条小溪流入湖中，那里长满了芦苇和长满粉红色柳草的花朵沼泽，旁边还有一条砾石岸。在这里，她们小心翼翼地跑上岸，两个女孩驾着脆弱的小船，脱掉鞋子和袜子，穿过水边，来到草地上。湖水泛起细小的涟漪，温暖而清澈，他们把小船举到岸边，高兴地环顾四周。他们孤零零地待在一个废弃的小溪口里，后面的小山丘上有一片树林。

‘We will bathe just for a moment,’ said Ursula, ‘and then we’ll have tea.’
“我们先洗一会儿澡，”乌苏拉说，“然后我们就喝茶。”

They looked round. Nobody could notice them, or could come up in time to see them. In less than a minute Ursula had thrown off her clothes and had slipped naked into the water, and was swimming out. Quickly, Gudrun joined her. They swam silently and blissfully for a few minutes, circling round their little stream-mouth. Then they slipped ashore and ran into the grove again, like nymphs.
他们环顾四周。没有人能够注意到他们，或者能够及时出现看到他们。不到一分钟，乌苏拉就脱掉了衣服，赤身裸体地滑入水中，然后游了出去。很快，古德伦就加入了她。它们绕着小河口静静地、幸福地游了几分钟。然后他们就溜上岸，又像仙女一样跑进树林里。

‘How lovely it is to be free,’ said Ursula, running swiftly here and there between the tree trunks, quite naked, her hair blowing loose. The grove was of beech-trees, big and splendid, a steel-grey scaffolding of trunks and boughs, with level sprays of strong green here and there, whilst through the northern side the distance glimmered open as through a window.
“自由是多么美好啊，”乌苏拉一边说，一边在树干间飞快地跑来跑去，全身赤裸，头发随风飘散。树林里长满了山毛榉树，又大又漂亮，树干和树枝组成了钢灰色的脚手架，到处都有浓浓的绿色喷雾，而透过北侧，远方像透过窗户一样闪闪发光。

When they had run and danced themselves dry, the girls quickly dressed and sat down to the fragrant tea. They sat on the northern side of the grove, in the yellow sunshine facing the slope of the grassy hill, alone in a little wild world of their own. The tea was hot and aromatic, there were delicious little sandwiches of cucumber and of caviare, and winy cakes.
当她们跑完舞后，姑娘们赶紧穿好衣服，坐下来喝香茶。他们坐在小树林的北侧，沐浴在黄色的阳光下，面对着草山的斜坡，独自一人在自己的小小野生世界里。茶又热又香，还有美味的黄瓜和鱼子酱小三明治，还有葡萄酒蛋糕。

‘Are you happy, Prune?’ cried Ursula in delight, looking at her sister.
“普鲁，你幸福吗？”乌苏拉看着她的妹妹，高兴地喊道。

‘Ursula, I’m perfectly happy,’ replied Gudrun gravely, looking at the westering sun.
“乌苏拉，我非常高兴。”古珍看着西落的太阳，严肃地回答道。

‘So am I.’
'我也是。'

When they were together, doing the things they enjoyed, the two sisters were quite complete in a perfect world of their own. And this was one of the perfect moments of freedom and delight, such as children alone know, when all seems a perfect and blissful adventure.
当她们在一起做她们喜欢的事情时，两姐妹在她们自己的完美世界中非常完整。这是自由和快乐的完美时刻之一，只有孩子们知道，一切似乎都是完美而幸福的冒险。

When they had finished tea, the two girls sat on, silent and serene. Then Ursula, who had a beautiful strong voice, began to sing to herself, softly: ‘Annchen von Tharau.’ Gudrun listened, as she sat beneath the trees, and the yearning came into her heart. Ursula seemed so peaceful and sufficient unto herself, sitting there unconsciously crooning her song, strong and unquestioned at the centre of her own universe. And Gudrun felt herself outside. Always this desolating, agonised feeling, that she was outside of life, an onlooker, whilst Ursula was a partaker, caused Gudrun to suffer from a sense of her own negation, and made her, that she must always demand the other to be aware of her, to be in connection with her.
喝完茶后，两个女孩静静地坐着。然后乌苏拉，她有着美丽而有力的声音，开始轻柔地自言自语：“安臣·冯·塔劳。”古德伦坐在树下听着，渴望涌上心头。乌苏拉似乎对自己如此平静和足够，无意识地坐在那里低吟着她的歌，在她自己的宇宙中心坚强而不容置疑。古珍感觉自己在外面。总是有这种荒凉、痛苦的感觉，她是生活之外的旁观者，而乌苏拉却是生活的参与者，这让古德伦感到自己被否定了，她必须总是要求对方意识到这一点。她，与她有联系。

‘Do you mind if I do Dalcroze to that tune, Hurtler?’ she asked in a curious muted tone, scarce moving her lips.
“赫特勒，你介意我用达尔克罗兹的曲调来演奏吗？”她用一种奇怪的、柔和的语气问道，嘴唇几乎没有动。

‘What did you say?’ asked Ursula, looking up in peaceful surprise.
“你说什么？”乌苏拉问道，抬起头，平静而惊讶。

‘Will you sing while I do Dalcroze?’ said Gudrun, suffering at having to repeat herself.
“我表演达尔克罗兹的时候你能唱歌吗？”古德伦说道，因为不得不重复自己的话而感到痛苦。

Ursula thought a moment, gathering her straying wits together.
乌苏拉想了一会儿，集中了她的思绪。

‘While you do—?’ she asked vaguely.
“而你却——？”她含糊地问道。

‘Dalcroze movements,’ said Gudrun, suffering tortures of self-consciousness, even because of her sister.
“达尔克罗兹的动作，”古德伦说，即使是因为她的妹妹，她也遭受着自我意识的折磨。

‘Oh Dalcroze! I couldn’t catch the name. DO—I should love to see you,’ cried Ursula, with childish surprised brightness. ‘What shall I sing?’
“噢，达尔克罗兹！我听不清这个名字。做——我很高兴见到你，”乌苏拉大声喊道，脸上带着孩子气的惊讶的光芒。 “我该唱什么歌呢？”

‘Sing anything you like, and I’ll take the rhythm from it.’
“唱任何你喜欢的歌，我都会从中吸取节奏。”

But Ursula could not for her life think of anything to sing. However, she suddenly began, in a laughing, teasing voice:
但乌苏拉一生想不出有什么可以唱的。然而，她突然用一种带着笑意、戏谑的声音说道：

‘My love—is a high-born lady—‘
“我的爱人——是一位出身高贵的女士——”

Gudrun, looking as if some invisible chain weighed on her hands and feet, began slowly to dance in the eurythmic manner, pulsing and fluttering rhythmically with her feet, making slower, regular gestures with her hands and arms, now spreading her arms wide, now raising them above her head, now flinging them softly apart, and lifting her face, her feet all the time beating and running to the measure of the song, as if it were some strange incantation, her white, rapt form drifting here and there in a strange impulsive rhapsody, seeming to be lifted on a breeze of incantation, shuddering with strange little runs. Ursula sat on the grass, her mouth open in her singing, her eyes laughing as if she thought it was a great joke, but a yellow light flashing up in them, as she caught some of the unconscious ritualistic suggestion of the complex shuddering and waving and drifting of her sister’s white form, that was clutched in pure, mindless, tossing rhythm, and a will set powerful in a kind of hypnotic influence.
古德伦看起来好像有一条无形的链条压在她的手脚上，她开始以有节奏的方式慢慢地跳舞，她的脚有节奏地脉动和颤动，她的手和手臂做出缓慢而有规律的手势，现在张开双臂，现在她把它们举过头顶，现在轻轻地把它们分开，然后抬起脸，她的脚一直在随着歌曲的节拍而跳动，仿佛这是某种奇怪的咒语，她白色的、全神贯注的身形在周围飘来飘去。一种奇怪的冲动狂想曲，似乎被咒语的微风吹起，随着奇怪的小跑而颤抖。乌苏拉坐在草地上，张着嘴唱歌，眼睛里笑着，好像她认为这是一个天大的笑话，但当她捕捉到复杂的颤抖和挥舞的无意识仪式暗示时，眼中闪烁着黄色的光芒。她姐姐白色的身躯在飘荡，她的身躯被纯粹、无意识、摇摆的节奏所紧紧抓住，意志在一种催眠的影响力中发挥着强大的作用。

‘My love is a high-born lady—She is-s-s—rather dark than shady—‘ rang out Ursula’s laughing, satiric song, and quicker, fiercer went Gudrun in the dance, stamping as if she were trying to throw off some bond, flinging her hands suddenly and stamping again, then rushing with face uplifted and throat full and beautiful, and eyes half closed, sightless. The sun was low and yellow, sinking down, and in the sky floated a thin, ineffectual moon.
“我的爱人是一位出身高贵的女士——她是——斯——斯——与其说是阴暗，不如说是阴暗——”乌苏拉的讽刺歌曲响起，古德伦在舞蹈中跳得更快、更猛烈，她跺着脚，好像在试图挣脱某种束缚。 ，突然双手一甩，再次跺脚，然后昂首冲去，喉咙饱满而美丽，眼睛半闭，什么也看不见。太阳很低，呈黄色，正在沉下去，天空中漂浮着一轮薄薄的、无力的月亮。

Ursula was quite absorbed in her song, when suddenly Gudrun stopped and said mildly, ironically:
乌苏拉全神贯注地沉浸在她的歌声中，突然古德伦停了下来，温和而讽刺地说道：

‘Ursula!’
“乌苏拉！”

‘Yes?’ said Ursula, opening her eyes out of the trance.
“是吗？”乌苏拉从恍惚中睁开眼睛说道。

Gudrun was standing still and pointing, a mocking smile on her face, towards the side.
古德伦一动不动地站着，脸上带着嘲讽的微笑，指着旁边。

‘Ugh!’ cried Ursula in sudden panic, starting to her feet.
“啊！”乌苏拉突然惊慌失措地喊道，站了起来。

‘They’re quite all right,’ rang out Gudrun’s sardonic voice.
“他们很好，”古德伦冷嘲热讽的声音响起。

On the left stood a little cluster of Highland cattle, vividly coloured and fleecy in the evening light, their horns branching into the sky, pushing forward their muzzles inquisitively, to know what it was all about. Their eyes glittered through their tangle of hair, their naked nostrils were full of shadow.
左边站着一小群高地牛，在傍晚的灯光下，它们的颜色鲜艳，毛茸茸的，它们的角伸向天空，好奇地向前推着它们的口鼻，想知道这到底是怎么回事。他们的眼睛透过乱糟糟的头发闪闪发亮，裸露的鼻孔里充满了阴影。

‘Won’t they do anything?’ cried Ursula in fear.
“他们不会采取任何行动吗？”乌苏拉害怕地喊道。

Gudrun, who was usually frightened of cattle, now shook her head in a queer, half-doubtful, half-sardonic motion, a faint smile round her mouth.
古珍一向害怕牛，现在却用一种奇怪的、半怀疑半讽刺的动作摇着头，嘴角挂着淡淡的微笑。

‘Don’t they look charming, Ursula?’ cried Gudrun, in a high, strident voice, something like the scream of a seagull.
“乌苏拉，它们看起来不迷人吗？”古德伦大声喊道，声音高亢刺耳，有点像海鸥的叫声。

‘Charming,’ cried Ursula in trepidation. ‘But won’t they do anything to us?’
“迷人，”乌苏拉惊恐地喊道。 “但是他们不会对我们做什么吗？”

Again Gudrun looked back at her sister with an enigmatic smile, and shook her head.
古珍再次带着神秘的微笑回头看着她的妹妹，然后摇了摇头。

‘I’m sure they won’t,’ she said, as if she had to convince herself also, and yet, as if she were confident of some secret power in herself, and had to put it to the test. ‘Sit down and sing again,’ she called in her high, strident voice.
“我确信他们不会，”她说道，仿佛她也必须说服自己，然而，又好像她对自己体内的某种秘密力量充满信心，并且必须对其进行考验。 “坐下来再唱吧，”她用高亢刺耳的声音喊道。

‘I’m frightened,’ cried Ursula, in a pathetic voice, watching the group of sturdy short cattle, that stood with their knees planted, and watched with their dark, wicked eyes, through the matted fringe of their hair. Nevertheless, she sank down again, in her former posture.
“我害怕了，”乌苏拉用可怜的声音喊道，她注视着那群壮实的短牛，它们双膝着地，用黑色、邪恶的眼睛透过乱蓬蓬的发髻注视着。然而，她又恢复了原来的姿势。

‘They are quite safe,’ came Gudrun’s high call. ‘Sing something, you’ve only to sing something.’
“他们很安全，”古德伦高声喊道。 “唱点什么，你只需唱点什么。”

It was evident she had a strange passion to dance before the sturdy, handsome cattle.
很明显，她对在强壮、英俊的牛群面前跳舞有一种奇怪的热情。

Ursula began to sing, in a false quavering voice:
乌苏拉开始用颤抖的声音唱道：

‘Way down in Tennessee—‘
“在田纳西州很远的地方——”

She sounded purely anxious. Nevertheless, Gudrun, with her arms outspread and her face uplifted, went in a strange palpitating dance towards the cattle, lifting her body towards them as if in a spell, her feet pulsing as if in some little frenzy of unconscious sensation, her arms, her wrists, her hands stretching and heaving and falling and reaching and reaching and falling, her breasts lifted and shaken towards the cattle, her throat exposed as in some voluptuous ecstasy towards them, whilst she drifted imperceptibly nearer, an uncanny white figure, towards them, carried away in its own rapt trance, ebbing in strange fluctuations upon the cattle, that waited, and ducked their heads a little in sudden contraction from her, watching all the time as if hypnotised, their bare horns branching in the clear light, as the white figure of the woman ebbed upon them, in the slow, hypnotising convulsion of the dance. She could feel them just in front of her, it was as if she had the electric pulse from their breasts running into her hands. Soon she would touch them, actually touch them. A terrible shiver of fear and pleasure went through her. And all the while, Ursula, spell-bound, kept up her high-pitched thin, irrelevant song, which pierced the fading evening like an incantation.
她听起来纯粹是焦虑。尽管如此，古德伦张开双臂，仰起脸，以一种奇怪的、令人心悸的舞蹈向牛群走去，她像施了咒语一样向它们抬起身体，她的脚在搏动，仿佛处于某种无意识的感觉的疯狂中，她的手臂，她的手腕，她的手伸展、起伏、落下、伸手、伸手、落下，她的乳房向牛群抬起、摇晃，她的喉咙暴露在外，仿佛对它们感到某种性感的狂喜，而她，一个不可思议的白色身影，不知不觉地向它们靠近了一些。 ，在它自己的全神贯注的恍惚中，在等待的牛身上奇怪的波动中消退，在突然的收缩中稍微低下头，仿佛被催眠了，它们裸露的角在清晰的光线下分叉，就像那个女人的白色身影在缓慢的、令人着迷的舞蹈抽搐中逐渐向他们走来。她能感觉到他们就在她面前，就好像他们乳房的电脉冲流到了她的手上。很快她就会触摸它们，真正地触摸它们。恐惧和快乐交织在一起，她浑身一阵颤抖。乌苏拉始终如痴如醉，一直唱着她高亢、单调、无关紧要的歌曲，这首歌像咒语一样刺穿了渐渐消逝的夜晚。

Gudrun could hear the cattle breathing heavily with helpless fear and fascination. Oh, they were brave little beasts, these wild Scotch bullocks, wild and fleecy. Suddenly one of them snorted, ducked its head, and backed.
古德伦听见牛群粗重的呼吸声，带着无助的恐惧和着迷。哦，它们是勇敢的小野兽，这些野生苏格兰公牛，狂野而毛茸茸的。突然，其中一人哼了一声，低下头，向后退去。

‘Hue! Hi-eee!’ came a sudden loud shout from the edge of the grove. The cattle broke and fell back quite spontaneously, went running up the hill, their fleece waving like fire to their motion. Gudrun stood suspended out on the grass, Ursula rose to her feet.
'色调！嗨——哎呀！”树林边缘突然传来一声大声喊叫。牛群自发地折断并向后倒去，跑上山，它们的羊毛像火一样随着它们的动作而飘动。古德伦悬浮在草地上，乌苏拉站了起来。

It was Gerald and Birkin come to find them, and Gerald had cried out to frighten off the cattle.
杰拉德和伯金来找他们，杰拉德大声喊叫，吓跑了牛群。

‘What do you think you’re doing?’ he now called, in a high, wondering vexed tone.
“你认为你在做什么？”他用高亢、疑惑、恼火的语气喊道。

‘Why have you come?’ came back Gudrun’s strident cry of anger.
“你为什么来？”古德伦愤怒地大声喊道。

‘What do you think you were doing?’ Gerald repeated, auto-matically.
“你认为你在做什么？”杰拉德不假思索地重复道。

‘We were doing eurythmics,’ laughed Ursula, in a shaken voice.
“我们在做韵律舞，”乌苏拉笑着说，声音颤抖着。

Gudrun stood aloof looking at them with large dark eyes of resentment, suspended for a few moments. Then she walked away up the hill, after the cattle, which had gathered in a little, spell-bound cluster higher up.
古珍冷漠地站着，用充满怨恨的大黑眼睛看着他们，停顿了一会儿。然后，她跟着牛群走上了山，牛群聚集在高处，被施了魔法，聚集成一小群。

‘Where are you going?’ Gerald called after her. And he followed her up the hill-side. The sun had gone behind the hill, and shadows were clinging to the earth, the sky above was full of travelling light.
“你要去哪儿？”杰拉德在她身后喊道。他跟着她上了山坡。太阳已经落到山后，阴影附着在大地上，头顶的天空充满了行进的光芒。

‘A poor song for a dance,’ said Birkin to Ursula, standing before her with a sardonic, flickering laugh on his face. And in another second, he was singing softly to himself, and dancing a grotesque step-dance in front of her, his limbs and body shaking loose, his face flickering palely, a constant thing, whilst his feet beat a rapid mocking tattoo, and his body seemed to hang all loose and quaking in between, like a shadow.
“一首糟糕的舞曲，”伯金站在乌苏拉面前，脸上挂着讽刺的笑声，对她说。又过了一秒，他轻声自言自语，在她面前跳起了怪诞的踢踏舞，他的四肢和身体松散地颤抖着，他的脸色不断地闪烁着苍白，而他的脚快速地踢着嘲讽的纹身，他的身体似乎松松垮垮地悬在中间，像影子一样颤抖着。

‘I think we’ve all gone mad,’ she said, laughing rather frightened.
“我想我们都疯了，”她笑着说道，显得有些害怕。

‘Pity we aren’t madder,’ he answered, as he kept up the incessant shaking dance. Then suddenly he leaned up to her and kissed her fingers lightly, putting his face to hers and looking into her eyes with a pale grin. She stepped back, affronted.
“可惜我们没有更疯狂，”他回答道，同时继续不停地颤抖着舞蹈。然后突然他靠向她，轻轻地吻了一下她的手指，把脸贴在她的脸上，带着苍白的笑容看着她的眼睛。她被冒犯了，后退了一步。

‘Offended—?’ he asked ironically, suddenly going quite still and reserved again. ‘I thought you liked the light fantastic.’
“被冒犯了——？”他讽刺地问道，突然变得一动不动，又有所保留。 “我以为你很喜欢这里的光线。”

‘Not like that,’ she said, confused and bewildered, almost affronted. Yet somewhere inside her she was fascinated by the sight of his loose, vibrating body, perfectly abandoned to its own dropping and swinging, and by the pallid, sardonic-smiling face above. Yet automatically she stiffened herself away, and disapproved. It seemed almost an obscenity, in a man who talked as a rule so very seriously.
“不是那样的，”她说，感到困惑和困惑，几乎被冒犯了。然而，她内心的某个地方，却着迷于他松散、颤动的身体，完全被自己的下落和摆动所抛弃，还有上面那张苍白、讽刺的微笑的脸。但她不由自主地僵硬起来，表示不同意。对于一个平时说话非常严肃的人来说，这几乎是一种猥亵。

‘Why not like that?’ he mocked. And immediately he dropped again into the incredibly rapid, slack-waggling dance, watching her malevolently. And moving in the rapid, stationary dance, he came a little nearer, and reached forward with an incredibly mocking, satiric gleam on his face, and would have kissed her again, had she not started back.
“为什么不那样呢？”他嘲笑道。他立刻又跳起了那令人难以置信的快速、慵懒的舞蹈，恶毒地看着她。他以快速、静止的舞蹈移动着，靠近了一点，向前伸出手，脸上闪着令人难以置信的嘲讽和讽刺的光芒，如果她没有向后退一步，他会再次吻她。

‘No, don’t!’ she cried, really afraid.
“不，不要！”她大声喊道，非常害怕。

‘Cordelia after all,’ he said satirically. She was stung, as if this were an insult. She knew he intended it as such, and it bewildered her.
“毕竟是科迪莉亚，”他讽刺地说。她被蜇了，仿佛这是一种侮辱。她知道他是这么想的，这让她很困惑。

‘And you,’ she cried in retort, ‘why do you always take your soul in your mouth, so frightfully full?’
“而你，”她反驳道，“为什么你总是把自己的灵魂含在嘴里，那么饱得可怕？”

‘So that I can spit it out the more readily,’ he said, pleased by his own retort.
“这样我就可以更容易地把它吐出来，”他说，对自己的反驳感到高兴。

Gerald Crich, his face narrowing to an intent gleam, followed up the hill with quick strides, straight after Gudrun. The cattle stood with their noses together on the brow of a slope, watching the scene below, the men in white hovering about the white forms of the women, watching above all Gudrun, who was advancing slowly towards them. She stood a moment, glancing back at Gerald, and then at the cattle.
杰拉德·克里奇的脸眯成一团专注的光芒，大步追上山，紧随古德伦身后。牛群把鼻子凑到山坡上，注视着下面的景象，白衣男人在女人的白色身躯周围盘旋，首先注视着古德伦，后者正在慢慢地向他们走来。她站了一会儿，回头看看杰拉德，然后又看看牛群。

Then in a sudden motion, she lifted her arms and rushed sheer upon the long-horned bullocks, in shuddering irregular runs, pausing for a second and looking at them, then lifting her hands and running forward with a flash, till they ceased pawing the ground, and gave way, snorting with terror, lifting their heads from the ground and flinging themselves away, galloping off into the evening, becoming tiny in the distance, and still not stopping.
然后她突然举起双臂，猛地冲向长角公牛，它们颤抖着，不规则地跑动，停顿片刻，看着它们，然后举起双手，闪电般地向前跑，直到它们不再用爪子抓地。地面上，他们屈服了，恐惧地哼了一声，把头从地上抬起来，飞奔而去，飞奔向夜色，在远处变得渺小，仍然没有停下来。

Gudrun remained staring after them, with a mask-like defiant face.
古德伦仍然盯着他们，脸上带着面具般的挑衅。

‘Why do you want to drive them mad?’ asked Gerald, coming up with her.
“你为什么要把他们逼疯？”杰拉尔德问，跟着她走来。

She took no notice of him, only averted her face from him. ‘It’s not safe, you know,’ he persisted. ‘They’re nasty, when they do turn.’
她没有理会他，只是把脸从他身上移开。 “你知道，这不安全，”他坚持道。 “当它们转身时，它们就很讨厌。”

‘Turn where? Turn away?’ she mocked loudly.
‘转向哪里？转身走开吗？”她大声嘲笑道。

‘No,’ he said, ‘turn against you.’
“不，”他说，“反对你。”

‘Turn against ME?’ she mocked.
“反对我？”她嘲笑道。

He could make nothing of this.
他对此一无所知。

‘Anyway, they gored one of the farmer’s cows to death, the other day,’ he said.
“无论如何，有一天，他们用角抵死了农夫的一头牛，”他说。

‘What do I care?’ she said.
“我关心什么？”她说。

‘I cared though,’ he replied, ‘seeing that they’re my cattle.’
“不过我很关心，”他回答道，“因为它们是我的牛。”

‘How are they yours! You haven’t swallowed them. Give me one of them now,’ she said, holding out her hand.
‘它们怎么是你的！你还没有吞下它们。现在给我一张，”她伸出手说道。

‘You know where they are,’ he said, pointing over the hill. ‘You can have one if you’d like it sent to you later on.’
“你知道他们在哪里，”他指着山那边说道。 “如果你想稍后再寄给你，你可以要一份。”

She looked at him inscrutably.
她不可思议地看着他。

‘You think I’m afraid of you and your cattle, don’t you?’ she asked.
“你认为我害怕你和你的牛，不是吗？”她问。

His eyes narrowed dangerously. There was a faint domineering smile on his face.
他的眼睛危险地眯起来。脸上带着淡淡的霸气笑容。

‘Why should I think that?’ he said.
“我为什么要这么想？”他说。

She was watching him all the time with her dark, dilated, inchoate eyes. She leaned forward and swung round her arm, catching him a light blow on the face with the back of her hand.
她一直用那双漆黑、扩张、幼稚的眼睛注视着他。她向前倾身，甩动手臂，用手背接住了他脸上的一记轻击。

‘That’s why,’ she said, mocking.
“这就是原因，”她嘲笑道。

And she felt in her soul an unconquerable desire for deep violence against him. She shut off the fear and dismay that filled her conscious mind. She wanted to do as she did, she was not going to be afraid.
她的灵魂深处有一种无法抑制的渴望，想要对他施以深深的暴力。她关闭了意识中充满的恐惧和沮丧。她想做什么就做什么，她不会害怕。

He recoiled from the slight blow on his face. He became deadly pale, and a dangerous flame darkened his eyes. For some seconds he could not speak, his lungs were so suffused with blood, his heart stretched almost to bursting with a great gush of ungovernable emotion. It was as if some reservoir of black emotion had burst within him, and swamped him.
脸上的轻微打击使他后退了一步。他的脸色变得惨白，双眸中闪烁着危险的火焰。有好几秒钟他说不出话来，他的肺部充满了血液，他的心脏几乎要爆裂，一股难以抑制的情绪涌出。仿佛某种黑色情感的蓄水池在他体内爆发，将他淹没。

‘You have struck the first blow,’ he said at last, forcing the words from his lungs, in a voice so soft and low, it sounded like a dream within her, not spoken in the outer air.
“你已经打出了第一击。”他最后说道，从肺里挤出了这句话，声音如此轻柔低沉，听起来就像是她内心的一场梦，而不是在外面的空气中说出来的。

‘And I shall strike the last,’ she retorted involuntarily, with confident assurance. He was silent, he did not contradict her.
“我会攻击最后一个，”她不由自主地反驳道，充满自信。他沉默了，没有反驳她。

She stood negligently, staring away from him, into the distance. On the edge of her consciousness the question was asking itself, automatically:
她漫不经心地站着，目光从他身上移开，望向远方。在她意识的边缘，这个问题自动地问自己：

‘Why ARE you behaving in this IMPOSSIBLE and ridiculous fashion.’ But she was sullen, she half shoved the question out of herself. She could not get it clean away, so she felt self-conscious.
“你为什么要做出这种不可能、可笑的举动。”但她很闷闷不乐，半推半就地把这个问题从自己身上推了出来。她无法把它清除干净，所以她感到不自在。

Gerald, very pale, was watching her closely. His eyes were lit up with intent lights, absorbed and gleaming. She turned suddenly on him.
杰拉尔德脸色苍白，仔细地看着她。他的眼睛被专注的光芒照亮，全神贯注，闪闪发光。她突然转向他。

‘It’s you who make me behave like this, you know,’ she said, almost suggestive.
“你知道，是你让我这么做的，”她几乎是在暗示。

‘I? How?’ he said.
'我？怎么办？”他说。

But she turned away, and set off towards the lake. Below, on the water, lanterns were coming alight, faint ghosts of warm flame floating in the pallor of the first twilight. The earth was spread with darkness, like lacquer, overhead was a pale sky, all primrose, and the lake was pale as milk in one part. Away at the landing stage, tiniest points of coloured rays were stringing themselves in the dusk. The launch was being illuminated. All round, shadow was gathering from the trees.
但她却转身，向湖边走去。下面，水面上，灯笼亮了起来，微弱的温暖火焰的幽灵漂浮在第一缕曙光的苍白中。大地一片黑暗，像漆一样，头顶是苍白的天空，全是报春花，湖水的一部分苍白得像牛奶。在远处的着陆台上，最微小的彩色光线在黄昏中串起。发射船被照亮了。四周，树荫不断聚集。

Gerald, white like a presence in his summer clothes, was following down the open grassy slope. Gudrun waited for him to come up. Then she softly put out her hand and touched him, saying softly:
杰拉德的皮肤白得像穿着夏装的存在，正沿着开阔的草坡走下去。古德伦等着他上来。然后她轻轻伸出手，触碰了他，轻声说道：

‘Don’t be angry with me.’
“别生我的气。”

A flame flew over him, and he was unconscious. Yet he stammered:
一股火焰从他身上飞过，他失去了知觉。但他却结结巴巴地说：

‘I’m not angry with you. I’m in love with you.’
'我没对你生气。我爱上了你。'

His mind was gone, he grasped for sufficient mechanical control, to save himself. She laughed a silvery little mockery, yet intolerably caressive.
他的神志已经消失，他抓住了足够的机械控制来拯救自己。她的笑声带着一丝银白色的嘲讽，但又充满了令人难以忍受的爱抚。

‘That’s one way of putting it,’ she said.
“这是一种表达方式，”她说。

The terrible swooning burden on his mind, the awful swooning, the loss of all his control, was too much for him. He grasped her arm in his one hand, as if his hand were iron.
他心里承受着可怕的昏厥负担，可怕的昏厥，失去了所有的控制，对他来说实在是太难以承受了。他一只手握住她的手臂，仿佛他的手是铁的。

‘It’s all right, then, is it?’ he said, holding her arrested.
“那么，没关系，是吗？”他一边说，一边抓住了她。

She looked at the face with the fixed eyes, set before her, and her blood ran cold.
她凝视着眼前那张脸，浑身的血液都凉了。

‘Yes, it’s all right,’ she said softly, as if drugged, her voice crooning and witch-like.
“是的，没关系，”她轻声说道，仿佛被下了药，声音低沉，像女巫。

He walked on beside her, a striding, mindless body. But he recovered a little as he went. He suffered badly. He had killed his brother when a boy, and was set apart, like Cain.
他在她身边走着，迈着大步，毫无意识地走着。但他走着走着就恢复了一些。他受尽了痛苦。他小时候杀了自己的兄弟，像该隐一样被孤立。

They found Birkin and Ursula sitting together by the boats, talking and laughing. Birkin had been teasing Ursula.
他们发现伯金和乌苏拉坐在船边有说有笑。伯金一直在取笑乌苏拉。

‘Do you smell this little marsh?’ he said, sniffing the air. He was very sensitive to scents, and quick in understanding them.
“你闻到这片小沼泽的味道了吗？”他闻着空气说道。他对气味非常敏感，并且很快就能理解它们。

‘It’s rather nice,’ she said.
“这相当不错，”她说。

‘No,’ he replied, ‘alarming.’
“不，”他回答道，“令人震惊。”

‘Why alarming?’ she laughed.
“为什么令人担忧？”她笑道。

‘It seethes and seethes, a river of darkness,’ he said, ‘putting forth lilies and snakes, and the ignis fatuus, and rolling all the time onward. That’s what we never take into count—that it rolls onwards.’
“它沸腾了，沸腾了，一条黑暗之河，”他说，“喷出百合花、蛇和火火，一直向前滚动。”这是我们从未考虑过的——它会继续向前发展。

‘What does?’
“有什么作用？”

‘The other river, the black river. We always consider the silver river of life, rolling on and quickening all the world to a brightness, on and on to heaven, flowing into a bright eternal sea, a heaven of angels thronging. But the other is our real reality—‘
‘另一条河，黑河。我们总是想象生命的银色河流，滚滚而过，使整个世界变得明亮，一直流向天堂，流入明亮永恒的海洋，天使聚集的天堂。但另一个是我们的真实现实——”

‘But what other? I don’t see any other,’ said Ursula.
‘但是还有什么？我没有看到其他的，”乌苏拉说。

‘It is your reality, nevertheless,’ he said; ‘that dark river of dissolution. You see it rolls in us just as the other rolls—the black river of corruption. And our flowers are of this—our sea-born Aphrodite, all our white phosphorescent flowers of sensuous perfection, all our reality, nowadays.’
“无论如何，这就是你的现实，”他说。 ‘那条黑暗的溶解之河。你会看到它在我们体内滚动，就像其他东西在我们体内滚动一样——腐败的黑色河流。我们的花就是这样的——我们的海洋出生的阿芙罗狄蒂，我们所有感性完美的白色磷光花，我们现在所有的现实。

‘You mean that Aphrodite is really deathly?’ asked Ursula.
“你的意思是阿芙罗狄蒂真的是致命的？”乌苏拉问道。

‘I mean she is the flowering mystery of the death-process, yes,’ he replied. ‘When the stream of synthetic creation lapses, we find ourselves part of the inverse process, the blood of destructive creation. Aphrodite is born in the first spasm of universal dissolution—then the snakes and swans and lotus—marsh-flowers—and Gudrun and Gerald—born in the process of destructive creation.’
“我的意思是，她是死亡过程中盛开的谜团，是的，”他回答道。 “当合成创造之流消失时，我们发现自己成为了逆过程的一部分，即破坏性创造的血液。阿佛洛狄忒诞生于宇宙解体的第一次痉挛中——然后是蛇、天鹅和莲花——沼泽花——以及古德伦和杰拉德——诞生于毁灭性创造的过程中。

‘And you and me—?’ she asked.
“那你和我——？”她问道。

‘Probably,’ he replied. ‘In part, certainly. Whether we are that, in toto, I don’t yet know.’
“可能，”他回答道。 “当然，部分是这样。总的来说，我还不知道我们是否是那样。

‘You mean we are flowers of dissolution—fleurs du mal? I don’t feel as if I were,’ she protested.
“你的意思是我们是消散之花——Fleurs du mal？” “我不觉得自己是这样的，”她抗议道。

He was silent for a time.
他沉默了一会儿。

‘I don’t feel as if we were, ALTOGETHER,’ he replied. ‘Some people are pure flowers of dark corruption—lilies. But there ought to be some roses, warm and flamy. You know Herakleitos says ‘a dry soul is best.’ I know so well what that means. Do you?’
“我不觉得我们在一起，”他回答道。 “有些人是黑暗腐败的纯粹之花——百合花。”但应该有一些玫瑰，温暖而火热。你知道赫拉克莱托斯说“干燥的灵魂是最好的”。我很清楚这意味着什么。你？'

‘I’m not sure,’ Ursula replied. ‘But what if people ARE all flowers of dissolution—when they’re flowers at all—what difference does it make?’
“我不确定，”乌苏拉回答道。 “但是，如果人们都是消散之花——当他们根本就是花朵时——那会有什么不同呢？”

‘No difference—and all the difference. Dissolution rolls on, just as production does,’ he said. ‘It is a progressive process—and it ends in universal nothing—the end of the world, if you like. But why isn’t the end of the world as good as the beginning?’
“没有什么区别——而且是完全不同。”就像生产一样，解散也在继续，”他说。 “这是一个渐进的过程——如果你愿意的话，它会以普遍的虚无告终——世界末日。但为什么世界末日不如开始呢？

‘I suppose it isn’t,’ said Ursula, rather angry.
“我想不是，”乌苏拉相当生气地说。

‘Oh yes, ultimately,’ he said. ‘It means a new cycle of creation after—but not for us. If it is the end, then we are of the end—fleurs du mal if you like. If we are fleurs du mal, we are not roses of happiness, and there you are.’
“哦，是的，最终，”他说。 “这意味着之后的一个新的创造周期——但对我们来说不是。”如果这是终结，那么我们就到了终结——如果你愿意的话，那就是“Fleurs du mal”。如果我们是恶之花，我们就不是幸福的玫瑰，而你就是这样。”

‘But I think I am,’ said Ursula. ‘I think I am a rose of happiness.’
“但我想我是，”乌苏拉说。 “我想我是一朵幸福的玫瑰。”

‘Ready-made?’ he asked ironically.
“现成的？”他讽刺地问道。

‘No—real,’ she said, hurt.
“不——是真的，”她受伤地说。

‘If we are the end, we are not the beginning,’ he said.
“如果我们是终结，那么我们就不是开始，”他说。

‘Yes we are,’ she said. ‘The beginning comes out of the end.’
“是的，我们是，”她说。 “开始源于结束。”

‘After it, not out of it. After us, not out of us.’
‘在它之后，而不是在它之外。在我们之后，而不是在我们之外。

‘You are a devil, you know, really,’ she said. ‘You want to destroy our hope. You WANT US to be deathly.’
“你是一个魔鬼，你知道，真的，”她说。 ‘你想摧毁我们的希望。你希望我们死去。

‘No,’ he said, ‘I only want us to KNOW what we are.’
“不，”他说，“我只想让我们知道我们是什么。”

‘Ha!’ she cried in anger. ‘You only want us to know death.’
“哈！”她愤怒地叫道。 “你只想让我们知道死亡。”

‘You’re quite right,’ said the soft voice of Gerald, out of the dusk behind.
“你说得很对，”杰拉尔德柔和的声音从身后的暮色中传来。

Birkin rose. Gerald and Gudrun came up. They all began to smoke, in the moments of silence. One after another, Birkin lighted their cigarettes. The match flickered in the twilight, and they were all smoking peacefully by the water-side. The lake was dim, the light dying from off it, in the midst of the dark land. The air all round was intangible, neither here nor there, and there was an unreal noise of banjoes, or suchlike music.
柏金玫瑰。杰拉尔德和古德伦走了过来。在沉默的时刻，他们都开始抽烟。伯金依次点燃了香烟。火柴在暮色中闪烁，他们都在水边安静地抽烟。湖水昏暗，湖面的光芒在黑暗的大地上渐渐消失。周围的空气都是无形的，无论是这里还是那里，都传来班卓琴或类似音乐的不真实的噪音。

As the golden swim of light overhead died out, the moon gained brightness, and seemed to begin to smile forth her ascendancy. The dark woods on the opposite shore melted into universal shadow. And amid this universal under-shadow, there was a scattered intrusion of lights. Far down the lake were fantastic pale strings of colour, like beads of wan fire, green and red and yellow. The music came out in a little puff, as the launch, all illuminated, veered into the great shadow, stirring her outlines of half-living lights, puffing out her music in little drifts.
当头顶上金色的光芒消失后，月亮变得明亮起来，似乎开始微笑着宣告她的升起。对岸的黑暗树林融化成普遍的阴影。而在这普遍的阴影之中，有零散的光芒侵入。湖的深处有一道道奇妙的淡色线，就像苍白的火珠，有绿色、红色和黄色。音乐轻轻地吹了出来，因为汽艇，全部被照亮，转向巨大的阴影，搅拌着她半活的灯光的轮廓，一点点地吹出她的音乐。

All were lighting up. Here and there, close against the faint water, and at the far end of the lake, where the water lay milky in the last whiteness of the sky, and there was no shadow, solitary, frail flames of lanterns floated from the unseen boats. There was a sound of oars, and a boat passed from the pallor into the darkness under the wood, where her lanterns seemed to kindle into fire, hanging in ruddy lovely globes. And again, in the lake, shadowy red gleams hovered in reflection about the boat. Everywhere were these noiseless ruddy creatures of fire drifting near the surface of the water, caught at by the rarest, scarce visible reflections.
一切都亮了起来。到处都是，紧挨着淡淡的水，在湖的尽头，那里的水在最后一片白色的天空中呈乳白色，没有影子，孤独的、脆弱的灯火从看不见的船上漂浮着。传来桨声，一艘船从苍白的地方驶入树林下的黑暗，那里的灯笼似乎点燃了火，挂在红润可爱的球体上。湖水中，小船的倒影再次闪烁着暗红色的光芒。到处都是这些无声无息、红润的火焰生物，它们在水面附近漂流，被最罕见、稀少的可见反射所捕捉到。

Birkin brought the lanterns from the bigger boat, and the four shadowy white figures gathered round, to light them. Ursula held up the first, Birkin lowered the light from the rosy, glowing cup of his hands, into the depths of the lantern. It was kindled, and they all stood back to look at the great blue moon of light that hung from Ursula’s hand, casting a strange gleam on her face. It flickered, and Birkin went bending over the well of light. His face shone out like an apparition, so unconscious, and again, something demoniacal. Ursula was dim and veiled, looming over him.
伯金从更大的船上带来了灯笼，四个阴影般的白色人影聚集在周围，点燃灯笼。乌苏拉举起了第一个灯笼，伯金将手中的玫瑰色发光杯中的光线降低到了灯笼的深处。灯被点燃了，他们都退后一步，看着挂在乌苏拉手上的巨大的蓝色光月，在她的脸上投射出奇异的光芒。光芒闪烁，伯金弯下腰去探望光井。他的脸像幽灵一样闪闪发光，那么无意识，又像是一种恶魔般的东西。乌苏拉脸色昏暗，蒙着面纱，笼罩着他。

‘That is all right,’ said his voice softly.
“没关系，”他的声音轻柔地说。

She held up the lantern. It had a flight of storks streaming through a turquoise sky of light, over a dark earth.
她举起了灯笼。一群鹳鸟飞过碧绿的光明天空，掠过黑暗的大地。

‘This is beautiful,’ she said.
“这太漂亮了，”她说。

‘Lovely,’ echoed Gudrun, who wanted to hold one also, and lift it up full of beauty.
“可爱，”古德伦附和道，他也想握住一个，然后把它举起来，充满美丽。

‘Light one for me,’ she said. Gerald stood by her, incapacitated. Birkin lit the lantern she held up. Her heart beat with anxiety, to see how beautiful it would be. It was primrose yellow, with tall straight flowers growing darkly from their dark leaves, lifting their heads into the primrose day, while butterflies hovered about them, in the pure clear light.
“给我点一支，”她说。杰拉尔德站在她身边，无能为力。伯金点燃了她举起的灯笼。她的心焦急地跳动着，想看看那会是多么美丽。那是报春花黄色的，黑色的叶子上长着高大笔直的花朵，在报春花的日子里抬起头来，蝴蝶在它们周围盘旋，在纯净清澈的光线下。

Gudrun gave a little cry of excitement, as if pierced with delight.
古德伦兴奋地叫了一声，仿佛充满了喜悦。

‘Isn’t it beautiful, oh, isn’t it beautiful!’
“这不是很漂亮吗，哦，这不是很漂亮吗！”

Her soul was really pierced with beauty, she was translated beyond herself. Gerald leaned near to her, into her zone of light, as if to see. He came close to her, and stood touching her, looking with her at the primrose-shining globe. And she turned her face to his, that was faintly bright in the light of the lantern, and they stood together in one luminous union, close together and ringed round with light, all the rest excluded.
她的灵魂真的被美丽所刺穿，她被超越了自己。杰拉德靠向她，进入她的光域，仿佛在看什么。他靠近她，站在那里触碰她，和她一起看着那个绽放着樱草色光芒的地球仪。她把脸转向他的脸，他的脸在灯笼的光芒下显得微弱，他们站在一起，形成一个发光的联盟，紧紧地靠在一起，周围环绕着光芒，其他人都被排除在外。

Birkin looked away, and went to light Ursula’s second lantern. It had a pale ruddy sea-bottom, with black crabs and sea-weed moving sinuously under a transparent sea, that passed into flamy ruddiness above.
伯金移开视线，去点燃乌苏拉的第二个灯笼。它的海底呈淡红色，黑色的螃蟹和海藻在透明的海洋下蜿蜒移动，上面变成了火红的红色。

‘You’ve got the heavens above, and the waters under the earth,’ said Birkin to her.
伯金对她说：“上面有天堂，地下有水。”

‘Anything but the earth itself,’ she laughed, watching his live hands that hovered to attend to the light.
“除了地球本身之外的任何东西，”她笑着说，看着他那双活生生的手悬停在灯光上。

‘I’m dying to see what my second one is,’ cried Gudrun, in a vibrating rather strident voice, that seemed to repel the others from her.
“我很想知道我的第二个是什么，”古德伦喊道，声音颤抖着，声音很刺耳，这似乎让其他人远离了她。

Birkin went and kindled it. It was of a lovely deep blue colour, with a red floor, and a great white cuttle-fish flowing in white soft streams all over it. The cuttle-fish had a face that stared straight from the heart of the light, very fixed and coldly intent.
伯金走过去点燃了它。它是可爱的深蓝色，有红色的地板，一条巨大的白色墨鱼在白色柔软的溪流中游动。墨鱼的脸从光的中心直视着，非常固定，冷酷专注。

‘How truly terrifying!’ exclaimed Gudrun, in a voice of horror. Gerald, at her side, gave a low laugh.
“真是太可怕了！”古德伦惊恐地叫道。在她身边的杰拉德低声笑了一声。

‘But isn’t it really fearful!’ she cried in dismay.
“但这不是真的很可怕吗！”她沮丧地喊道。

Again he laughed, and said:
他又笑了，说道：

‘Change it with Ursula, for the crabs.’
“为了螃蟹，和乌苏拉一起换吧。”

Gudrun was silent for a moment.
古德伦沉默了一会儿。

‘Ursula,’ she said, ‘could you bear to have this fearful thing?’
“乌苏拉，”她说，“你能忍受这个可怕的东西吗？”

‘I think the colouring is LOVELY,’ said Ursula.
“我认为颜色很可爱，”乌苏拉说。

‘So do I,’ said Gudrun. ‘But could you BEAR to have it swinging to your boat? Don’t you want to destroy it at ONCE?’
“我也是，”古德伦说。 “但是你能忍受让它荡到你的船上吗？”你不想立刻毁掉它吗？

‘Oh no,’ said Ursula. ‘I don’t want to destroy it.’
“哦，不，”乌苏拉说。 “我不想毁掉它。”

‘Well do you mind having it instead of the crabs? Are you sure you don’t mind?’
“那你介意用它来代替螃蟹吗？”你确定不介意吗？

Gudrun came forward to exchange lanterns.
古珍上前交换灯笼。

‘No,’ said Ursula, yielding up the crabs and receiving the cuttle-fish.
“不，”乌苏拉说着，交出螃蟹，接过墨鱼。

Yet she could not help feeling rather resentful at the way in which Gudrun and Gerald should assume a right over her, a precedence.
然而，她不禁对古德伦和杰拉尔德对她享有优先权和优先权感到相当不满。

‘Come then,’ said Birkin. ‘I’ll put them on the boats.’
“那就来吧，”伯金说。 “我会把他们放到船上。”

He and Ursula were moving away to the big boat.
他和乌苏拉正向大船走去。

‘I suppose you’ll row me back, Rupert,’ said Gerald, out of the pale shadow of the evening.
“我想你会划船把我送回去的，鲁珀特，”杰拉德从傍晚苍白的阴影中说道。

‘Won’t you go with Gudrun in the canoe?’ said Birkin. ‘It’ll be more interesting.’
“你不和古德伦一起去划独木舟吗？”伯金说。 “这会更有趣。”

There was a moment’s pause. Birkin and Ursula stood dimly, with their swinging lanterns, by the water’s edge. The world was all illusive.
停顿了一会儿。伯金和乌苏拉提着摇晃的灯笼，昏暗地站在水边。世界都是虚幻的。

‘Is that all right?’ said Gudrun to him.
“可以吗？”古德伦对他说。

‘It’ll suit ME very well,’ he said. ‘But what about you, and the rowing? I don’t see why you should pull me.’
“它非常适合我，”他说。 “但是你和划船呢？我不明白你为什么要拉我。

‘Why not?’ she said. ‘I can pull you as well as I could pull Ursula.’
“为什么不呢？”她说。 “我可以拉动你，就像我可以拉动乌苏拉一样。”

By her tone he could tell she wanted to have him in the boat to herself, and that she was subtly gratified that she should have power over them both. He gave himself, in a strange, electric submission.
从她的语气中，他可以看出她想让他独自一人在船上，而且她对自己拥有凌驾于他们两人之上的权力感到微妙的满足。他以一种奇怪的、令人震惊的方式屈服了。

She handed him the lanterns, whilst she went to fix the cane at the end of the canoe. He followed after her, and stood with the lanterns dangling against his white-flannelled thighs, emphasising the shadow around.
她把灯笼递给他，同时去把手杖固定在独木舟的末端。他跟在她后面，站着，白色法兰绒的大腿上挂着灯笼，强调了周围的阴影。

‘Kiss me before we go,’ came his voice softly from out of the shadow above.
“走之前吻我吧。”他轻柔的声音从上方的阴影中传来。

She stopped her work in real, momentary astonishment.
她瞬间惊讶地停止了手中的工作。

‘But why?’ she exclaimed, in pure surprise.
“但是为什么呢？”她惊讶地喊道。

‘Why?’ he echoed, ironically.
“为什么？”他讽刺地重复道。

And she looked at him fixedly for some moments. Then she leaned forward and kissed him, with a slow, luxurious kiss, lingering on the mouth. And then she took the lanterns from him, while he stood swooning with the perfect fire that burned in all his joints.
她盯着他看了一会儿。然后她倾身吻了他，一个缓慢而奢华的吻，在嘴上久久挥之不去。然后她从他手中接过灯笼，而他站在那儿，全身关节都燃烧着完美的火焰，昏昏欲睡。

They lifted the canoe into the water, Gudrun took her place, and Gerald pushed off.
他们把独木舟升入水中，古德伦接替了她，杰拉尔德推开了。

‘Are you sure you don’t hurt your hand, doing that?’ she asked, solicitous. ‘Because I could have done it PERFECTLY.’
“你确定这么做不会伤到你的手吗？”她关切地问道。 “因为我本来可以做得很完美。”

‘I don’t hurt myself,’ he said in a low, soft voice, that caressed her with inexpressible beauty.
“我不会伤害自己。”他用低沉、温柔的声音说道，那声音带着难以形容的美丽抚摸着她。

And she watched him as he sat near her, very near to her, in the stern of the canoe, his legs coming towards hers, his feet touching hers. And she paddled softly, lingeringly, longing for him to say something meaningful to her. But he remained silent.
她看着他坐在独木舟的船尾，离她很近，他的腿靠近她的，他的脚碰着她的脚。她划着轻柔的、缠绵的，渴望他能对她说一些有意义的话。但他保持沉默。

‘You like this, do you?’ she said, in a gentle, solicitous voice.
“你喜欢这个，是吗？”她用温柔而关切的声音说道。

He laughed shortly.
他短促地笑了一声。

‘There is a space between us,’ he said, in the same low, unconscious voice, as if something were speaking out of him. And she was as if magically aware of their being balanced in separation, in the boat. She swooned with acute comprehension and pleasure.
“我们之间有一个空间，”他用同样低沉、无意识的声音说道，仿佛有什么东西从他嘴里发出来。她仿佛神奇地意识到他们在船上的分离中保持着平衡。她带着敏锐的领悟和喜悦而昏倒了。

‘But I’m very near,’ she said caressively, gaily.
“但我已经很接近了，”她轻快而轻柔地说。

‘Yet distant, distant,’ he said.
“然而遥远，遥远，”他说。

Again she was silent with pleasure, before she answered, speaking with a reedy, thrilled voice:
她再次高兴地沉默了，然后用尖细而激动的声音回答：

‘Yet we cannot very well change, whilst we are on the water.’ She caressed him subtly and strangely, having him completely at her mercy.
“然而，当我们在水面上时，我们无法很好地改变。”她微妙而奇怪地爱抚着他，让他完全听从她的摆布。

A dozen or more boats on the lake swung their rosy and moon-like lanterns low on the water, that reflected as from a fire. In the distance, the steamer twanged and thrummed and washed with her faintly-splashing paddles, trailing her strings of coloured lights, and occasionally lighting up the whole scene luridly with an effusion of fireworks, Roman candles and sheafs of stars and other simple effects, illuminating the surface of the water, and showing the boats creeping round, low down. Then the lovely darkness fell again, the lanterns and the little threaded lights glimmered softly, there was a muffled knocking of oars and a waving of music.
湖上十几条小船，在水面上低低地摇曳着玫瑰色的月亮般的灯笼，倒映着火光。远处，汽船用她微微溅起的桨发出叮当声、轰鸣声和冲刷声，拖曳着一串串彩色灯光，时不时地用烟火、罗马蜡烛、星星和其他简单的效果，把整个场景照亮得可怕，照亮了水面，显示出船只在低处缓慢行驶。然后可爱的黑暗再次降临，灯笼和小线灯发出柔和的光芒，传来低沉的桨声和音乐的波动。

Gudrun paddled almost imperceptibly. Gerald could see, not far ahead, the rich blue and the rose globes of Ursula’s lanterns swaying softly cheek to cheek as Birkin rowed, and iridescent, evanescent gleams chasing in the wake. He was aware, too, of his own delicately coloured lights casting their softness behind him.
古德伦几乎难以察觉地划着桨。杰拉尔德可以看到，在前方不远处，乌苏拉的灯笼的浓郁蓝色和玫瑰色球体在伯金划船时脸颊轻轻地摇曳，虹彩般的、转瞬即逝的光芒在尾流中追逐。他也意识到自己的彩色光芒在他身后投射出柔和的光芒。

Gudrun rested her paddle and looked round. The canoe lifted with the lightest ebbing of the water. Gerald’s white knees were very near to her.
古珍放下桨，环顾四周。独木舟随着水流最轻微的退潮而升起。杰拉德雪白的膝盖离她很近。

‘Isn’t it beautiful!’ she said softly, as if reverently.
“这不是很漂亮吗！”她轻声说道，仿佛很虔诚。

She looked at him, as he leaned back against the faint crystal of the lantern-light. She could see his face, although it was a pure shadow. But it was a piece of twilight. And her breast was keen with passion for him, he was so beautiful in his male stillness and mystery. It was a certain pure effluence of maleness, like an aroma from his softly, firmly moulded contours, a certain rich perfection of his presence, that touched her with an ecstasy, a thrill of pure intoxication. She loved to look at him. For the present she did not want to touch him, to know the further, satisfying substance of his living body. He was purely intangible, yet so near. Her hands lay on the paddle like slumber, she only wanted to see him, like a crystal shadow, to feel his essential presence.
当他靠在微弱的水晶灯下时，她看着他。她能看到他的脸，尽管那只是纯粹的影子。但这只是一片黄昏。她的胸膛里充满了对他的热情，他在男性的沉静和神秘中显得如此美丽。这是一种纯粹的男性气质，就像他柔和、坚定的轮廓散发出的香气，他存在的某种丰富的完美，让她感到狂喜，一种纯粹陶醉的兴奋。她喜欢看着他。目前她不想碰他，不想进一步了解他活生生的身体的实质内容。他纯粹是无形的，但却如此接近。她的双手像睡梦一样放在桨上，她只想看到他，就像一个水晶影子，感受他的本质存在。

‘Yes,’ he said vaguely. ‘It is very beautiful.’
“是的，”他含糊地说。 “它非常漂亮。”

He was listening to the faint near sounds, the dropping of water-drops from the oar-blades, the slight drumming of the lanterns behind him, as they rubbed against one another, the occasional rustling of Gudrun’s full skirt, an alien land noise. His mind was almost submerged, he was almost transfused, lapsed out for the first time in his life, into the things about him. For he always kept such a keen attentiveness, concentrated and unyielding in himself. Now he had let go, imperceptibly he was melting into oneness with the whole. It was like pure, perfect sleep, his first great sleep of life. He had been so insistent, so guarded, all his life. But here was sleep, and peace, and perfect lapsing out.
他聆听着附近微弱的声音，水滴从桨叶上滴落下来，身后的灯笼相互摩擦时发出的轻微的鼓声，古德伦的长裙偶尔发出的沙沙声，一种陌生的土地噪音。他的思想几乎被淹没了，他几乎被注入了生命中的一切，这是他一生中第一次沉浸在关于他的事情中。因为他始终保持着如此敏锐的专注力、专注力和不屈不挠的精神。现在他已经放手了，不知不觉间他就融入了整体。这就像纯净、完美的睡眠，是他人生中第一次美美的睡眠。他一生都是如此坚持，如此谨慎。但这里有睡眠，有平静，还有完美的昏睡。

‘Shall I row to the landing-stage?’ asked Gudrun wistfully.
“我要划船去码头吗？”古珍若有所思地问道。

‘Anywhere,’ he answered. ‘Let it drift.’
“任何地方，”他回答。 “让它随波逐流吧。”

‘Tell me then, if we are running into anything,’ she replied, in that very quiet, toneless voice of sheer intimacy.
“那么，如果我们遇到什么事情，请告诉我。”她回答道，声音非常安静，语气平淡，充满了亲密感。

‘The lights will show,’ he said.
“灯光会显示出来，”他说。

So they drifted almost motionless, in silence. He wanted silence, pure and whole. But she was uneasy yet for some word, for some assurance.
所以他们几乎一动不动地漂流着，一片寂静。他想要安静、纯粹、完整。但她还是因为某些话、某些保证而感到不安。

‘Nobody will miss you?’ she asked, anxious for some communication.
“没有人会想念你吗？”她问道，急切地想要沟通。

‘Miss me?’ he echoed. ‘No! Why?’
“想我了吗？”他重复道。 '不！为什么？'

‘I wondered if anybody would be looking for you.’
“我想知道是否有人会来找你。”

‘Why should they look for me?’ And then he remembered his manners. ‘But perhaps you want to get back,’ he said, in a changed voice.
“他们为什么要找我？”然后他想起了自己的举止。 “但也许你想回去，”他声音变了。

‘No, I don’t want to get back,’ she replied. ‘No, I assure you.’
“不，我不想回去，”她回答道。 “不，我向你保证。”

‘You’re quite sure it’s all right for you?’
“你确定这对你来说没问题吗？”

‘Perfectly all right.’
“完全没问题。”

And again they were still. The launch twanged and hooted, somebody was singing. Then as if the night smashed, suddenly there was a great shout, a confusion of shouting, warring on the water, then the horrid noise of paddles reversed and churned violently.
他们又安静了。汽艇发出刺耳的声音和汽笛声，有人在唱歌。就在这时，仿佛夜幕降临，突然传来一阵巨大的叫喊声，一片混乱的叫喊声，在水面上交战，接着可怕的桨声反转，剧烈地翻动。

Gerald sat up, and Gudrun looked at him in fear.
杰拉德坐了起来，古德伦惊恐地看着他。

‘Somebody in the water,’ he said, angrily, and desperately, looking keenly across the dusk. ‘Can you row up?’
“有人在水里。”他目光敏锐地望着暮色，愤怒而绝望地说。 “你能划船吗？”

‘Where, to the launch?’ asked Gudrun, in nervous panic.
“去哪里，到发射场？”古德伦紧张地惊慌地问道。

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

‘You’ll tell me if I don’t steer straight,’ she said, in nervous apprehension.
“如果我不直接驾驶，你会告诉我的，”她紧张不安地说道。

‘You keep pretty level,’ he said, and the canoe hastened forward.
“你保持相当水平，”他说，独木舟加速前进。

The shouting and the noise continued, sounding horrid through the dusk, over the surface of the water.
喊叫声和噪音仍在继续，在黄昏的水面上听起来令人毛骨悚然。

‘Wasn’t this BOUND to happen?’ said Gudrun, with heavy hateful irony. But he hardly heard, and she glanced over her shoulder to see her way. The half-dark waters were sprinkled with lovely bubbles of swaying lights, the launch did not look far off. She was rocking her lights in the early night. Gudrun rowed as hard as she could. But now that it was a serious matter, she seemed uncertain and clumsy in her stroke, it was difficult to paddle swiftly. She glanced at his face. He was looking fixedly into the darkness, very keen and alert and single in himself, instrumental. Her heart sank, she seemed to die a death. ‘Of course,’ she said to herself, ‘nobody will be drowned. Of course they won’t. It would be too extravagant and sensational.’ But her heart was cold, because of his sharp impersonal face. It was as if he belonged naturally to dread and catastrophe, as if he were himself again.
“这不是一定会发生的吗？”古德伦带着浓浓的仇恨讽刺意味说道。但他几乎没听见，她回头看了看自己的路。半暗的水面上洒满了摇曳的灯光，可爱的气泡，汽艇看起来并不遥远。深夜，她摇着灯。古德伦竭尽全力划船。但现在事情严重了，她的划水显得飘忽不定，动作笨拙，很难划得快。她瞥了一眼他的脸。他目不转睛地看着黑暗，非常敏锐、警觉，他自己单一、有作用。她的心一沉，仿佛死了一般。 “当然，”她对自己说，“没有人会被淹死。”他们当然不会。太奢侈太煽情了。”但她的心却冷了，因为他那张锐利的、没有人情味的脸。仿佛他天生就属于恐惧和灾难，仿佛他又变回了自己。

Then there came a child’s voice, a girl’s high, piercing shriek:
然后传来一个孩子的声音，一个女孩高亢而刺耳的尖叫声：

‘Di—Di—Di—Di—Oh Di—Oh Di—Oh Di!’
“滴——滴——滴——噢滴——噢滴——噢滴！”

The blood ran cold in Gudrun’s veins.
古德伦的血管里的血液变冷了。

‘It’s Diana, is it,’ muttered Gerald. ‘The young monkey, she’d have to be up to some of her tricks.’
“是戴安娜，是吗？”杰拉尔德嘀咕道。 “这只小猴子，她一定会耍一些把戏。”

And he glanced again at the paddle, the boat was not going quickly enough for him. It made Gudrun almost helpless at the rowing, this nervous stress. She kept up with all her might. Still the voices were calling and answering.
他又看了一眼桨，船对他来说速度不够快。这种紧张的压力让古德伦在划船时几乎束手无策。她用尽全力跟上了。仍然有声音在呼唤和应答。

‘Where, where? There you are—that’s it. Which? No—No-o-o. Damn it all, here, HERE—‘ Boats were hurrying from all directions to the scene, coloured lanterns could be seen waving close to the surface of the lake, reflections swaying after them in uneven haste. The steamer hooted again, for some unknown reason. Gudrun’s boat was travelling quickly, the lanterns were swinging behind Gerald.
'哪里哪里？你就在那里——就是这样。哪个？不——不——不——不。该死的，这里，这里——”船只从四面八方赶来，彩色灯笼在湖面附近飘扬，倒影在灯笼后面摇曳不定。不知道什么原因，轮船又发出汽笛声。古德伦的船正在快速行驶，灯笼在杰拉尔德身后摇摆。

And then again came the child’s high, screaming voice, with a note of weeping and impatience in it now:
紧接着，孩子高亢的尖叫声再次响起，声音里带着哭腔和不耐烦：

‘Di—Oh Di—Oh Di—Di—!’
“迪——哦迪——哦迪——迪——！”

It was a terrible sound, coming through the obscure air of the evening.
这是一个可怕的声音，从傍晚阴暗的空气中传来。

‘You’d be better if you were in bed, Winnie,’ Gerald muttered to himself.
“温妮，如果你躺在床上就好了，”杰拉德自言自语道。

He was stooping unlacing his shoes, pushing them off with the foot. Then he threw his soft hat into the bottom of the boat.
他弯下腰​​，解开鞋带，用脚把它们推开。然后他把他的软帽扔进了船底。

‘You can’t go into the water with your hurt hand,’ said Gudrun, panting, in a low voice of horror.
“你不能用受伤的手进入水中，”古德伦气喘吁吁地说，声音低沉，充满恐惧。

‘What? It won’t hurt.’
'什么？不会受伤的。

He had struggled out of his jacket, and had dropped it between his feet. He sat bare-headed, all in white now. He felt the belt at his waist. They were nearing the launch, which stood still big above them, her myriad lamps making lovely darts, and sinuous running tongues of ugly red and green and yellow light on the lustrous dark water, under the shadow.
他费力地脱下夹克，把它放在两脚之间。他光着头坐着，现在一身白衣。他感觉到腰间的皮带。他们正在接近冲锋艇，冲锋艇仍然高大地矗立在他们上方，无数的灯发出可爱的飞镖，在阴影下闪亮的黑暗水面上蜿蜒流淌着难看的红色、绿色和黄色的光芒。

‘Oh get her out! Oh Di, DARLING! Oh get her out! Oh Daddy, Oh Daddy!’ moaned the child’s voice, in distraction. Somebody was in the water, with a life belt. Two boats paddled near, their lanterns swinging ineffectually, the boats nosing round.
‘哦，把她赶出去！哦迪，亲爱的！噢，把她赶出去！噢，爸爸，噢，爸爸！”孩子心烦意乱地呻吟着。有人在水里，身上系着救生带。两艘船划近了，灯笼无效地摇晃着，船在转头。

‘Hi there—Rockley!—hi there!’
“你好——罗克利！——你好！”

‘Mr Gerald!’ came the captain’s terrified voice. ‘Miss Diana’s in the water.’
“杰拉尔德先生！”船长惊恐的声音传来。 “戴安娜小姐在水里。”

‘Anybody gone in for her?’ came Gerald’s sharp voice.
“有人喜欢她吗？”杰拉尔德尖锐的声音传来。

‘Young Doctor Brindell, sir.’
“年轻的布林德尔医生，先生。”

‘Where?’
'在哪里？'

‘Can’t see no signs of them, sir. Everybody’s looking, but there’s nothing so far.’
“看不到他们的任何踪迹，长官。每个人都在寻找，但到目前为止还没有任何进展。”

There was a moment’s ominous pause.
一阵不祥的停顿。

‘Where did she go in?’
“她进去哪儿了？”

‘I think—about where that boat is,’ came the uncertain answer, ‘that one with red and green lights.’
“我想——那艘船在哪里，”不确定的回答传来，“那艘有红灯和绿灯的船。”

‘Row there,’ said Gerald quietly to Gudrun.
“划到那里去，”杰拉德轻声对古德伦说。

‘Get her out, Gerald, oh get her out,’ the child’s voice was crying anxiously. He took no heed.
“把她弄出来，杰拉尔德，哦，把她弄出来，”孩子的声音焦急地哭着。他没有在意。

‘Lean back that way,’ said Gerald to Gudrun, as he stood up in the frail boat. ‘She won’t upset.’
“向后倾斜，”杰拉德在脆弱的船上站起来时对古德伦说道。 “她不会不高兴的。”

In another moment, he had dropped clean down, soft and plumb, into the water. Gudrun was swaying violently in her boat, the agitated water shook with transient lights, she realised that it was faintly moonlight, and that he was gone. So it was possible to be gone. A terrible sense of fatality robbed her of all feeling and thought. She knew he was gone out of the world, there was merely the same world, and absence, his absence. The night seemed large and vacuous. Lanterns swayed here and there, people were talking in an undertone on the launch and in the boats. She could hear Winifred moaning: ‘OH DO FIND HER GERALD, DO FIND HER,’ and someone trying to comfort the child. Gudrun paddled aimlessly here and there. The terrible, massive, cold, boundless surface of the water terrified her beyond words. Would he never come back? She felt she must jump into the water too, to know the horror also.
又过了一会儿，他就彻底地掉进了水里，柔软而垂直。戈德伦在她的船上剧烈摇晃，激荡的水面随着短暂的光芒而摇晃，她意识到那是微弱的月光，而他已经走了。所以离开是有可能的。一种可怕的宿命感夺走了她所有的感觉和思想。她知道他已经离开了这个世界，只剩下同一个世界，缺席了，他缺席了。夜晚显得广阔而空虚。灯笼到处摇曳，冲锋艇上和船上的人们低声交谈。她能听到威妮弗雷德呻吟着：“哦，一定要找到她的杰拉德，一定要找到她”，还有人试图安慰孩子。古德伦漫无目的地划桨。可怕的、巨大的、冰冷的、无边无际的水面让她感到无法言喻的恐惧。他永远不会回来吗？她觉得自己也必须跳进水里，才能知道其中的恐怖。

She started, hearing someone say: ‘There he is.’ She saw the movement of his swimming, like a water-rat. And she rowed involuntarily to him. But he was near another boat, a bigger one. Still she rowed towards him. She must be very near. She saw him—he looked like a seal. He looked like a seal as he took hold of the side of the boat. His fair hair was washed down on his round head, his face seemed to glisten suavely. She could hear him panting.
她听到有人说：“他在那儿。”她看到他游泳的动作，就像一只水鼠。她不由自主地划向他。但他靠近另一艘船，一艘更大的船。她仍然向他划去。她一定很近。她看到了他——他看起来像一只海豹。当他抓住船舷时，他看起来就像一只海豹。金色的头发披散在圆圆的头上，脸上显得温文尔雅。她能听到他的喘息声。

Then he clambered into the boat. Oh, and the beauty of the subjection of his loins, white and dimly luminous as be climbed over the side of the boat, made her want to die, to die. The beauty of his dim and luminous loins as be climbed into the boat, his back rounded and soft—ah, this was too much for her, too final a vision. She knew it, and it was fatal The terrible hopelessness of fate, and of beauty, such beauty!
然后他就爬上了船。哦，还有他的腰部的屈从之美，白色的、微光的，就像爬上船舷一样，让她想死，想死。当他爬上船时，他那暗淡而明亮的腰部的美丽，他的背部圆润而柔软——啊，这对她来说太难以承受了，太最终的幻象。她知道，这是致命的，命运的可怕绝望，还有美丽，如此美丽！

He was not like a man to her, he was an incarnation, a great phase of life. She saw him press the water out of his face, and look at the bandage on his hand. And she knew it was all no good, and that she would never go beyond him, he was the final approximation of life to her.
对她来说，他不像一个男人，他是一个化身，是人生的一个伟大阶段。她看见他把脸上的水擦掉，又看看他手上的绷带。她知道这一切都是没有好处的，她永远无法超越他，他是她生命中最后的近似。

‘Put the lights out, we shall see better,’ came his voice, sudden and mechanical and belonging to the world of man. She could scarcely believe there was a world of man. She leaned round and blew out her lanterns. They were difficult to blow out. Everywhere the lights were gone save the coloured points on the sides of the launch. The blueygrey, early night spread level around, the moon was overhead, there were shadows of boats here and there.
“把灯关掉，我们会看得更清楚。”他的声音突然而机械，属于人类世界。她简直不敢相信还有一个男人的世界。她弯下身子，吹灭了灯笼。它们很难被吹灭。除了冲锋艇两侧的彩色点外，所有地方的灯光都消失了。蓝灰色的初夜笼罩着周围，月亮在头顶上，到处都是船只的影子。

Again there was a splash, and he was gone under. Gudrun sat, sick at heart, frightened of the great, level surface of the water, so heavy and deadly. She was so alone, with the level, unliving field of the water stretching beneath her. It was not a good isolation, it was a terrible, cold separation of suspense. She was suspended upon the surface of the insidious reality until such time as she also should disappear beneath it.
再次溅起水花，他被淹没了。古德伦坐在那里，心里很难受，他害怕那片巨大而平坦的水面，如此沉重而致命。她是如此孤独，脚下是一片平坦、死气沉沉的水面。这不是一个很好的隔离，这是一个可怕的、冰冷的悬念分离。她悬浮在阴险现实的表面，直到她也消失在现实之下。

Then she knew, by a stirring of voices, that he had climbed out again, into a boat. She sat wanting connection with him. Strenuously she claimed her connection with him, across the invisible space of the water. But round her heart was an isolation unbearable, through which nothing would penetrate.
然后，从一阵骚动的声音中，她知道他又爬了出来，上了一条船。她坐着想与他建立联系。她跨越无形的水面，努力地宣称自己与他有联系。但她的心却是一种难以忍受的孤立，任何东西都无法穿透。

‘Take the launch in. It’s no use keeping her there. Get lines for the dragging,’ came the decisive, instrumental voice, that was full of the sound of the world.
“把发射带进去。把她留在那里是没有用的。”准备好拖拽的台词，”那果断的、乐器般的声音传来，充满了世界的声音。

The launch began gradually to beat the waters.
发射开始逐渐战胜水面。

‘Gerald! Gerald!’ came the wild crying voice of Winifred. He did not answer. Slowly the launch drifted round in a pathetic, clumsy circle, and slunk away to the land, retreating into the dimness. The wash of her paddles grew duller. Gudrun rocked in her light boat, and dipped the paddle automatically to steady herself.
杰拉德！杰拉德！”威妮弗雷德狂野地哭喊着。他没有回答。汽艇慢慢地绕着一个可悲的、笨拙的圆圈漂流，然后偷偷溜向陆地，退回到昏暗的地方。她的桨的洗涤效果变得更加暗淡。古德伦的小船摇晃着，她自动地划下桨来稳定自己。

‘Gudrun?’ called Ursula’s voice.
“古德伦？”乌苏拉的声音响起。

‘Ursula!’
“乌苏拉！”

The boats of the two sisters pulled together.
两姐妹的船并拢在一起。

‘Where is Gerald?’ said Gudrun.
“杰拉尔德在哪儿？”古德伦问。

‘He’s dived again,’ said Ursula plaintively. ‘And I know he ought not, with his hurt hand and everything.’
“他又潜水了。”乌苏拉哀怨地说。 “我知道他不应该这样做，因为他的手受伤了，一切都受伤了。”

‘I’ll take him in home this time,’ said Birkin.
“这次我会带他回家，”伯金说。

The boats swayed again from the wash of steamer. Gudrun and Ursula kept a look-out for Gerald.
船只因汽船的冲刷而再次摇晃。古德伦和乌苏拉一直留意着杰拉尔德。

‘There he is!’ cried Ursula, who had the sharpest eyes. He had not been long under. Birkin pulled towards him, Gudrun following. He swam slowly, and caught hold of the boat with his wounded hand. It slipped, and he sank back.
“他在那儿！”乌苏拉喊道，她的眼睛最锐利。他在水下没呆多久。伯金向他拉近，古德伦紧随其后。他慢慢地游着，用受伤的手抓住了船。它滑倒了，他又沉了下去。

‘Why don’t you help him?’ cried Ursula sharply.
“你为什么不帮他？”乌苏拉尖声叫道。

He came again, and Birkin leaned to help him in to the boat. Gudrun again watched Gerald climb out of the water, but this time slowly, heavily, with the blind clambering motions of an amphibious beast, clumsy. Again the moon shone with faint luminosity on his white wet figure, on the stooping back and the rounded loins. But it looked defeated now, his body, it clambered and fell with slow clumsiness. He was breathing hoarsely too, like an animal that is suffering. He sat slack and motionless in the boat, his head blunt and blind like a seal’s, his whole appearance inhuman, unknowing. Gudrun shuddered as she mechanically followed his boat. Birkin rowed without speaking to the landing-stage.
他又来了，伯金倾身扶他上了船。古德伦再次看着杰拉尔德爬出水面，但这一次缓慢而沉重，像两栖野兽盲目的攀爬动作，笨拙。月光再次在他雪白湿漉的身躯、弯腰驼背和圆润的腰部上洒下微弱的光辉。但现在他的身体看起来被打败了，缓慢地笨拙地爬上爬下。他的呼吸也变得嘶哑，就像一只正在受苦的动物。他懒散地坐在船上，一动不动，脑袋像海豹一样钝而盲目，整个人看起来毫无人性，毫无知觉。古德伦机械地跟着他的船，浑身颤抖。伯金划着船，没有对着登陆台说话。

‘Where are you going?’ Gerald asked suddenly, as if just waking up.
“你要去哪里？”杰拉尔德突然问道，就像刚睡醒一样。

‘Home,’ said Birkin.
“回家了，”伯金说。

‘Oh no!’ said Gerald imperiously. ‘We can’t go home while they’re in the water. Turn back again, I’m going to find them.’ The women were frightened, his voice was so imperative and dangerous, almost mad, not to be opposed.
“哦，不！”杰拉德专横地说。 “当他们在水里时我们不能回家。再回头，我要找到她们了。”女人们都害怕了，他的声音是如此命令和危险，几乎是疯狂，不容反对。

‘No!’ said Birkin. ‘You can’t.’ There was a strange fluid compulsion in his voice. Gerald was silent in a battle of wills. It was as if he would kill the other man. But Birkin rowed evenly and unswerving, with an inhuman inevitability.
“不！”伯金说。 “你不能。”他的声音里有一种奇怪的、流畅的强迫感。杰拉德在意志的较量中保持沉默。就好像他要杀死另一个人一样。但伯金划得很均匀，坚定不移，带着一种非人的必然性。

‘Why should you interfere?’ said Gerald, in hate.
“你为什么要干涉？”杰拉尔德怨恨地说。

Birkin did not answer. He rowed towards the land. And Gerald sat mute, like a dumb beast, panting, his teeth chattering, his arms inert, his head like a seal’s head.
伯金没有回答。他划向陆地。杰拉德一言不发地坐着，像一头不会说话的野兽，气喘吁吁，牙齿打颤，手臂无力，头像海豹的头。

They came to the landing-stage. Wet and naked-looking, Gerald climbed up the few steps. There stood his father, in the night.
他们来到了登陆台。浑身湿透、赤身裸体的杰拉尔德爬上几级台阶。夜色中，他的父亲站在那里。

‘Father!’ he said.
“父亲！”他说。

‘Yes my boy? Go home and get those things off.’
‘是吗，我的孩子？回家把那些东西脱掉吧。

‘We shan’t save them, father,’ said Gerald.
“我们救不了他们，父亲，”杰拉尔德说。

‘There’s hope yet, my boy.’
“还有希望，我的孩子。”

‘I’m afraid not. There’s no knowing where they are. You can’t find them. And there’s a current, as cold as hell.’
'恐怕不是。不知道他们在哪里。你找不到他们。还有一股电流，冷得像地狱。

‘We’ll let the water out,’ said the father. ‘Go home you and look to yourself. See that he’s looked after, Rupert,’ he added in a neutral voice.
“我们会把水放掉，”父亲说。 ‘你回家看看你自己吧。鲁珀特，确保他得到照顾。”他用中性的声音补充道。

‘Well father, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m afraid it’s my fault. But it can’t be helped; I’ve done what I could for the moment. I could go on diving, of course—not much, though—and not much use—‘
‘好吧，父亲，我很抱歉。对不起。恐怕是我的错。但这也是没办法的事。目前我已经尽力了。当然，我可以继续潜水——不过不多——而且没什么用处——”

He moved away barefoot, on the planks of the platform. Then he trod on something sharp.
他赤脚走在平台的木板上。然后他踩到了一个尖锐的东西。

‘Of course, you’ve got no shoes on,’ said Birkin.
“当然，你没穿鞋，”伯金说。

‘His shoes are here!’ cried Gudrun from below. She was making fast her boat.
“他的鞋子在这里！”古德伦在下面喊道。她正在拉紧她的船。

Gerald waited for them to be brought to him. Gudrun came with them. He pulled them on his feet.
杰拉尔德等待着他们被带到他身边。古德伦和他们一起来了。他把它们拉到脚上。

‘If you once die,’ he said, ‘then when it’s over, it’s finished. Why come to life again? There’s room under that water there for thousands.’
“如果你死了一次，”他说，“那么当一切结束时，一切都结束了。”为什么又复活了？水下有可容纳数千人的空间。

‘Two is enough,’ she said murmuring.
“两个就够了。”她低声说道。

He dragged on his second shoe. He was shivering violently, and his jaw shook as he spoke.
他拖着第二只鞋。他浑身剧烈颤抖，说话时下巴都在颤抖。

‘That’s true,’ he said, ‘maybe. But it’s curious how much room there seems, a whole universe under there; and as cold as hell, you’re as helpless as if your head was cut off.’ He could scarcely speak, he shook so violently. ‘There’s one thing about our family, you know,’ he continued. ‘Once anything goes wrong, it can never be put right again—not with us. I’ve noticed it all my life—you can’t put a thing right, once it has gone wrong.’
“确实如此，”他说，“也许吧。”但令人好奇的是，那里似乎有多大的空间，下面有整个宇宙；冷得要命，你就像头被砍掉一样无助。”他几乎说不出话来，浑身剧烈地颤抖着。 “你知道，我们家有一件事，”他继续说道。 “一旦出了问题，就永远无法再纠正了——对我们来说是这样。”我一生都注意到这一点——一旦事情出了问题，你就无法纠正它。

They were walking across the high-road to the house.
他们正穿过大路朝房子走去。

‘And do you know, when you are down there, it is so cold, actually, and so endless, so different really from what it is on top, so endless—you wonder how it is so many are alive, why we’re up here. Are you going? I shall see you again, shan’t I? Good-night, and thank you. Thank you very much!’
“你知道吗，当你在下面的时候，实际上是那么寒冷，那么无尽，与上面的情况非常不同，那么无尽——你想知道为什么这么多人还活着，为什么我们上面这儿。你要去吗？我还会再见到你的，不是吗？晚安，谢谢。非常感谢！'

The two girls waited a while, to see if there were any hope. The moon shone clearly overhead, with almost impertinent brightness, the small dark boats clustered on the water, there were voices and subdued shouts. But it was all to no purpose. Gudrun went home when Birkin returned.
两个女孩等了一会儿，看看还有没有希望。头顶上的月亮清晰地照着，明亮得近乎不合时宜，水面上密布着黑色的小船，有说话声和低沉的叫喊声。但这一切都是徒劳。伯金回来后，古德伦也回家了。

He was commissioned to open the sluice that let out the water from the lake, which was pierced at one end, near the high-road, thus serving as a reservoir to supply with water the distant mines, in case of necessity. ‘Come with me,’ he said to Ursula, ‘and then I will walk home with you, when I’ve done this.’
他受命打开水闸，将水从湖中放出，水闸在靠近公路的一端被刺穿，从而作为水库，在需要时向远处的矿井供水。 “跟我来，”他对乌苏拉说，“等我做完这件事，我会和你一起走回家。”

He called at the water-keeper’s cottage and took the key of the sluice. They went through a little gate from the high-road, to the head of the water, where was a great stone basin which received the overflow, and a flight of stone steps descended into the depths of the water itself. At the head of the steps was the lock of the sluice-gate.
他拜访了守水人的小屋，拿走了水闸的钥匙。他们从大路上穿过一个小门，来到水源头，那里有一个巨大的石盆，用来接收溢流，一段石阶下降到水的深处。台阶的尽头是水闸的锁。

The night was silver-grey and perfect, save for the scattered restless sound of voices. The grey sheen of the moonlight caught the stretch of water, dark boats plashed and moved. But Ursula’s mind ceased to be receptive, everything was unimportant and unreal.
夜晚是银灰色的，完美无缺，除了零星的不安的声音。灰色的月光映照着水面，黑色的小船拍打着、移动着。但乌苏拉的头脑不再具有接受能力，一切都变得不重要、不真实。

Birkin fixed the iron handle of the sluice, and turned it with a wrench. The cogs began slowly to rise. He turned and turned, like a slave, his white figure became distinct. Ursula looked away. She could not bear to see him winding heavily and laboriously, bending and rising mechanically like a slave, turning the handle.
伯金把水闸的铁把手固定好，用扳手转动。齿轮开始缓慢上升。他转了又转，就像一个奴隶一样，白色的身影变得清晰起来。乌苏拉移开了视线。她不忍心看到他像奴隶一样沉重而费力地缠绕着，机械地弯腰起身，转动把手。

Then, a real shock to her, there came a loud splashing of water from out of the dark, tree-filled hollow beyond the road, a splashing that deepened rapidly to a harsh roar, and then became a heavy, booming noise of a great body of water falling solidly all the time. It occupied the whole of the night, this great steady booming of water, everything was drowned within it, drowned and lost. Ursula seemed to have to struggle for her life. She put her hands over her ears, and looked at the high bland moon.
然后，令她震惊的是，从路边黑暗、树木丛生的洼地里传来了巨大的水花飞溅声，飞溅声迅速加深，变成了刺耳的轰鸣声，然后变成了巨大的、轰隆隆的噪音。水体一直坚实地落下。它占据了整个夜晚，这巨大而稳定的洪水，一切都被淹没在其中，淹没和迷失。乌苏拉似乎不得不为自己的生命而奋斗。她双手捂住耳朵，看着高高的柔和的月亮。

‘Can’t we go now?’ she cried to Birkin, who was watching the water on the steps, to see if it would get any lower. It seemed to fascinate him. He looked at her and nodded.
“我们现在不能走吗？”她对伯金喊道，伯金正在台阶上观察水位，看水位是否会降低。这似乎令他着迷。他看着她，点点头。

The little dark boats had moved nearer, people were crowding curiously along the hedge by the high-road, to see what was to be seen. Birkin and Ursula went to the cottage with the key, then turned their backs on the lake. She was in great haste. She could not bear the terrible crushing boom of the escaping water.
黑色的小船已经靠近了，人们好奇地沿着公路旁的树篱聚集，想看看会发生什么。伯金和乌苏拉带着钥匙去了小屋，然后背对着湖水。她非常匆忙。她无法忍受溢出的水所发出的可怕的破碎声。

‘Do you think they are dead?’ she cried in a high voice, to make herself heard.
“你认为他们死了吗？”她大声喊道，好让自己的声音被听到。

‘Yes,’ he replied.
“是的，”他回答道。

‘Isn’t it horrible!’
“这不是太可怕了吗！”

He paid no heed. They walked up the hill, further and further away from the noise.
他没有理睬。他们向山上走去，距离喧嚣越来越远。

‘Do you mind very much?’ she asked him.
“你很介意吗？”她问他。

‘I don’t mind about the dead,’ he said, ‘once they are dead. The worst of it is, they cling on to the living, and won’t let go.’
“我不介意死者，”他说，“一旦他们死了。”最糟糕的是，他们紧紧抓住活着的人不肯放手。

She pondered for a time.
她沉思了一会。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘The FACT of death doesn’t really seem to matter much, does it?’
“是的，”她说。 “死亡的事实似乎并不那么重要，不是吗？”

‘No,’ he said. ‘What does it matter if Diana Crich is alive or dead?’
“不，”他说。 “戴安娜·克里奇是死是活又有什么关系呢？”

‘Doesn’t it?’ she said, shocked.
“不是吗？”她震惊地说。

‘No, why should it? Better she were dead—she’ll be much more real. She’ll be positive in death. In life she was a fretting, negated thing.’
‘不，为什么要这样呢？她最好死了——她会更加真实。她死后会保持积极的态度。在生活中，她是一个令人烦躁、被否定的人。

‘You are rather horrible,’ murmured Ursula.
“你太可怕了，”乌苏拉低声说道。

‘No! I’d rather Diana Crich were dead. Her living somehow, was all wrong. As for the young man, poor devil—he’ll find his way out quickly instead of slowly. Death is all right—nothing better.’
'不！我宁愿戴安娜·克里奇死了。不知何故，她的生活完全是错误的。至于那个年轻人，可怜的家伙——他会很快而不是慢慢地找到出路。死亡也没什么不好——没有什么比这更好的了。

‘Yet you don’t want to die,’ she challenged him.
“但你不想死，”她挑战他。

He was silent for a time. Then he said, in a voice that was frightening to her in its change:
他沉默了一会儿。然后他说，声音的变化让她感到害怕：

‘I should like to be through with it—I should like to be through with the death process.’
“我希望结束这一切——我希望结束死亡过程。”

‘And aren’t you?’ asked Ursula nervously.
“你不是吗？”乌苏拉紧张地问。

They walked on for some way in silence, under the trees. Then he said, slowly, as if afraid:
他们在树下默默地走了一段路。然后他缓慢地说，仿佛很害怕：

‘There is life which belongs to death, and there is life which isn’t death. One is tired of the life that belongs to death—our kind of life. But whether it is finished, God knows. I want love that is like sleep, like being born again, vulnerable as a baby that just comes into the world.’
‘有属于死亡的生命，也有不属于死亡的生命。人们厌倦了属于死亡的生活——我们这种生活。但最终是否完成，天知道。我想要的爱就像睡眠一样，就像重生一样，像刚来到这个世界的婴儿一样脆弱。

Ursula listened, half attentive, half avoiding what he said. She seemed to catch the drift of his statement, and then she drew away. She wanted to hear, but she did not want to be implicated. She was reluctant to yield there, where he wanted her, to yield as it were her very identity.
乌苏拉听着，一半专注，一半回避他的话。她似乎明白了他话里的意思，然后就离开了。她想听，却又不想被牵连。她不愿意屈服于他想要她屈服的地方，因为那是她的身份。

‘Why should love be like sleep?’ she asked sadly.
“为什么爱应该像睡眠一样？”她悲伤地问道。

‘I don’t know. So that it is like death—I DO want to die from this life—and yet it is more than life itself. One is delivered over like a naked infant from the womb, all the old defences and the old body gone, and new air around one, that has never been breathed before.’
'我不知道。所以这就像死亡——我确实想从这种生活中死去——但它又超越了生活本身。一个人就像一个从子宫里出来的赤身裸体的婴儿一样，所有旧的防御和旧的身体都消失了，新的空气围绕着他，这是以前从未呼吸过的。

She listened, making out what he said. She knew, as well as he knew, that words themselves do not convey meaning, that they are but a gesture we make, a dumb show like any other. And she seemed to feel his gesture through her blood, and she drew back, even though her desire sent her forward.
她听着，听明白他说的话。她知道，他也知道，言语本身并不能传达意义，它们只是我们所做的一个手势，就像其他任何表演一样的愚蠢表演。她似乎通过自己的血液感受到了他的手势，尽管她的欲望让她向前，但她还是向后退了一步。

‘But,’ she said gravely, ‘didn’t you say you wanted something that was NOT love—something beyond love?’
“但是，”她严肃地说，“你不是说你想要一些不是爱的东西——超越爱的东西吗？”

He turned in confusion. There was always confusion in speech. Yet it must be spoken. Whichever way one moved, if one were to move forwards, one must break a way through. And to know, to give utterance, was to break a way through the walls of the prison as the infant in labour strives through the walls of the womb. There is no new movement now, without the breaking through of the old body, deliberately, in knowledge, in the struggle to get out.
他困惑地转过身来。言语中总是含混不清。但它必须说出来。无论往哪边走，要想前进，就必须闯出一条路。知道、说出话语，就像分娩中的婴儿努力穿过子宫的墙壁一样，在监狱的墙壁上开辟出一条路。现在没有新的运动，没有突破旧的身体，刻意地，在知识中，在挣扎中摆脱出来。

‘I don’t want love,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to know you. I want to be gone out of myself, and you to be lost to yourself, so we are found different. One shouldn’t talk when one is tired and wretched. One Hamletises, and it seems a lie. Only believe me when I show you a bit of healthy pride and insouciance. I hate myself serious.’
“我不想要爱，”他说。 ‘我不想认识你。我想走出自我，你也想迷失自我，所以我们被发现不同。人在疲惫、困苦的时候不应该说话。一个哈姆雷特斯，这似乎是一个谎言。只有当我向你展示一点健康的骄傲和漫不经心时才相信我。我真的很讨厌自己。

‘Why shouldn’t you be serious?’ she said.
“你为什么不认真一点呢？”她说。

He thought for a minute, then he said, sulkily:
他想了想，然后阴沉地说道：

‘I don’t know.’ Then they walked on in silence, at outs. He was vague and lost.
“我不知道。”然后他们默默地继续前行。他语焉不详，迷失了方向。

‘Isn’t it strange,’ she said, suddenly putting her hand on his arm, with a loving impulse, ‘how we always talk like this! I suppose we do love each other, in some way.’
“这不是很奇怪吗？”她突然把手放在他的手臂上，带着一种爱意的冲动，“我们怎么总是这样说话！”我想我们在某种程度上确实彼此相爱。

‘Oh yes,’ he said; ‘too much.’
“哦，是的，”他说。 '太多了。'

She laughed almost gaily.
她几乎快活地笑了。

‘You’d have to have it your own way, wouldn’t you?’ she teased. ‘You could never take it on trust.’
“你必须按照自己的方式行事，不是吗？”她调侃道。 “你永远不能相信它。”

He changed, laughed softly, and turned and took her in his arms, in the middle of the road.
他换了身子，轻声笑了笑，转身将她抱在怀里，放在路中央。

‘Yes,’ he said softly.
“是的，”他轻声说。

And he kissed her face and brow, slowly, gently, with a sort of delicate happiness which surprised her extremely, and to which she could not respond. They were soft, blind kisses, perfect in their stillness. Yet she held back from them. It was like strange moths, very soft and silent, settling on her from the darkness of her soul. She was uneasy. She drew away.
他慢慢地、温柔地吻着她的脸和额头，带着一种微妙的幸福感，这让她极其惊讶，但她却无法回应。他们的吻轻柔而盲目，在安静中显得完美。但她却拒绝了他们。它就像奇怪的飞蛾，非常柔软、安静，从她灵魂的黑暗中落在她身上。她很不安。她退开。

‘Isn’t somebody coming?’ she said.
“没人来吗？”她说。

So they looked down the dark road, then set off again walking towards Beldover. Then suddenly, to show him she was no shallow prude, she stopped and held him tight, hard against her, and covered his face with hard, fierce kisses of passion. In spite of his otherness, the old blood beat up in him.
于是他们顺着黑暗的道路望去，然后再次出发，朝贝尔多弗走去。然后突然，为了向他表明她并不是浅薄的假正经，她停下来，紧紧地抱住他，用力地吻住他的脸，充满激情、猛烈地吻着他。尽管他与众不同，但古老的血液在他体内跳动。

‘Not this, not this,’ he whimpered to himself, as the first perfect mood of softness and sleep-loveliness ebbed back away from the rushing of passion that came up to his limbs and over his face as she drew him. And soon he was a perfect hard flame of passionate desire for her. Yet in the small core of the flame was an unyielding anguish of another thing. But this also was lost; he only wanted her, with an extreme desire that seemed inevitable as death, beyond question.
“不是这个，不是这个，”他对自己呜咽着，当她拉着他时，最初那种柔软和睡意般的完美情绪从涌上他四肢和脸上的激情中退去。很快，他就成为了对她充满热情的完美火焰。然而，在火焰的小核心里却隐藏着对另一种事物的不屈的痛苦。但这也失去了；他只想要她，带着一种毫无疑问就像死亡一样不可避免的极端渴望。

Then, satisfied and shattered, fulfilled and destroyed, he went home away from her, drifting vaguely through the darkness, lapsed into the old fire of burning passion. Far away, far away, there seemed to be a small lament in the darkness. But what did it matter? What did it matter, what did anything matter save this ultimate and triumphant experience of physical passion, that had blazed up anew like a new spell of life. ‘I was becoming quite dead-alive, nothing but a word-bag,’ he said in triumph, scorning his other self. Yet somewhere far off and small, the other hovered.
然后，满足又破碎，满足又毁灭，他离开她回家了，在黑暗中模糊地漂流，陷入了燃烧的激情的旧火中。很远很远，黑暗中似乎传来一阵小小的哀叹。但这有什么关系呢？除了这种最终的、胜利的肉体激情体验之外，还有什么重要的呢？这种激情就像生命的新咒语一样重新焕发活力。 “我变得死气沉沉，只剩下一个废话，”他得意洋洋地说，蔑视另一个自己。然而，另一个在遥远而渺小的地方徘徊。

The men were still dragging the lake when he got back. He stood on the bank and heard Gerald’s voice. The water was still booming in the night, the moon was fair, the hills beyond were elusive. The lake was sinking. There came the raw smell of the banks, in the night air.
当他回来时，那些人还在湖里拖着水。他站在岸边，听到杰拉德的声音。夜色依旧，流水潺潺，月色皎洁，远处的山峦若隐若现。湖水正在下沉。夜晚的空气中弥漫着河岸的原始气味。

Up at Shortlands there were lights in the windows, as if nobody had gone to bed. On the landing-stage was the old doctor, the father of the young man who was lost. He stood quite silent, waiting. Birkin also stood and watched, Gerald came up in a boat.
在肖特兰兹，窗户里亮着灯，好像没有人上床睡觉。着陆台上坐着一位老医生，他是迷路年轻人的父亲。他静静地站着，等待着。伯金也站着看着，杰拉德乘船上来。

‘You still here, Rupert?’ he said. ‘We can’t get them. The bottom slopes, you know, very steep. The water lies between two very sharp slopes, with little branch valleys, and God knows where the drift will take you. It isn’t as if it was a level bottom. You never know where you are, with the dragging.’
“你还在这里吗，鲁珀特？”他说。 ‘我们抓不到他们。你知道，底部的斜坡非常陡峭。水位于两个非常陡峭的斜坡之间，有小分支山谷，天知道漂流会把你带到哪里。它不像是一个水平的底部。你永远不知道自己在哪里，拖着拖着。”

‘Is there any need for you to be working?’ said Birkin. ‘Wouldn’t it be much better if you went to bed?’
“你有必要工作吗？”伯金说。 “如果你去睡觉不是更好吗？”

‘To bed! Good God, do you think I should sleep? We’ll find ‘em, before I go away from here.’
'睡觉！天啊，你觉得我应该睡觉吗？在我离开这里之前我们会找到他们。

‘But the men would find them just the same without you—why should you insist?’
“但是如果没有你，男人们也会觉得他们一样——你为什么要坚持呢？”

Gerald looked up at him. Then he put his hand affectionately on Birkin’s shoulder, saying:
杰拉德抬头看着他。然后他深情地将手放在Birkin的肩膀上，说道：

‘Don’t you bother about me, Rupert. If there’s anybody’s health to think about, it’s yours, not mine. How do you feel yourself?’
“你不用担心我，鲁珀特。如果要考虑任何人的健康，那是你的，而不是我的。你感觉怎么样？

‘Very well. But you, you spoil your own chance of life—you waste your best self.’
'很好。但你，你毁掉了自己的生活机会——你浪费了最好的自己。

Gerald was silent for a moment. Then he said:
杰拉德沉默了一会儿。然后他说：

‘Waste it? What else is there to do with it?’
'浪费？还有什么关系呢？

‘But leave this, won’t you? You force yourself into horrors, and put a mill-stone of beastly memories round your neck. Come away now.’
‘但是把这个留下吧，不是吗？你强迫自己陷入恐惧，把野兽记忆的磨石挂在你的脖子上。现在就走吧。

‘A mill-stone of beastly memories!’ Gerald repeated. Then he put his hand again affectionately on Birkin’s shoulder. ‘God, you’ve got such a telling way of putting things, Rupert, you have.’
“野兽记忆的磨石！”杰拉尔德重复道。然后他再次亲切地将手放在伯金的肩膀上。 “天哪，你的表达方式真是太有说服力了，鲁珀特，你有。”

Birkin’s heart sank. He was irritated and weary of having a telling way of putting things.
伯金的心沉了下去。他对用一种有说服力的表达方式感到恼火和厌倦。

‘Won’t you leave it? Come over to my place’—he urged as one urges a drunken man.
‘你不留下它吗？到我那儿来吧”——他像催促一个醉酒的人一样催促着。

‘No,’ said Gerald coaxingly, his arm across the other man’s shoulder. ‘Thanks very much, Rupert—I shall be glad to come tomorrow, if that’ll do. You understand, don’t you? I want to see this job through. But I’ll come tomorrow, right enough. Oh, I’d rather come and have a chat with you than—than do anything else, I verily believe. Yes, I would. You mean a lot to me, Rupert, more than you know.’
“不，”杰拉尔德用胳膊搭着另一个人的肩膀，哄骗地说。 “非常感谢，鲁珀特——如果可以的话，我很高兴明天能来。你明白，不是吗？我想完成这项工作。但我明天会来，没错。哦，我宁愿过来和你聊聊，也不愿做任何其他事情，我坚信。是的，我会。鲁珀特，你对我来说意义重大，比你想象的还要重要。

‘What do I mean, more than I know?’ asked Birkin irritably. He was acutely aware of Gerald’s hand on his shoulder. And he did not want this altercation. He wanted the other man to come out of the ugly misery.
“我的意思是什么，比我知道的还要多？”伯金恼怒地问道。他敏锐地意识到杰拉尔德的手放在他的肩膀上。他不想发生这种争吵。他希望另一个人能够摆脱丑陋的痛苦。

‘I’ll tell you another time,’ said Gerald coaxingly.
“我下次再告诉你。”杰拉德哄骗地说。

‘Come along with me now—I want you to come,’ said Birkin.
“现在跟我来吧——我希望你也来，”伯金说。

There was a pause, intense and real. Birkin wondered why his own heart beat so heavily. Then Gerald’s fingers gripped hard and communicative into Birkin’s shoulder, as he said:
停顿了一下，紧张而真实。伯金想知道为什么自己的心跳得这么厉害。然后杰拉尔德的手指用力地握住伯金的肩膀，说道：

‘No, I’ll see this job through, Rupert. Thank you—I know what you mean. We’re all right, you know, you and me.’
“不，我会完成这项工作，鲁珀特。谢谢你——我知道你的意思。我们都很好，你知道，你和我。”

‘I may be all right, but I’m sure you’re not, mucking about here,’ said Birkin. And he went away.
“我可能没事，但我确信你不会，在这里胡闹，”伯金说。然后他就走了。

The bodies of the dead were not recovered till towards dawn. Diana had her arms tight round the neck of the young man, choking him.
直到黎明时分，死者的尸体才被找到。戴安娜用双臂紧紧搂住年轻人的脖子，让他窒息。

‘She killed him,’ said Gerald.
“她杀了他，”杰拉尔德说。

The moon sloped down the sky and sank at last. The lake was sunk to quarter size, it had horrible raw banks of clay, that smelled of raw rottenish water. Dawn roused faintly behind the eastern hill. The water still boomed through the sluice.
月亮从天上斜落下来，最后沉了下去。湖水沉到了四分之一大小，里面有可怕的原始粘土堤岸，散发着原始腐烂水的气味。东山后面，黎明微弱地醒来。水仍然从水闸中汹涌而过。

As the birds were whistling for the first morning, and the hills at the back of the desolate lake stood radiant with the new mists, there was a straggling procession up to Shortlands, men bearing the bodies on a stretcher, Gerald going beside them, the two grey-bearded fathers following in silence. Indoors the family was all sitting up, waiting. Somebody must go to tell the mother, in her room. The doctor in secret struggled to bring back his son, till he himself was exhausted.
第一天早晨，当鸟儿在鸣叫，荒凉的湖后的山丘在新的薄雾中闪闪发光时，一支零散的队伍向肖特兰出发，人们用担架抬着尸体，杰拉德走在他们旁边，两位白胡子父亲默默地跟在后面。屋里一家人都坐着等待。必须有人去告诉母亲，在她的房间里。医生暗中奋力将儿子带回来，直到他自己也筋疲力尽。

Over all the outlying district was a hush of dreadful excitement on that Sunday morning. The colliery people felt as if this catastrophe had happened directly to themselves, indeed they were more shocked and frightened than if their own men had been killed. Such a tragedy in Shortlands, the high home of the district! One of the young mistresses, persisting in dancing on the cabin roof of the launch, wilful young madam, drowned in the midst of the festival, with the young doctor! Everywhere on the Sunday morning, the colliers wandered about, discussing the calamity. At all the Sunday dinners of the people, there seemed a strange presence. It was as if the angel of death were very near, there was a sense of the supernatural in the air. The men had excited, startled faces, the women looked solemn, some of them had been crying. The children enjoyed the excitement at first. There was an intensity in the air, almost magical. Did all enjoy it? Did all enjoy the thrill?
那个周日的早晨，整个边远地区都笼罩在一片令人恐惧的兴奋之中。煤矿人感觉这场灾难就好像直接发生在自己身上一样，确实比自己的人被杀还要震惊和恐惧。肖特兰地区的豪宅竟然发生了这样的悲剧！一位年轻的情妇，坚持在汽艇的船舱顶上跳舞，任性的少夫人，和年轻的医生一起淹死在节日之中！周日早上，煤矿工人四处走动，讨论这场灾难。在人们所有的周日晚宴上，似乎都有一个奇怪的存在。仿佛死亡天使就在眼前，空气中弥漫着一种超自然的感觉。男人们满脸兴奋、惊讶，女人们则表情严肃，有的还哭了。孩子们一开始很享受这种兴奋。空气中弥漫着一种近乎神奇的强度。大家都享受到了吗？大家都享受到刺激了吗？

Gudrun had wild ideas of rushing to comfort Gerald. She was thinking all the time of the perfect comforting, reassuring thing to say to him. She was shocked and frightened, but she put that away, thinking of how she should deport herself with Gerald: act her part. That was the real thrill: how she should act her part.
古德伦突发奇想，想要冲过去安慰杰拉德。她一直在想对他说些什么最能安慰、放心的话。她感到震惊和害怕，但她把这些抛在了脑后，想着她应该如何与杰拉尔德相处：扮演她的角色。这才是真正令人兴奋的地方：她应该如何扮演自己的角色。

Ursula was deeply and passionately in love with Birkin, and she was capable of nothing. She was perfectly callous about all the talk of the accident, but her estranged air looked like trouble. She merely sat by herself, whenever she could, and longed to see him again. She wanted him to come to the house,—she would not have it otherwise, he must come at once. She was waiting for him. She stayed indoors all day, waiting for him to knock at the door. Every minute, she glanced automatically at the window. He would be there.
乌苏拉深深地、热烈地爱着伯金，但她却无能为力。她对所有关于事故的讨论都表现得麻木不仁，但她疏远的神情看起来像是麻烦。只要有机会，她只是独自坐在一旁，渴望再次见到他。她要他到家里来——否则她不会接受的，他必须马上来。她在等他。她一整天都待在家里，等着他敲门。每一分钟，她都会不自觉地看向窗户。他会在那里。

CHAPTER XV
第十五章

SUNDAY EVENING
周日晚上

As the day wore on, the life-blood seemed to ebb away from Ursula, and within the emptiness a heavy despair gathered. Her passion seemed to bleed to death, and there was nothing. She sat suspended in a state of complete nullity, harder to bear than death.
随着时间一天天过去，乌苏拉的生命力似乎正在消退，空虚之中，一种沉重的绝望在聚集。她的热情仿佛流血而死，什么也没有了。她悬浮在一种完全虚无的状态中，比死亡更难以忍受。

‘Unless something happens,’ she said to herself, in the perfect lucidity of final suffering, ‘I shall die. I am at the end of my line of life.’
“除非发生什么事，”她在最后的痛苦中完全清醒地对自己说，“我会死。”我已经走到生命的尽头了。

She sat crushed and obliterated in a darkness that was the border of death. She realised how all her life she had been drawing nearer and nearer to this brink, where there was no beyond, from which one had to leap like Sappho into the unknown. The knowledge of the imminence of death was like a drug. Darkly, without thinking at all, she knew that she was near to death. She had travelled all her life along the line of fulfilment, and it was nearly concluded. She knew all she had to know, she had experienced all she had to experience, she was fulfilled in a kind of bitter ripeness, there remained only to fall from the tree into death. And one must fulfil one’s development to the end, must carry the adventure to its conclusion. And the next step was over the border into death. So it was then! There was a certain peace in the knowledge.
她坐在死亡边缘的黑暗中，被压垮了。她意识到她的一生是如何越来越接近这个边缘的，那里没有超越，从那里一个人必须像萨福一样跳入未知。死亡迫在眉睫的认知就像毒品一样。黑暗中，不假思索，她就知道自己已经快要死了。她一生都在沿着圆满的道路前行，现在已经快要结束了。她知道了她必须知道的一切，她经历了她必须经历的一切，她在一种苦涩的成熟中得到了满足，剩下的只有从树上坠落而死。而一个人必须将自己的发展进行到底，必须将冒险进行到底。下一步就是越过边界进入死亡。那时就是这样！知识中有一定的平安。

After all, when one was fulfilled, one was happiest in falling into death, as a bitter fruit plunges in its ripeness downwards. Death is a great consummation, a consummating experience. It is a development from life. That we know, while we are yet living. What then need we think for further? One can never see beyond the consummation. It is enough that death is a great and conclusive experience. Why should we ask what comes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us? Let us die, since the great experience is the one that follows now upon all the rest, death, which is the next great crisis in front of which we have arrived. If we wait, if we baulk the issue, we do but hang about the gates in undignified uneasiness. There it is, in front of us, as in front of Sappho, the illimitable space. Thereinto goes the journey. Have we not the courage to go on with our journey, must we cry ‘I daren’t’? On ahead we will go, into death, and whatever death may mean. If a man can see the next step to be taken, why should he fear the next but one? Why ask about the next but one? Of the next step we are certain. It is the step into death.
毕竟，当一个人得到满足时，最幸福的就是坠入死亡，就像一颗苦果的成熟度向下坠落。死亡是一次伟大的圆满，一次圆满的经历。这是从生活中发展出来的。当我们还活着的时候，我们就知道这一点。那我们还需要思考什么呢？一个人永远无法看到超越完美的事物。死亡是一次伟大而决定性的经历，这就足够了。当我们对体验仍然一无所知时，为什么我们要问体验之后会发生什么？让我们去死吧，因为伟大的经历是继所有其他经历之后的经历，死亡是我们面临的下一个巨大危机。如果我们等待，如果我们回避这个问题，我们就只能在门口徘徊，感到不体面的不安。它就在那里，在我们面前，就像在萨福面前一样，是无限的空间。旅程就这样开始了。难道我们没有继续前行的勇气吗，难道我们必须哭着“我不敢”吗？继续前行，我们将走向死亡，无论死亡意味着什么。如果一个人能够看到下一步要采取的行动，那么他为什么要害怕下一步呢？为什么要问下一个呢？对于下一步我们是确定的。这是迈向死亡的一步。

‘I shall die—I shall quickly die,’ said Ursula to herself, clear as if in a trance, clear, calm, and certain beyond human certainty. But somewhere behind, in the twilight, there was a bitter weeping and a hopelessness. That must not be attended to. One must go where the unfaltering spirit goes, there must be no baulking the issue, because of fear. No baulking the issue, no listening to the lesser voices. If the deepest desire be now, to go on into the unknown of death, shall one forfeit the deepest truth for one more shallow?
“我会死——我很快就会死，”乌苏拉自言自语，语气清晰，仿佛处于恍惚状态，清晰、平静、确定，超出了人类的确定性。但在身后的某个地方，在暮色中，传来一阵痛苦的哭泣和绝望。这是不应该被关注的。一个人必须以坚定不移的精神去哪里，决不能因为恐惧而回避这个问题。不要回避问题，不要倾听较小的声音。如果现在最深的愿望是继续进入未知的死亡，难道一个人会为了一个更肤浅的真理而放弃最深的真理吗？

‘Then let it end,’ she said to herself. It was a decision. It was not a question of taking one’s life—she would NEVER kill herself, that was repulsive and violent. It was a question of KNOWING the next step. And the next step led into the space of death. Did it?—or was there—?
“那就让它结束吧，”她对自己说。这是一个决定。这不是一个自杀的问题——她永远不会自杀，那是令人厌恶和暴力的。这是一个知道下一步的问题。下一步就进入了死亡空间。是吗？——或者曾经有——？

Her thoughts drifted into unconsciousness, she sat as if asleep beside the fire. And then the thought came back. The space o’ death! Could she give herself to it? Ah yes—it was a sleep. She had had enough So long she had held out; and resisted. Now was the time to relinquish, not to resist any more.
她的思绪陷入了昏迷，她坐在火边，仿佛睡着了。然后这个想法又回来了。死亡空间！她能全身心投入吗？啊，是的——那是一场睡眠。她已经受够了，她已经坚持了那么久了；并反抗。现在是放弃的时候了，而不是再抵抗了。

In a kind of spiritual trance, she yielded, she gave way, and all was dark. She could feel, within the darkness, the terrible assertion of her body, the unutterable anguish of dissolution, the only anguish that is too much, the far-off, awful nausea of dissolution set in within the body.
在一种精神恍惚中，她屈服了，她屈服了，一切都陷入了黑暗。在黑暗中，她能感觉到她身体的可怕的力量，无法言喻的溶解的痛苦，唯一的痛苦是太多的，遥远的，可怕的溶解在身体里的恶心。

‘Does the body correspond so immediately with the spirit?’ she asked herself. And she knew, with the clarity of ultimate knowledge, that the body is only one of the manifestations of the spirit, the transmutation of the integral spirit is the transmutation of the physical body as well. Unless I set my will, unless I absolve myself from the rhythm of life, fix myself and remain static, cut off from living, absolved within my own will. But better die than live mechanically a life that is a repetition of repetitions. To die is to move on with the invisible. To die is also a joy, a joy of submitting to that which is greater than the known, namely, the pure unknown. That is a joy. But to live mechanised and cut off within the motion of the will, to live as an entity absolved from the unknown, that is shameful and ignominious. There is no ignominy in death. There is complete ignominy in an unreplenished, mechanised life. Life indeed may be ignominious, shameful to the soul. But death is never a shame. Death itself, like the illimitable space, is beyond our sullying.
“身体与精神如此契合吗？”她问自己。而且她以究竟智的清晰知道，身体只是精神的表现之一，整体精神的嬗变也是肉身的嬗变。除非我设定了自己的意志，除非我将自己从生活的节奏中解放出来，固定自己并保持静止，与生活隔绝，在自己的意志中得到解放。但与其机械地过着不断重复的生活，不如死去。死亡就是继续与无形的事物相处。死亡也是一种快乐，一种屈服于比已知更伟大的事物（即纯粹的未知）的快乐。那是一种喜悦。但机械化地生活，在意志的运动中被切断，作为一个摆脱未知的实体而生活，那就是可耻和可耻的。死亡并没有什么耻辱。缺乏补充的机械化生活是完全的耻辱。生活确实可能是不光彩的，对灵魂来说是可耻的。但死亡从来都不是耻辱。死亡本身就像无边无际的空间一样，是我们无法玷污的。

Tomorrow was Monday. Monday, the beginning of another school-week! Another shameful, barren school-week, mere routine and mechanical activity. Was not the adventure of death infinitely preferable? Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life? A life of barren routine, without inner meaning, without any real significance. How sordid life was, how it was a terrible shame to the soul, to live now! How much cleaner and more dignified to be dead! One could not bear any more of this shame of sordid routine and mechanical nullity. One might come to fruit in death. She had had enough. For where was life to be found? No flowers grow upon busy machinery, there is no sky to a routine, there is no space to a rotary motion. And all life was a rotary motion, mechanised, cut off from reality. There was nothing to look for from life—it was the same in all countries and all peoples. The only window was death. One could look out on to the great dark sky of death with elation, as one had looked out of the classroom window as a child, and seen perfect freedom in the outside. Now one was not a child, and one knew that the soul was a prisoner within this sordid vast edifice of life, and there was no escape, save in death.
明天是星期一。星期一，又一个学周的开始！又是一个可耻的、贫瘠的学校周，仅仅是例行公事和机械的活动。死亡的冒险不是更可取吗？难道死亡不是比这样的生命更加可爱和高贵吗？平淡无奇的生活，没有内在的意义，没有任何真正的意义。现在的生活是多么肮脏，对灵魂来说是多么可怕的耻辱！死得多么干净、多么有尊严啊！人们无法再忍受这种肮脏的例行公事和机械的无效性的耻辱。一个人可能会在死亡中结出果实。她已经受够了。哪里可以找到生命呢？忙碌的机器上没有花朵生长，例行公事没有天空，旋转运动没有空间。所有的生命都是机械化的旋转运动，与现实隔绝。生活没什么可追求的——所有国家、所有民族都一样。唯一的窗口就是死亡。人们可以兴高采烈地眺望死亡的巨大黑暗天空，就像小时候从教室窗外望去，看到外面完全的自由一样。现在，我们已经不是孩子了，我们知道，灵魂是这座肮脏的生命大厦中的囚徒，除了死亡之外，别无出路。

But what a joy! What a gladness to think that whatever humanity did, it could not seize hold of the kingdom of death, to nullify that. The sea they turned into a murderous alley and a soiled road of commerce, disputed like the dirty land of a city every inch of it. The air they claimed too, shared it up, parcelled it out to certain owners, they trespassed in the air to fight for it. Everything was gone, walled in, with spikes on top of the walls, and one must ignominiously creep between the spiky walls through a labyrinth of life.
但这是多么令人高兴啊！想到无论人类做什么，它都无法抓住死亡王国，使之无效，这是多么令人高兴啊。他们把大海变成了杀戮的小巷和肮脏的商路，每一寸都像城市的肮脏土地一样存在争议。他们也索要空气，分享它，分配给某些所有者，他们侵入空气来争夺它。一切都消失了，被围起来了，墙顶上长满了尖刺，人们必须在尖刺的墙壁之间可耻地爬行，穿过生命的迷宫。

But the great, dark, illimitable kingdom of death, there humanity was put to scorn. So much they could do upon earth, the multifarious little gods that they were. But the kingdom of death put them all to scorn, they dwindled into their true vulgar silliness in face of it.
但在伟大、黑暗、无边无际的死亡王国里，人类受到了蔑视。他们在地球上能做的事情太多了，他们就是形形色色的小神。但死亡国度却让他们都受到了蔑视，他们在死亡国度面前沦为真正的庸俗愚蠢。

How beautiful, how grand and perfect death was, how good to look forward to. There one would wash off all the lies and ignominy and dirt that had been put upon one here, a perfect bath of cleanness and glad refreshment, and go unknown, unquestioned, unabased. After all, one was rich, if only in the promise of perfect death. It was a gladness above all, that this remained to look forward to, the pure inhuman otherness of death.
死亡是多么美丽，多么伟大，多么完美，多么美好，多么值得期待。在那里，人们可以洗掉在这里加诸于人身上的所有谎言、耻辱和污垢，洗去一场完美的洁净和令人愉快的清爽的沐浴，然后变得不为人知、毫无疑问、毫无根据。毕竟，一个人是富有的，哪怕只是保证完美的死亡。最令人高兴的是，死亡的纯粹非人性的差异性仍然值得期待。

Whatever life might be, it could not take away death, the inhuman transcendent death. Oh, let us ask no question of it, what it is or is not. To know is human, and in death we do not know, we are not human. And the joy of this compensates for all the bitterness of knowledge and the sordidness of our humanity. In death we shall not be human, and we shall not know. The promise of this is our heritage, we look forward like heirs to their majority.
无论生命是什么，它都无法带走死亡，无法带走非人的超越死亡。哦，我们不要问它是什么或不是什么。人类有认识，而死亡后我们就不知道，我们就不是人类。而这种快乐弥补了知识的辛酸和人性的肮脏。死亡后我们就不再是人类，我们也不会知道。这是我们的遗产，我们像大多数人的继承人一样期待着这一点。

Ursula sat quite still and quite forgotten, alone by the fire in the drawing-room. The children were playing in the kitchen, all the others were gone to church. And she was gone into the ultimate darkness of her own soul.
乌苏拉一动不动地坐在客厅的火边，完全被遗忘了。孩子们在厨房里玩耍，其他人都去了教堂。而她也陷入了自己灵魂的终极黑暗之中。

She was startled by hearing the bell ring, away in the kitchen, the children came scudding along the passage in delicious alarm.
厨房里的铃声响起，她吓了一跳，孩子们沿着过道惊慌地跑过来。

‘Ursula, there’s somebody.’
“乌苏拉，有人。”

‘I know. Don’t be silly,’ she replied. She too was startled, almost frightened. She dared hardly go to the door.
'我知道。别傻了，”她回答道。她也吃了一惊，几乎被吓坏了。她几乎不敢走到门口。

Birkin stood on the threshold, his rain-coat turned up to his ears. He had come now, now she was gone far away. She was aware of the rainy night behind him.
伯金站在门槛上，雨衣翻到耳边。他来了，她却走远了。她知道他身后的雨夜。

‘Oh is it you?’ she said.
“哦，是你吗？”她说。

‘I am glad you are at home,’ he said in a low voice, entering the house.
“我很高兴你在家，”他走进屋子，低声说道。

‘They are all gone to church.’
“他们都去了教堂。”

He took off his coat and hung it up. The children were peeping at him round the corner.
他脱下外套并挂起来。孩子们在拐角处偷看他。

‘Go and get undressed now, Billy and Dora,’ said Ursula. ‘Mother will be back soon, and she’ll be disappointed if you’re not in bed.’
“现在去脱衣服吧，比利和朵拉，”乌苏拉说。 “妈妈很快就会回来，如果你不在床上，她会很失望。”

The children, in a sudden angelic mood, retired without a word. Birkin and Ursula went into the drawing-room.
孩子们突然带着天使般的心情，一言不发地退了出去。伯金和乌苏拉走进客厅。

The fire burned low. He looked at her and wondered at the luminous delicacy of her beauty, and the wide shining of her eyes. He watched from a distance, with wonder in his heart, she seemed transfigured with light.
火烧得很小。他看着她，惊叹于她美丽的光芒和她那双闪闪发亮的眼睛。他远远地看着，心里惊叹不已，她仿佛焕发了光彩。

‘What have you been doing all day?’ he asked her.
“你一整天都在做什么？”他问她。

‘Only sitting about,’ she said.
“只是坐着，”她说。

He looked at her. There was a change in her. But she was separate from him. She remained apart, in a kind of brightness. They both sat silent in the soft light of the lamp. He felt he ought to go away again, he ought not to have come. Still he did not gather enough resolution to move. But he was DE TROP, her mood was absent and separate.
他看着她。她身上发生了变化。但她和他是分开的。她保持着距离，带着一种明亮的光芒。柔和的灯光下，两人一言不发。他觉得他应该再次离开，他不应该来。但他仍然没有下定决心采取行动。但他是德特罗普，她的心情是心不在焉、分离的。

Then there came the voices of the two children calling shyly outside the door, softly, with self-excited timidity:
这时门外传来了两个孩子害羞的叫声，轻声细语，带着自激的胆怯：

‘Ursula! Ursula!’
乌苏拉！乌苏拉！’

She rose and opened the door. On the threshold stood the two children in their long nightgowns, with wide-eyed, angelic faces. They were being very good for the moment, playing the role perfectly of two obedient children.
她站起来打开门。门口站着两个穿着长睡衣的孩子，有着天使般的大眼睛。他们现在表现得很好，完美地扮演了两个听话的孩子的角色。

‘Shall you take us to bed!’ said Billy, in a loud whisper.
“你能带我们去睡觉吗？”比利大声低声说道。

‘Why you ARE angels tonight,’ she said softly. ‘Won’t you come and say good-night to Mr Birkin?’
“为什么今晚你们都是天使，”她轻声说道。 “你不来跟伯金先生道晚安吗？”

The children merged shyly into the room, on bare feet. Billy’s face was wide and grinning, but there was a great solemnity of being good in his round blue eyes. Dora, peeping from the floss of her fair hair, hung back like some tiny Dryad, that has no soul.
孩子们赤着脚，羞涩地融入房间。比利的脸宽得大大的，咧着嘴笑，但他那双圆圆的蓝眼睛里却流露出一种善良的庄严。朵拉从她金发的牙线中偷看，像一个没有灵魂的小树妖一样向后仰着。

‘Will you say good-night to me?’ asked Birkin, in a voice that was strangely soft and smooth. Dora drifted away at once, like a leaf lifted on a breath of wind. But Billy went softly forward, slow and willing, lifting his pinched-up mouth implicitly to be kissed. Ursula watched the full, gathered lips of the man gently touch those of the boy, so gently. Then Birkin lifted his fingers and touched the boy’s round, confiding cheek, with a faint touch of love. Neither spoke. Billy seemed angelic like a cherub boy, or like an acolyte, Birkin was a tall, grave angel looking down to him.
“你能跟我说晚安吗？”伯金问道，声音出奇地柔和而流畅。朵拉立刻飘走了，就像一片被风吹起的树叶。但比利轻轻地向前走去，缓慢而心甘情愿，含蓄地抬起紧闭的嘴等待被吻。乌苏拉看着男人丰润的嘴唇轻轻地触碰着男孩的嘴唇，如此温柔。然后伯金抬起手指，抚摸着男孩圆润、充满信任的脸颊，带着淡淡的爱意。两人都没说话。比利看起来像个天使般的小天使，或者像一个助手，伯金则是一个高大、严肃的天使，俯视着他。

‘Are you going to be kissed?’ Ursula broke in, speaking to the little girl. But Dora edged away like a tiny Dryad that will not be touched.
“你会被吻吗？”乌苏拉插嘴对小女孩说道。但朵拉却像一头不肯碰触的小树妖一样慢慢地走开。

‘Won’t you say good-night to Mr Birkin? Go, he’s waiting for you,’ said Ursula. But the girl-child only made a little motion away from him.
“你不向伯金先生道晚安吗？”走吧，他在等你。”乌苏拉说。但女孩只是做了一个稍微离开他的动作。

‘Silly Dora, silly Dora!’ said Ursula.
“愚蠢的朵拉，愚蠢的朵拉！”乌苏拉说。

Birkin felt some mistrust and antagonism in the small child. He could not understand it.
伯金对这个小孩子感到有些不信任和敌意。他无法理解。

‘Come then,’ said Ursula. ‘Let us go before mother comes.’
“那就来吧，”乌苏拉说。 “我们在妈妈来之前走吧。”

‘Who’ll hear us say our prayers?’ asked Billy anxiously.
“谁会听到我们祈祷？”比利焦急地问。

‘Whom you like.’
“你喜欢谁。”

‘Won’t you?’
“你不会吗？”

‘Yes, I will.’
'是的，我会。'

‘Ursula?’
“乌苏拉？”

‘Well Billy?’
“比利呢？”

‘Is it WHOM you like?’
“这是你喜欢的人吗？”

‘That’s it.’
'就是这样。'

‘Well what is WHOM?’
“那谁是谁？”

‘It’s the accusative of who.’
“这是谁的宾格。”

There was a moment’s contemplative silence, then the confiding:
一阵沉思的沉默，然后是倾诉：

‘Is it?’
'是吗？'

Birkin smiled to himself as he sat by the fire. When Ursula came down he sat motionless, with his arms on his knees. She saw him, how he was motionless and ageless, like some crouching idol, some image of a deathly religion. He looked round at her, and his face, very pale and unreal, seemed to gleam with a whiteness almost phosphorescent.
伯金坐在火边，暗自微笑。当乌苏拉下来时，他一动不动地坐着，双臂放在膝盖上。她看到了他，他一动不动，没有年龄，就像某个蹲伏的偶像，某种死亡宗教的形象。他回头看着她，他的脸苍白而虚幻，似乎闪着磷光般的白光。

‘Don’t you feel well?’ she asked, in indefinable repulsion.
“你不舒服吗？”她带着难以言表的厌恶问道。

‘I hadn’t thought about it.’
“我没有想过。”

‘But don’t you know without thinking about it?’
“但是你不想想就知道吗？”

He looked at her, his eyes dark and swift, and he saw her revulsion. He did not answer her question.
他看着她，双眸漆黑而锐利，他看到了她的厌恶。他没有回答她的问题。

‘Don’t you know whether you are unwell or not, without thinking about it?’ she persisted.
“难道你不假思索就知道自己是否不舒服吗？”她坚持道。

‘Not always,’ he said coldly.
“并不总是如此，”他冷冷地说。

‘But don’t you think that’s very wicked?’
“但是你不觉得这很邪恶吗？”

‘Wicked?’
'邪恶？'

‘Yes. I think it’s CRIMINAL to have so little connection with your own body that you don’t even know when you are ill.’
'是的。我认为与自己的身体联系如此之少，以至于你甚至不知道自己什么时候生病了，这是犯罪行为。

He looked at her darkly.
他阴沉地看着她。

‘Yes,’ he said.
“是的，”他说。

‘Why don’t you stay in bed when you are seedy? You look perfectly ghastly.’
‘你脏兮兮的时候为什么不躺在床上呢？你看起来非常可怕。

‘Offensively so?’ he asked ironically.
“进攻如此？”他讽刺地问道。

‘Yes, quite offensive. Quite repelling.’
‘是的，相当令人反感。相当令人反感。

‘Ah!! Well that’s unfortunate.’
'啊！！嗯，这很不幸。

‘And it’s raining, and it’s a horrible night. Really, you shouldn’t be forgiven for treating your body like it—you OUGHT to suffer, a man who takes as little notice of his body as that.’
“而且正在下雨，这是一个可怕的夜晚。真的，你这样对待自己的身体不应该被原谅——你应该受苦，一个不关心自己身体的人。”

‘—takes as little notice of his body as that,’ he echoed mechanically.
“——根本不关心自己的身体，”他机械地重复道。

This cut her short, and there was silence.
这句话打断了她的话，现场一片寂静。

The others came in from church, and the two had the girls to face, then the mother and Gudrun, and then the father and the boy.
其他人从教堂进来，两人面对的是女孩们，然后是母亲和古德伦，然后是父亲和男孩。

‘Good-evening,’ said Brangwen, faintly surprised. ‘Came to see me, did you?’
“晚上好，”布兰文有点惊讶地说。 “你来看我了，是吗？”

‘No,’ said Birkin, ‘not about anything, in particular, that is. The day was dismal, and I thought you wouldn’t mind if I called in.’
“不，”伯金说，“具体来说，不是关于任何事情。”那天天气阴郁，我想如果我打电话过来你不会介意的。

‘It HAS been a depressing day,’ said Mrs Brangwen sympathetically. At that moment the voices of the children were heard calling from upstairs: ‘Mother! Mother!’ She lifted her face and answered mildly into the distance: ‘I shall come up to you in a minute, Doysie.’ Then to Birkin: ‘There is nothing fresh at Shortlands, I suppose? Ah,’ she sighed, ‘no, poor things, I should think not.’
“这是令人沮丧的一天，”布兰文夫人同情地说。就在这时，楼上传来孩子们的呼唤声：“妈妈！妈妈！”她抬起头，对着远处温和地回答道：“多伊西，我一会儿就到你那里去。”然后对伯金说：“我想，肖特兰兹没什么新鲜的吧？啊，”她叹了口气，“不，可怜的东西，我不这么认为。”

‘You’ve been over there today, I suppose?’ asked the father.
“我想你今天去过那里吧？”父亲问道。

‘Gerald came round to tea with me, and I walked back with him. The house is overexcited and unwholesome, I thought.’
“杰拉德过来和我一起喝茶，我和他一起走回去。我想，这栋房子太热闹了，不健康。”

‘I should think they were people who hadn’t much restraint,’ said Gudrun.
“我认为他们是没有太多克制的人，”古德伦说。

‘Or too much,’ Birkin answered.
“或者太多了，”伯金回答道。

‘Oh yes, I’m sure,’ said Gudrun, almost vindictively, ‘one or the other.’
“哦，是的，我确信，”古德伦几乎是怀恨在心地说，“要么是其中之一。”

‘They all feel they ought to behave in some unnatural fashion,’ said Birkin. ‘When people are in grief, they would do better to cover their faces and keep in retirement, as in the old days.’
“他们都觉得自己应该表现得不自然，”伯金说。 “当人们处于悲伤之中时，他们最好像过去一样遮住脸，享受退休生活。”

‘Certainly!’ cried Gudrun, flushed and inflammable. ‘What can be worse than this public grief—what is more horrible, more false! If GRIEF is not private, and hidden, what is?’
“当然！”古德伦喊道，脸色通红，火冒三丈。 “还有什么比这种公众悲痛更糟糕的事情——更可怕、更虚假的事情！”如果悲伤不是私人的、隐藏的，那什么才是呢？

‘Exactly,’ he said. ‘I felt ashamed when I was there and they were all going about in a lugubrious false way, feeling they must not be natural or ordinary.’
“完全正确，”他说。 “当我在那里时，我感到羞愧，他们都以一种可悲的虚假方式四处走动，感觉他们一定不自然或平凡。”

‘Well—‘ said Mrs Brangwen, offended at this criticism, ‘it isn’t so easy to bear a trouble like that.’
“嗯——”布兰文夫人对这种批评感到生气，说道，“承受这样的麻烦可不是那么容易的事。”

And she went upstairs to the children.
然后她就上楼到孩子们身边。

He remained only a few minutes longer, then took his leave. When he was gone Ursula felt such a poignant hatred of him, that all her brain seemed turned into a sharp crystal of fine hatred. Her whole nature seemed sharpened and intensified into a pure dart of hate. She could not imagine what it was. It merely took hold of her, the most poignant and ultimate hatred, pure and clear and beyond thought. She could not think of it at all, she was translated beyond herself. It was like a possession. She felt she was possessed. And for several days she went about possessed by this exquisite force of hatred against him. It surpassed anything she had ever known before, it seemed to throw her out of the world into some terrible region where nothing of her old life held good. She was quite lost and dazed, really dead to her own life.
他只多待了几分钟，然后就离开了。他走后，乌苏拉对他产生了强烈的仇恨，她的整个大脑似乎都变成了尖锐的仇恨水晶。她的整个本性似乎变得尖锐和强化，变成了纯粹的仇恨之箭。她无法想象那是什么。它只是抓住了她，最尖锐、最终极的仇恨，纯粹、清晰、超乎想象。她根本想不到，她被超越了自己。这就像一种财产。她感觉自己被附身了。一连几天，她都被这种对他的强烈仇恨所占据。它超越了她以前所知道的一切，似乎把她从这个世界扔到了一个可怕的地方，在那里她的旧生活不再有任何好处。她非常迷失和茫然，对自己的生活已经死了。

It was so completely incomprehensible and irrational. She did not know WHY she hated him, her hate was quite abstract. She had only realised with a shock that stunned her, that she was overcome by this pure transportation. He was the enemy, fine as a diamond, and as hard and jewel-like, the quintessence of all that was inimical.
这是完全不可理解和不合理的。她不知道自己为什么恨他，她的恨很抽象。她震惊地意识到，自己已经被这种纯粹的感动所征服了。他是敌人，像钻石一样精致，像宝石一样坚硬，是所有敌意的精髓。

She thought of his face, white and purely wrought, and of his eyes that had such a dark, constant will of assertion, and she touched her own forehead, to feel if she were mad, she was so transfigured in white flame of essential hate.
她想起他的脸，洁白而纯粹，想起他的眼睛，那双眼睛里有一种黑暗、坚定的意志，她摸了摸自己的额头，感觉自己是否疯了，她在本质上的仇恨的白色火焰中变得如此变形。 。

It was not temporal, her hatred, she did not hate him for this or for that; she did not want to do anything to him, to have any connection with him. Her relation was ultimate and utterly beyond words, the hate was so pure and gemlike. It was as if he were a beam of essential enmity, a beam of light that did not only destroy her, but denied her altogether, revoked her whole world. She saw him as a clear stroke of uttermost contradiction, a strange gem-like being whose existence defined her own non-existence. When she heard he was ill again, her hatred only intensified itself a few degrees, if that were possible. It stunned her and annihilated her, but she could not escape it. She could not escape this transfiguration of hatred that had come upon her.
她的仇恨不是暂时的，她不是因为这个或那个而恨他；她的仇恨不是暂时的。她不想对他做什么，不想和他有任何联系。她的关系是终极的、完全无法言语的，仇恨是那么纯粹、宝石般。仿佛他是一束本质上的敌意，一束光不仅摧毁了她，而且彻底否定了她，撤销了她的整个世界。在她看来，他是一种极度矛盾的鲜明表现，是一个奇怪的宝石般的存在，他的存在定义了她自己的不存在。当她听说他又病了时，如果可能的话，她的仇恨只增强了几度。它震惊了她，也毁灭了她，但她却无法逃脱。她无法逃脱这种降临在她身上的仇恨的变形。

CHAPTER XVI
第十六章

MAN TO MAN
人对人

He lay sick and unmoved, in pure opposition to everything. He knew how near to breaking was the vessel that held his life. He knew also how strong and durable it was. And he did not care. Better a thousand times take one’s chance with death, than accept a life one did not want. But best of all to persist and persist and persist for ever, till one were satisfied in life.
他病重地躺着，无动于衷，完全反对一切。他知道支撑着他生命的容器已经濒临破裂。他也知道它有多么坚固和耐用。但他不在乎。与其接受一个人不想要的生活，不如冒着死亡的危险一千次。但最重要的是坚持、坚持、永远坚持，直到对生活感到满意为止。

He knew that Ursula was referred back to him. He knew his life rested with her. But he would rather not live than accept the love she proffered. The old way of love seemed a dreadful bondage, a sort of conscription. What it was in him he did not know, but the thought of love, marriage, and children, and a life lived together, in the horrible privacy of domestic and connubial satisfaction, was repulsive. He wanted something clearer, more open, cooler, as it were. The hot narrow intimacy between man and wife was abhorrent. The way they shut their doors, these married people, and shut themselves in to their own exclusive alliance with each other, even in love, disgusted him. It was a whole community of mistrustful couples insulated in private houses or private rooms, always in couples, and no further life, no further immediate, no disinterested relationship admitted: a kaleidoscope of couples, disjoined, separatist, meaningless entities of married couples. True, he hated promiscuity even worse than marriage, and a liaison was only another kind of coupling, reactionary from the legal marriage. Reaction was a greater bore than action.
他知道乌苏拉被转回给他。他知道他的生命由她决定。但他宁愿死也不愿接受她所给予的爱。旧的爱情方式似乎是一种可怕的束缚，一种征兵。他不知道他身上有什么，但一想到爱情、婚姻、孩子，以及在家庭和夫妻满足的可怕隐私中共同生活的想法，就令人厌恶。他想要一些更清晰、更开放、更酷的东西。男人和妻子之间的热烈而狭隘的亲密关系是令人厌恶的。他们关起门来，这些已婚人士，将自己封闭在彼此之间的排他联盟中，即使是在爱情中，也让他感到恶心。这是一个由不信任的夫妇组成的整个社区，他们被隔离在私人住宅或私人房间里，总是情侣在一起，没有进一步的生活，没有进一步的直接的，没有无私的关系被承认：一个万花筒般的夫妇，脱节的，分离主义的，毫无意义的已婚夫妇实体。诚然，他对乱交的憎恶比婚姻更甚，而私通只是另一种结合，是对合法婚姻的反动。反应比行动更令人厌烦。

On the whole, he hated sex, it was such a limitation. It was sex that turned a man into a broken half of a couple, the woman into the other broken half. And he wanted to be single in himself, the woman single in herself. He wanted sex to revert to the level of the other appetites, to be regarded as a functional process, not as a fulfilment. He believed in sex marriage. But beyond this, he wanted a further conjunction, where man had being and woman had being, two pure beings, each constituting the freedom of the other, balancing each other like two poles of one force, like two angels, or two demons.
总的来说，他讨厌性，这是一种限制。正是性让男人变成了夫妻中破碎的一半，而女人变成了破碎的另一半。他想要自己保持单身，女人也想要单身。他希望性能够恢复到其他欲望的水平，被视为一种功能性过程，而不是一种满足。他相信性婚姻。但除此之外，他想要进一步的结合，男人有存在，女人有存在，两个纯粹的存在，每个人都构成另一个人的自由，像一种力量的两极一​​样相互平衡，就像两个天使或两个恶魔。

He wanted so much to be free, not under the compulsion of any need for unification, or tortured by unsatisfied desire. Desire and aspiration should find their object without all this torture, as now, in a world of plenty of water, simple thirst is inconsiderable, satisfied almost unconsciously. And he wanted to be with Ursula as free as with himself, single and clear and cool, yet balanced, polarised with her. The merging, the clutching, the mingling of love was become madly abhorrent to him.
他非常渴望自由，而不是受到任何统一需要的强迫，或者被未满足的欲望所折磨。欲望和抱负应该在没有所有这些折磨的情况下找到它们的目标，就像现在，在一个充足的水的世界中，简单的口渴是微不足道的，几乎在不知不觉中得到满足。他想和乌苏拉在一起，就像和他自己一样自由，单身，清晰，冷静，但平衡，与她两极分化。爱的融合、紧握、混合让他变得疯狂地厌恶。

But it seemed to him, woman was always so horrible and clutching, she had such a lust for possession, a greed of self-importance in love. She wanted to have, to own, to control, to be dominant. Everything must be referred back to her, to Woman, the Great Mother of everything, out of whom proceeded everything and to whom everything must finally be rendered up.
但在他看来，女人总是那么可怕，那么执着，她对占有有如此强烈的欲望，对爱情有一种自以为是的贪婪。她想要拥有、拥有、控制、统治。一切都必须回归到她，回归到女人，万物的伟大之母，一切都源于她，一切最终都必须归于她。

It filled him with almost insane fury, this calm assumption of the Magna Mater, that all was hers, because she had borne it. Man was hers because she had borne him. A Mater Dolorosa, she had borne him, a Magna Mater, she now claimed him again, soul and body, sex, meaning, and all. He had a horror of the Magna Mater, she was detestable.
圣母玛利亚平静地认为一切都是她的，因为她承受了这一切，这让他充满了近乎疯狂的愤怒。男人是她的，因为她生下了他。一位痛苦的母亲，她生下了他，一位伟大的母亲，她现在再次要求他，灵魂和身体，性，意义，等等。他对圣母感到恐惧，她是可憎的。

She was on a very high horse again, was woman, the Great Mother. Did he not know it in Hermione. Hermione, the humble, the subservient, what was she all the while but the Mater Dolorosa, in her subservience, claiming with horrible, insidious arrogance and female tyranny, her own again, claiming back the man she had borne in suffering. By her very suffering and humility she bound her son with chains, she held him her everlasting prisoner.
她再次居高临下，是女人，是伟大的母亲。他难道不知道赫敏的这一点吗？赫敏，谦逊，顺从，一直以来，她不过是痛苦圣母，在她的顺从中，以可怕的、阴险的傲慢和女性的暴政，重新夺回了她自己，夺回了她在痛苦中所生的男人。她以极大的痛苦和谦卑，用锁链束缚了她的儿子，她把他当作永远的囚犯。

And Ursula, Ursula was the same—or the inverse. She too was the awful, arrogant queen of life, as if she were a queen bee on whom all the rest depended. He saw the yellow flare in her eyes, he knew the unthinkable overweening assumption of primacy in her. She was unconscious of it herself. She was only too ready to knock her head on the ground before a man. But this was only when she was so certain of her man, that she could worship him as a woman worships her own infant, with a worship of perfect possession.
乌苏拉，乌苏拉是一样的——或者相反。她也是可怕、傲慢的生命女王，仿佛她是其余一切所依赖的蜂王。他看到她眼睛里闪烁着黄色的光芒，他知道她身上那种不可想象的傲慢自大的感觉。她自己也没有意识到这一点。她已经做好了在男人面前把头撞到地上的准备。但这只是当她对自己的男人如此确定，以至于她可以像女人崇拜自己的婴儿一样崇拜他，崇拜完美的占有。

It was intolerable, this possession at the hands of woman. Always a man must be considered as the broken off fragment of a woman, and the sex was the still aching scar of the laceration. Man must be added on to a woman, before he had any real place or wholeness.
这种财产掌握在女人手中，真是令人无法忍受。男人总是被视为女人被折断的碎片，而性则是伤口上仍然疼痛的疤痕。男人必须先附加到女人身上，然后才能拥有任何真正的地位或完整性。

And why? Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken fragments of one whole? It is not true. We are not broken fragments of one whole. Rather we are the singling away into purity and clear being, of things that were mixed. Rather the sex is that which remains in us of the mixed, the unresolved. And passion is the further separating of this mixture, that which is manly being taken into the being of the man, that which is womanly passing to the woman, till the two are clear and whole as angels, the admixture of sex in the highest sense surpassed, leaving two single beings constellated together like two stars.
为什么？为什么我们要把自己，男人和女人，视为一个整体的碎片？这不是真的。我们不是一个整体的破碎碎片。相反，我们是从混合的事物中分离出来的纯粹和清晰的存在。相反，性是留在我们身上的混合的、未解决的问题。而激情则是这种混合体的进一步分离，男性气质被纳入男人的存在，女性气质传递给女人，直到两者像天使一样清晰而完整，这是最高意义上的性的混合超越，留下两个单独的存在，像两颗星星一样排列在一起。

In the old age, before sex was, we were mixed, each one a mixture. The process of singling into individuality resulted into the great polarisation of sex. The womanly drew to one side, the manly to the other. But the separation was imperfect even them. And so our world-cycle passes. There is now to come the new day, when we are beings each of us, fulfilled in difference. The man is pure man, the woman pure woman, they are perfectly polarised. But there is no longer any of the horrible merging, mingling self-abnegation of love. There is only the pure duality of polarisation, each one free from any contamination of the other. In each, the individual is primal, sex is subordinate, but perfectly polarised. Each has a single, separate being, with its own laws. The man has his pure freedom, the woman hers. Each acknowledges the perfection of the polarised sex-circuit. Each admits the different nature in the other.
在老年时期，在性行为出现之前，我们是混合的，每个人都是混合物。个体化的过程导致了性别的巨大两极分化。女性向一侧靠拢，男性向另一侧靠拢。但即使是他们，这种分离也是不完美的。我们的世界周期就这样过去了。现在新的一天即将到来，届时我们每个人都将在差异中得到满足。男人是纯粹的男人，女人是纯粹的女人，他们是完全两极分化的。但不再有任何可怕的爱的融合、混合和自我克制。只有纯粹的极化二元性，每一者都不受另一者的任何污染。在每个人中，个人是原始的，性别是从属的，但完全两极分化。每个人都有一个单独的、独立的存在，有自己的法则。男人有他的纯粹自由，女人有她的纯粹自由。每个人都承认两极分化的性循环的完美性。每个人都承认对方有不同的本性。

So Birkin meditated whilst he was ill. He liked sometimes to be ill enough to take to his bed. For then he got better very quickly, and things came to him clear and sure.
因此伯金在生病期间进行冥想。有时他喜欢病得卧床不起。因为那时他的病情恢复得很快，事情对他来说变得清晰而确定。

Whilst he was laid up, Gerald came to see him. The two men had a deep, uneasy feeling for each other. Gerald’s eyes were quick and restless, his whole manner tense and impatient, he seemed strung up to some activity. According to conventionality, he wore black clothes, he looked formal, handsome and COMME IL FAUT. His hair was fair almost to whiteness, sharp like splinters of light, his face was keen and ruddy, his body seemed full of northern energy. Gerald really loved Birkin, though he never quite believed in him. Birkin was too unreal;—clever, whimsical, wonderful, but not practical enough. Gerald felt that his own understanding was much sounder and safer. Birkin was delightful, a wonderful spirit, but after all, not to be taken seriously, not quite to be counted as a man among men.
当他卧病在床时，杰拉尔德来看望他。两个人对彼此都有一种深深的、不安的感觉。杰拉尔德的眼神敏捷而焦躁，他的整个神情紧张而不耐烦，他似乎在忙于某种活动。按照惯例，他穿着黑色的衣服，显得正式、帅气、COMME IL FAUT。他的头发白得近乎洁白，锐利如光，面容锐利红润，浑身充满北方气息。杰拉德真的很爱柏金，尽管他从来不太相信他。 Birkin 太不真实了——聪明、异想天开、美妙，但不够实用。杰拉德觉得自己的理解更加健全和安全了。伯金是令人愉快的，是一种奇妙的精神，但毕竟不被认真对待，不完全算作男人中的男人。

‘Why are you laid up again?’ he asked kindly, taking the sick man’s hand. It was always Gerald who was protective, offering the warm shelter of his physical strength.
“你怎么又躺着了？”他握住病人的手，亲切地问道。杰拉德总是保护他，用他的体力提供温暖的庇护。

‘For my sins, I suppose,’ Birkin said, smiling a little ironically.
“我想是因为我的罪孽，”伯金说道，带着一点讽刺的微笑。

‘For your sins? Yes, probably that is so. You should sin less, and keep better in health?’
‘为了你的罪孽？是的，大概就是这样。你应该少犯罪，保持健康吗？

‘You’d better teach me.’
“你最好教我。”

He looked at Gerald with ironic eyes.
他用讽刺的眼神看着杰拉德。

‘How are things with you?’ asked Birkin.
“你怎么样？”伯金问道。

‘With me?’ Gerald looked at Birkin, saw he was serious, and a warm light came into his eyes.
“和我一起？”杰拉尔德看着伯金，见他一脸严肃，眼中闪过温暖的光芒。

‘I don’t know that they’re any different. I don’t see how they could be. There’s nothing to change.’
“我不知道它们有什么不同。我不明白他们怎么会这样。没有什么可以改变的。

‘I suppose you are conducting the business as successfully as ever, and ignoring the demand of the soul.’
“我想你的生意一如既往地成功，却忽视了灵魂的需求。”

‘That’s it,’ said Gerald. ‘At least as far as the business is concerned. I couldn’t say about the soul, I’am sure.’
“就是这样，”杰拉尔德说。 “至少就业务而言是这样。我确信我不能谈论灵魂。

‘No.’
'不。'

‘Surely you don’t expect me to?’ laughed Gerald.
“你肯定不希望我这么做吧？”杰拉尔德笑道。

‘No. How are the rest of your affairs progressing, apart from the business?’
'不。除了生意之外，你的其他事务进展如何？

‘The rest of my affairs? What are those? I couldn’t say; I don’t know what you refer to.’
‘我剩下的事？那些是什么？我不能说；我不知道你指的是什么。

‘Yes, you do,’ said Birkin. ‘Are you gloomy or cheerful? And what about Gudrun Brangwen?’
“是的，你知道，”伯金说。 ‘你是忧郁还是开朗？那么古德伦·布兰文呢？

‘What about her?’ A confused look came over Gerald. ‘Well,’ he added, ‘I don’t know. I can only tell you she gave me a hit over the face last time I saw her.’
“那她呢？”杰拉德脸上露出困惑的表情。 “嗯，”他补充道，“我不知道。”我只能告诉你，上次我见到她时，她打了我的脸。

‘A hit over the face! What for?’
‘一记重拳打在脸上！做什么的？'

‘That I couldn’t tell you, either.’
“这个我也不能告诉你。”

‘Really! But when?’
'真的吗！但当？'

‘The night of the party—when Diana was drowned. She was driving the cattle up the hill, and I went after her—you remember.’
“派对当晚——戴安娜溺水身亡。她正在赶牛上山，我追赶她——你记得吧。

‘Yes, I remember. But what made her do that? You didn’t definitely ask her for it, I suppose?’
'是的，我记得。但是什么让她这么做呢？我猜你肯定没有向她要这个吧？

‘I? No, not that I know of. I merely said to her, that it was dangerous to drive those Highland bullocks—as it IS. She turned in such a way, and said—‘I suppose you think I’m afraid of you and your cattle, don’t you?’ So I asked her ‘why,’ and for answer she flung me a back-hander across the face.’
'我？不，据我所知没有。我只是对她说，赶那些高地公牛很危险——事实上。她转过身来，说道：“我想你认为我害怕你和你的牛，不是吗？”所以我问她“为什么”，作为回答，她反手把我扔了过去。脸。

Birkin laughed quickly, as if it pleased him. Gerald looked at him, wondering, and began to laugh as well, saying:
伯金很快笑了起来，好像这让他很高兴。杰拉尔德疑惑地看着他，同时也笑了起来，说道：

‘I didn’t laugh at the time, I assure you. I was never so taken aback in my life.’
“我向你保证，我当时没有笑。我一生中从未如此惊讶过。

‘And weren’t you furious?’
“你不生气吗？”

‘Furious? I should think I was. I’d have murdered her for two pins.’
'狂怒？我应该认为我是。为了两枚别针，我会杀了她。

‘H’m!’ ejaculated Birkin. ‘Poor Gudrun, wouldn’t she suffer afterwards for having given herself away!’ He was hugely delighted.
“嗯！”伯金脱口而出。 “可怜的古珍，她不会因为暴露自己而受苦吗！”他非常高兴。

‘Would she suffer?’ asked Gerald, also amused now.
“她会受苦吗？”杰拉德问道，现在也被逗乐了。

Both men smiled in malice and amusement.
两个人都露出了恶意和有趣的微笑。

‘Badly, I should think; seeing how self-conscious she is.’
“糟糕的是，我想；看看她是多么的自我意识。”

‘She is self-conscious, is she? Then what made her do it? For I certainly think it was quite uncalled-for, and quite unjustified.’
‘她是有自我意识的，是吗？那么是什么让她这么做呢？因为我当然认为这是完全没有必要的，也是非常不合理的。

‘I suppose it was a sudden impulse.’
“我想这是一个突然的冲动。”

‘Yes, but how do you account for her having such an impulse? I’d done her no harm.’
“是的，但是你怎么解释她有这样的冲动呢？”我没有伤害她。

Birkin shook his head.
伯金摇摇头。

‘The Amazon suddenly came up in her, I suppose,’ he said.
“我想，亚马逊突然在她身上出现了，”他说。

‘Well,’ replied Gerald, ‘I’d rather it had been the Orinoco.’
“好吧，”杰拉德回答道，“我宁愿是奥里诺科河。”

They both laughed at the poor joke. Gerald was thinking how Gudrun had said she would strike the last blow too. But some reserve made him keep this back from Birkin.
他们都因为这个拙劣的笑话而笑了。杰拉德正在想古德伦说过她也会进行最后一击。但出于某种矜持，他对伯金隐瞒了这件事。

‘And you resent it?’ Birkin asked.
“你对此感到不满吗？”伯金问道。

‘I don’t resent it. I don’t care a tinker’s curse about it.’ He was silent a moment, then he added, laughing. ‘No, I’ll see it through, that’s all. She seemed sorry afterwards.’
‘我并不反感。我不在乎修补匠的咒骂。”他沉默了一会儿，然后笑着补充道。 ‘不，我会看清楚的，仅此而已。后来她似乎很抱歉。

‘Did she? You’ve not met since that night?’
‘是吗？从那天晚上起你们就再没有见过面了？

Gerald’s face clouded.
杰拉尔德的脸色阴沉起来。

‘No,’ he said. ‘We’ve been—you can imagine how it’s been, since the accident.’
“不，”他说。 “自从事故发生以来，你可以想象我们的情况如何。”

‘Yes. Is it calming down?’
'是的。平静下来了吗？

‘I don’t know. It’s a shock, of course. But I don’t believe mother minds. I really don’t believe she takes any notice. And what’s so funny, she used to be all for the children—nothing mattered, nothing whatever mattered but the children. And now, she doesn’t take any more notice than if it was one of the servants.’
'我不知道。当然，这令人震惊。但我不相信妈妈会介意。我真的不相信她会注意到。有趣的是，她过去一切都是为了孩子——什么都不重要，除了孩子什么都不重要。现在，她不会比其中一名仆人更在意。”

‘No? Did it upset YOU very much?’
'不？这让你很伤心吗？

‘It’s a shock. But I don’t feel it very much, really. I don’t feel any different. We’ve all got to die, and it doesn’t seem to make any great difference, anyhow, whether you die or not. I can’t feel any GRIEF you know. It leaves me cold. I can’t quite account for it.’
'这真是令人震惊。但我真的没有太大感觉。我不觉得有什么不同。我们都会死，而且不管死与不死，似乎都没有什么太大的区别。我感觉不到任何悲伤，你知道。这让我感到寒冷。我无法完全解释这一点。

‘You don’t care if you die or not?’ asked Birkin.
“你不在乎自己死不死？”伯金问道。

Gerald looked at him with eyes blue as the blue-fibred steel of a weapon. He felt awkward, but indifferent. As a matter of fact, he did care terribly, with a great fear.
杰拉德用蓝色的眼睛看着他，就像武器上的蓝色纤维钢一样。他感到尴尬，但又无动于衷。事实上，他确实很在意，也很害怕。

‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I don’t want to die, why should I? But I never trouble. The question doesn’t seem to be on the carpet for me at all. It doesn’t interest me, you know.’
‘哦，’他说，‘我不想死，为什么要死呢？但我从不麻烦。这个问题对我来说似乎根本不存在。你知道，我对它不感兴趣。

‘TIMOR MORTIS CONTURBAT ME,’ quoted Birkin, adding—‘No, death doesn’t really seem the point any more. It curiously doesn’t concern one. It’s like an ordinary tomorrow.’
伯金引用了“死亡帝王对我的诱惑”，并补充道：“不，死亡似乎不再是重点了。”奇怪的是，这与一个人无关。这就像一个普通的明天。”

Gerald looked closely at his friend. The eyes of the two men met, and an unspoken understanding was exchanged.
杰拉尔德仔细地看着他的朋友。两人目光交汇，产生了无言的默契。

Gerald narrowed his eyes, his face was cool and unscrupulous as he looked at Birkin, impersonally, with a vision that ended in a point in space, strangely keen-eyed and yet blind.
杰拉德眯起眼睛，一脸冷酷而肆无忌惮地看着伯金，没有人情味，视线尽头是空间中的一个点，目光奇怪地敏锐，却又盲目。

‘If death isn’t the point,’ he said, in a strangely abstract, cold, fine voice—‘what is?’ He sounded as if he had been found out.
“如果死亡不是重点，”他用一种奇怪的、抽象的、冷酷的、优美的声音说，“那什么才是重点呢？”听起来好像他已经被发现了。

‘What is?’ re-echoed Birkin. And there was a mocking silence.
“什么是？”伯金重复道。周围一片嘲讽的沉默。

‘There’s long way to go, after the point of intrinsic death, before we disappear,’ said Birkin.
伯金说：“在本质死亡之后，在我们消失之前，还有很长的路要走。”

‘There is,’ said Gerald. ‘But what sort of way?’ He seemed to press the other man for knowledge which he himself knew far better than Birkin did.
“有，”杰拉尔德说。 “但是什么样的方式呢？”他似乎在向另一个人施压，要求他了解他自己比伯金更了解的知识。

‘Right down the slopes of degeneration—mystic, universal degeneration. There are many stages of pure degradation to go through: agelong. We live on long after our death, and progressively, in progressive devolution.’
‘就在堕落的斜坡上——神秘的、普遍的堕落。纯粹的退化需要经历许多阶段：很长一段时间。我们死后很长一段时间都会继续活下去，而且会逐步权力下放。”

Gerald listened with a faint, fine smile on his face, all the time, as if, somewhere, he knew so much better than Birkin, all about this: as if his own knowledge were direct and personal, whereas Birkin’s was a matter of observation and inference, not quite hitting the nail on the head:—though aiming near enough at it. But he was not going to give himself away. If Birkin could get at the secrets, let him. Gerald would never help him. Gerald would be a dark horse to the end.
杰拉德脸上始终挂着淡淡的微笑，听着，仿佛在某个地方，他比伯金更了解这一切：仿佛他自己的知识是直接的、个人的，而伯金的知识是观察的结果和推论，虽然目标足够接近，但并没有完全击中要害。但他不打算暴露自己。如果伯金能掌握其中的秘密，那就让他来吧。杰拉德永远不会帮助他。杰拉德到最后都会成为一匹黑马。

‘Of course,’ he said, with a startling change of conversation, ‘it is father who really feels it. It will finish him. For him the world collapses. All his care now is for Winnie—he must save Winnie. He says she ought to be sent away to school, but she won’t hear of it, and he’ll never do it. Of course she IS in rather a queer way. We’re all of us curiously bad at living. We can do things—but we can’t get on with life at all. It’s curious—a family failing.’
“当然，”他说，语气发生了惊人的变化，“真正感受到的是父亲。”这将终结他。对他来说世界崩溃了。他现在唯一关心的就是温妮——他必须拯救温妮。他说应该送她去上学，但她不听，他也永远不会这么做。当然，她是以一种相当奇怪的方式。奇怪的是，我们所有人都不善于生活。我们可以做一些事情，但我们根本无法继续生活。这很奇怪——一个家庭的失败。

‘She oughtn’t to be sent away to school,’ said Birkin, who was considering a new proposition.
“她不应该被送去上学，”伯金说，他正在考虑一个新的提议。

‘She oughtn’t. Why?’
‘她不应该。为什么？'

‘She’s a queer child—a special child, more special even than you. And in my opinion special children should never be sent away to school. Only moderately ordinary children should be sent to school—so it seems to me.’
“她是一个奇怪的孩子——一个特别的孩子，甚至比你更特别。在我看来，特殊儿童永远不应该被送到学校。只有中等程度的普通孩子才应该被送去学校——在我看来是这样。

‘I’m inclined to think just the opposite. I think it would probably make her more normal if she went away and mixed with other children.’
“我倾向于认为恰恰相反。我认为如果她离开并与其他孩子混在一起，可能会让她变得更正常。

‘She wouldn’t mix, you see. YOU never really mixed, did you? And she wouldn’t be willing even to pretend to. She’s proud, and solitary, and naturally apart. If she has a single nature, why do you want to make her gregarious?’
“你看，她不会混在一起。你从来没有真正混合过，是吗？而且她连假装都不愿意。她骄傲、孤独，天生与众不同。如果她性格单一，你为什么要让她变得合群呢？

‘No, I don’t want to make her anything. But I think school would be good for her.’
“不，我不想给她做任何事。但我认为上学对她有好处。”

‘Was it good for you?’
“这对你有好处吗？”

Gerald’s eyes narrowed uglily. School had been torture to him. Yet he had not questioned whether one should go through this torture. He seemed to believe in education through subjection and torment.
杰拉尔德的眼睛丑陋地眯了起来。学校对他来说是一种折磨。但他并没有质疑一个人是否应该经历这种折磨。他似乎相信教育是通过服从和折磨来实现的。

‘I hated it at the time, but I can see it was necessary,’ he said. ‘It brought me into line a bit—and you can’t live unless you do come into line somewhere.’
“我当时讨厌它，但我知道这是必要的，”他说。 “这让我有点排队了——除非你确实在某个地方排队，否则你就无法生存。”

‘Well,’ said Birkin, ‘I begin to think that you can’t live unless you keep entirely out of the line. It’s no good trying to toe the line, when your one impulse is to smash up the line. Winnie is a special nature, and for special natures you must give a special world.’
“好吧，”伯金说，“我开始认为，除非你完全脱离规矩，否则你就无法生存。”当你的一个冲动就是破坏规则时，试图遵守规则是没有用的。温妮是一个特殊的人，对于特殊的人，你必须给予一个特殊的世界。

‘Yes, but where’s your special world?’ said Gerald.
“是的，但是你的特殊世界在哪里？”杰拉德说。

‘Make it. Instead of chopping yourself down to fit the world, chop the world down to fit yourself. As a matter of fact, two exceptional people make another world. You and I, we make another, separate world. You don’t WANT a world same as your brothers-in-law. It’s just the special quality you value. Do you WANT to be normal or ordinary! It’s a lie. You want to be free and extraordinary, in an extraordinary world of liberty.’
'做了。与其砍掉自己来适应世界，不如砍掉世界来适应自己。事实上，两个杰出的人创造了另一个世界。你和我，我们创造了另一个独立的世界。你不想要一个和你姐夫一样的世界。这正是您所看重的特殊品质。你想要平凡还是平凡！这是一个谎言。你想要在一个非凡的自由世界中获得自由和非凡。

Gerald looked at Birkin with subtle eyes of knowledge. But he would never openly admit what he felt. He knew more than Birkin, in one direction—much more. And this gave him his gentle love for the other man, as if Birkin were in some way young, innocent, child-like: so amazingly clever, but incurably innocent.
杰拉德用充满知识的微妙目光看着伯金。但他永远不会公开承认他的感受。在一个方向上，他比伯金懂得更多——多得多。这让他对另一个男人产生了温柔的爱，就好像柏金在某种程度上年轻、天真、像孩子一样：如此聪明，但又无可救药地天真。

‘Yet you are so banal as to consider me chiefly a freak,’ said Birkin pointedly.
“然而你却如此平庸，以至于认为我主要是一个怪胎，”伯金尖锐地说。

‘A freak!’ exclaimed Gerald, startled. And his face opened suddenly, as if lighted with simplicity, as when a flower opens out of the cunning bud. ‘No—I never consider you a freak.’ And he watched the other man with strange eyes, that Birkin could not understand. ‘I feel,’ Gerald continued, ‘that there is always an element of uncertainty about you—perhaps you are uncertain about yourself. But I’m never sure of you. You can go away and change as easily as if you had no soul.’
“一个怪胎！”杰拉德吃惊地喊道。他的脸突然张开，仿佛焕发着单纯的光芒，就像一朵花从狡猾的花蕾中绽放出来。 “不——我从不认为你是个怪胎。”他用伯金无法理解的奇怪眼神看着另一个人。 “我觉得，”杰拉德继续说道，“你总是有一些不确定的因素——也许你对自己也不确定。但我永远不确定你。你可以轻易地离开并改变，就好像你没有灵魂一样。

He looked at Birkin with penetrating eyes. Birkin was amazed. He thought he had all the soul in the world. He stared in amazement. And Gerald, watching, saw the amazing attractive goodliness of his eyes, a young, spontaneous goodness that attracted the other man infinitely, yet filled him with bitter chagrin, because he mistrusted it so much. He knew Birkin could do without him—could forget, and not suffer. This was always present in Gerald’s consciousness, filling him with bitter unbelief: this consciousness of the young, animal-like spontaneity of detachment. It seemed almost like hypocrisy and lying, sometimes, oh, often, on Birkin’s part, to talk so deeply and importantly.
他用锐利的目光看着伯金。伯金很惊讶。他以为他拥有了世界上所有的灵魂。他惊讶地看着。杰拉尔德看着他，看到了他眼睛里令人惊叹的迷人的善良，一种年轻的、自发的善良，无限地吸引着另一个人，但又让他感到苦涩的懊恼，因为他太不信任它了。他知道伯金可以没有他——可以忘记，而不是受苦。这始终存在于杰拉德的意识中，让他充满了痛苦的怀疑：这种年轻人的意识，动物般的自发性超然。有时候，哦，经常，对于伯金来说，如此深入而重要的谈话似乎几乎是虚伪和谎言。

Quite other things were going through Birkin’s mind. Suddenly he saw himself confronted with another problem—the problem of love and eternal conjunction between two men. Of course this was necessary—it had been a necessity inside himself all his life—to love a man purely and fully. Of course he had been loving Gerald all along, and all along denying it.
伯金的脑海中浮现出许多其他的事情。突然，他发现自己面临着另一个问题——两个男人之间的爱情和永恒结合的问题。当然，这是必要的——这是他一生中的必要——纯粹而充分地爱一个人。当然，他一直爱着杰拉尔德，但一直否认这一点。

He lay in the bed and wondered, whilst his friend sat beside him, lost in brooding. Each man was gone in his own thoughts.
他躺在床上思考着，而他的朋友坐在他旁边，陷入了沉思。每个人都沉浸在自己的思绪中。

‘You know how the old German knights used to swear a BLUTBRUDERSCHAFT,’ he said to Gerald, with quite a new happy activity in his eyes.
“你知道过去的德国骑士们是如何宣誓“BLUTBRUDERSCHAFT”的，他对杰拉尔德说道，眼中充满了新的快乐。

‘Make a little wound in their arms, and rub each other’s blood into the cut?’ said Gerald.
“在他们的手臂上划一个小伤口，然后把彼此的血擦到伤口上？”杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes—and swear to be true to each other, of one blood, all their lives. That is what we ought to do. No wounds, that is obsolete. But we ought to swear to love each other, you and I, implicitly, and perfectly, finally, without any possibility of going back on it.’
“是的——并且发誓一生忠于彼此，血统相同。”这是我们应该做的。没有伤口，那已经过时了。但我们应该发誓彼此相爱，你和我，含蓄地、完美地、最后，没有任何反悔的可能。

He looked at Gerald with clear, happy eyes of discovery. Gerald looked down at him, attracted, so deeply bondaged in fascinated attraction, that he was mistrustful, resenting the bondage, hating the attraction.
他用清澈、快乐、充满发现的目光看着杰拉德。杰拉尔德低头看着他，被吸引了，深深地被迷住的吸引力所束缚，以至于他变得不信任，憎恨这种束缚，憎恨这种吸引力。

‘We will swear to each other, one day, shall we?’ pleaded Birkin. ‘We will swear to stand by each other—be true to each other—ultimately— infallibly—given to each other, organically—without possibility of taking back.’
“有一天我们会互相发誓，好吗？”伯金恳求道。 “我们将发誓相互支持——忠于彼此——最终——无误地——有机地给予彼此——没有收回的可能性。”

Birkin sought hard to express himself. But Gerald hardly listened. His face shone with a certain luminous pleasure. He was pleased. But he kept his reserve. He held himself back.
伯金努力表达自己的想法。但杰拉尔德几乎不听。他的脸上闪烁着某种明亮的喜悦。他很高兴。但他保留了自己的保留。他忍住了。

‘Shall we swear to each other, one day?’ said Birkin, putting out his hand towards Gerald.
“有一天我们可以互相宣誓吗？”伯金向杰拉德伸出手说道。

Gerald just touched the extended fine, living hand, as if withheld and afraid.
杰拉尔德只是碰触那只伸出的纤细而有生命力的手，仿佛感到害怕和克制。

‘We’ll leave it till I understand it better,’ he said, in a voice of excuse.
“我们先把它留到我更好地理解为止，”他用一种借口的语气说道。

Birkin watched him. A little sharp disappointment, perhaps a touch of contempt came into his heart.
伯金看着他。一丝尖锐的失望，或许还有一丝轻蔑涌上心头。

‘Yes,’ he said. ‘You must tell me what you think, later. You know what I mean? Not sloppy emotionalism. An impersonal union that leaves one free.’
“是的，”他说。 ‘稍后你必须告诉我你的想法。你知道我的意思？不马虎的情感主义。这是一种客观的结合，使人获得自由。”

They lapsed both into silence. Birkin was looking at Gerald all the time. He seemed now to see, not the physical, animal man, which he usually saw in Gerald, and which usually he liked so much, but the man himself, complete, and as if fated, doomed, limited. This strange sense of fatality in Gerald, as if he were limited to one form of existence, one knowledge, one activity, a sort of fatal halfness, which to himself seemed wholeness, always overcame Birkin after their moments of passionate approach, and filled him with a sort of contempt, or boredom. It was the insistence on the limitation which so bored Birkin in Gerald. Gerald could never fly away from himself, in real indifferent gaiety. He had a clog, a sort of monomania.
他们都陷入了沉默。伯金一直看着杰拉德。他现在看到的似乎不是他通常在杰拉德身上看到的、他通常非常喜欢的肉体的、动物般的人，而是这个人本身，完整的，仿佛命中注定的、注定的、有限的。杰拉德身上的这种奇怪的宿命感，仿佛他被限制在一种存在形式、一种知识、一种活动、一种致命的一半之中，而这对他自己来说似乎是完整的，在他们热情接近的时刻之后，总是克服伯金，并充满他带着一种轻蔑，或者说无聊。正是这种对限制的坚持让杰拉尔德的伯金感到厌烦。杰拉尔德永远无法摆脱自己，带着真正的冷漠的快乐。他有一双木鞋，有点偏执。

There was silence for a time. Then Birkin said, in a lighter tone, letting the stress of the contact pass:
一时沉默。然后伯金用更轻松的语气说道：

‘Can’t you get a good governess for Winifred?—somebody exceptional?’
“你不能为威妮弗雷德找一个好的家庭教师吗？——一个特别的人？”

‘Hermione Roddice suggested we should ask Gudrun to teach her to draw and to model in clay. You know Winnie is astonishingly clever with that plasticine stuff. Hermione declares she is an artist.’ Gerald spoke in the usual animated, chatty manner, as if nothing unusual had passed. But Birkin’s manner was full of reminder.
“赫敏·罗迪斯建议我们应该请古德伦教她画画和用粘土做模特。你知道温妮对橡皮泥玩得非常聪明。赫敏宣称她是一名艺术家。”杰拉德以一贯的活泼、健谈的方式说话，仿佛没有发生任何异常的事情。但伯金的态度充满了提醒。

‘Really! I didn’t know that. Oh well then, if Gudrun WOULD teach her, it would be perfect—couldn’t be anything better—if Winifred is an artist. Because Gudrun somewhere is one. And every true artist is the salvation of every other.’
'真的吗！我不知道。哦，那么，如果古德伦愿意教她，那就完美了——再好不过了——如果温妮弗雷德是一名艺术家的话。因为古德伦在某个地方就是其中之一。每一位真正的艺术家都是其他艺术家的救赎。

‘I thought they got on so badly, as a rule.’
“一般来说，我认为他们相处得很糟糕。”

‘Perhaps. But only artists produce for each other the world that is fit to live in. If you can arrange THAT for Winifred, it is perfect.’
'也许。但只有艺术家才能为彼此创造一个适合居住的世界。如果你能为威妮弗雷德安排这个，那就完美了。

‘But you think she wouldn’t come?’
“但你认为她不会来吗？”

‘I don’t know. Gudrun is rather self-opinionated. She won’t go cheap anywhere. Or if she does, she’ll pretty soon take herself back. So whether she would condescend to do private teaching, particularly here, in Beldover, I don’t know. But it would be just the thing. Winifred has got a special nature. And if you can put into her way the means of being self-sufficient, that is the best thing possible. She’ll never get on with the ordinary life. You find it difficult enough yourself, and she is several skins thinner than you are. It is awful to think what her life will be like unless she does find a means of expression, some way of fulfilment. You can see what mere leaving it to fate brings. You can see how much marriage is to be trusted to—look at your own mother.’
'我不知道。古德伦相当固执己见。她不会去任何地方便宜。或者如果她这样做了，她很快就会收回自己的想法。因此，我不知道她是否会屈尊做私人教学，尤其是在贝尔多弗这里。但这只是事情而已。威妮弗雷德有一种特殊的性格。如果你能为她提供自给自足的方法，那是最好的事情。她永远无法过平凡的生活。你自己都觉得很难了，而且她比你还薄好几张脸皮。除非她确实找到一种表达方式、某种实现方式，否则她的生活将会是什么样子，真是太可怕了。你可以看到仅仅听天由命会带来什么。你可以看到婚姻是多么值得信赖——看看你自己的母亲。

‘Do you think mother is abnormal?’
“你觉得妈妈不正常吗？”

‘No! I think she only wanted something more, or other than the common run of life. And not getting it, she has gone wrong perhaps.’
'不！我认为她只是想要更多的东西，或者除了普通的生活之外。如果她没有明白，也许她错了。

‘After producing a brood of wrong children,’ said Gerald gloomily.
“生了一群错误的孩子之后，”杰拉德阴郁地说。

‘No more wrong than any of the rest of us,’ Birkin replied. ‘The most normal people have the worst subterranean selves, take them one by one.’
“并不比我们其他人更错，”伯金回答道。 “最正常的人，也有最糟糕的内心，一一列举。”

‘Sometimes I think it is a curse to be alive,’ said Gerald with sudden impotent anger.
“有时我觉得活着就是一种诅咒，”杰拉德突然愤怒地说。

‘Well,’ said Birkin, ‘why not! Let it be a curse sometimes to be alive—at other times it is anything but a curse. You’ve got plenty of zest in it really.’
“好吧，”伯金说，“为什么不呢！有时活着是一种诅咒，但有时它却不是一种诅咒。你真的很有热情。

‘Less than you’d think,’ said Gerald, revealing a strange poverty in his look at the other man.
“比你想象的要少。”杰拉尔德说道，看着对方的眼神中流露出一种奇怪的贫穷。

There was silence, each thinking his own thoughts.
一片寂静，每个人都在思考着自己的想法。

‘I don’t see what she has to distinguish between teaching at the Grammar School, and coming to teach Win,’ said Gerald.
“我不明白她对在文法学校教书和来教温有什么区别，”杰拉德说。

‘The difference between a public servant and a private one. The only nobleman today, king and only aristocrat, is the public, the public. You are quite willing to serve the public—but to be a private tutor—‘
“公务员和私人公务员的区别。今天唯一的贵族，国王和唯一的贵族，就是公众，公众。你很愿意为公众服务——但是做一名私人教师——”

‘I don’t want to serve either—‘
“我也不想服役——”

‘No! And Gudrun will probably feel the same.’
'不！古德伦可能也会有同样的感觉。

Gerald thought for a few minutes. Then he said:
杰拉尔德想了几分钟。然后他说：

‘At all events, father won’t make her feel like a private servant. He will be fussy and greatful enough.’
“无论如何，父亲不会让她觉得自己像个私人仆人。他会很挑剔，也很感激。

‘So he ought. And so ought all of you. Do you think you can hire a woman like Gudrun Brangwen with money? She is your equal like anything—probably your superior.’
‘所以他应该这么做。你们所有人都应该这样做。你认为有钱就能雇佣像古德伦·布兰文这样的女人吗？她和你一样平等——可能是你的上级。

‘Is she?’ said Gerald.
“是吗？”杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes, and if you haven’t the guts to know it, I hope she’ll leave you to your own devices.’
“是的，如果你没有勇气知道这一点，我希望她会让你自行其是。”

‘Nevertheless,’ said Gerald, ‘if she is my equal, I wish she weren’t a teacher, because I don’t think teachers as a rule are my equal.’
“尽管如此，”杰拉尔德说，“如果她与我平等，我希望她不是一名老师，因为我认为老师通常与我不同。”

‘Nor do I, damn them. But am I a teacher because I teach, or a parson because I preach?’
“我也不，该死的他们。但我是因为教书而成为老师，还是因为传教而成为牧师？

Gerald laughed. He was always uneasy on this score. He did not WANT to claim social superiority, yet he WOULD not claim intrinsic personal superiority, because he would never base his standard of values on pure being. So he wobbled upon a tacit assumption of social standing. No, Birkin wanted him to accept the fact of intrinsic difference between human beings, which he did not intend to accept. It was against his social honour, his principle. He rose to go.
杰拉尔德笑了。在这一点上他总是感到不安。他不想要求社会优越性，但他也不会要求内在的个人优越性，因为他永远不会将自己的价值观标准建立在纯粹的存在之上。因此，他对社会地位的默认假设犹豫不决。不，伯金想让他接受人类之间存在本质差异的事实，但他并不打算接受。这违背了他的社会荣誉，违背了他的原则。他起身要走。

‘I’ve been neglecting my business all this while,’ he said smiling.
“我一直都忽略了我的事情，”他微笑着说道。

‘I ought to have reminded you before,’ Birkin replied, laughing and mocking.
“我早该提醒你的，”伯金笑着嘲笑道。

‘I knew you’d say something like that,’ laughed Gerald, rather uneasily.
“我就知道你会说这样的话，”杰拉尔德有些不安地笑道。

‘Did you?’
'你是否？'

‘Yes, Rupert. It wouldn’t do for us all to be like you are—we should soon be in the cart. When I am above the world, I shall ignore all businesses.’
“是的，鲁珀特。如果我们都像你一样，那是不行的——我们应该很快就加入购物车了。当我凌驾于世界之上时，我将忽略一切事务。

‘Of course, we’re not in the cart now,’ said Birkin, satirically.
“当然，我们现在不在购物车里了，”伯金讽刺地说。

‘Not as much as you make out. At any rate, we have enough to eat and drink—‘
‘没你想象的那么多。无论如何，我们吃饱喝足——”

‘And be satisfied,’ added Birkin.
“并感到满意，”伯金补充道。

Gerald came near the bed and stood looking down at Birkin whose throat was exposed, whose tossed hair fell attractively on the warm brow, above the eyes that were so unchallenged and still in the satirical face. Gerald, full-limbed and turgid with energy, stood unwilling to go, he was held by the presence of the other man. He had not the power to go away.
杰拉尔德走到床边，低头看着柏金，柏金的喉咙裸露在外，蓬乱的头发迷人地垂在温暖的额头上，上方是那双毫无疑问、依然在讽刺的脸上的眼睛。杰拉德四肢发达，精力充沛，站在那里不愿走，因为另一个人的存在让他无法动弹。他没有能力离开。

‘So,’ said Birkin. ‘Good-bye.’ And he reached out his hand from under the bed-clothes, smiling with a glimmering look.
“所以，”伯金说。 “再见。”他从被子里伸出手，笑容灿烂。

‘Good-bye,’ said Gerald, taking the warm hand of his friend in a firm grasp. ‘I shall come again. I miss you down at the mill.’
“再见，”杰拉德说，紧紧握住朋友温暖的手。 ‘我还会再来的。我在磨坊想念你。”

‘I’ll be there in a few days,’ said Birkin.
“我几天后就会到那里，”伯金说。

The eyes of the two men met again. Gerald’s, that were keen as a hawk’s, were suffused now with warm light and with unadmitted love, Birkin looked back as out of a darkness, unsounded and unknown, yet with a kind of warmth, that seemed to flow over Gerald’s brain like a fertile sleep.
两个人的目光再次相遇。杰拉德原本像鹰一样敏锐，现在却充满了温暖的光芒和不承认的爱，伯金回头望去，就像从黑暗中走出来一样，无声无息，无人知晓，却带着一种温暖，似乎像肥沃的水流过杰拉德的大脑。睡觉。

‘Good-bye then. There’s nothing I can do for you?’
‘那就再见了。我能为你做什么吗？

‘Nothing, thanks.’
“没什么，谢谢。”

Birkin watched the black-clothed form of the other man move out of the door, the bright head was gone, he turned over to sleep.
伯金看着对方黑衣人影走出门外，明亮的脑袋消失了，他翻身睡去。

CHAPTER XVII
第十七章

THE INDUSTRIAL MAGNATE
工业巨头

In Beldover, there was both for Ursula and for Gudrun an interval. It seemed to Ursula as if Birkin had gone out of her for the time, he had lost his significance, he scarcely mattered in her world. She had her own friends, her own activities, her own life. She turned back to the old ways with zest, away from him.
在贝尔多弗，乌苏拉和古德伦都有一段休息时间。在乌苏拉看来，伯金似乎暂时离开了她，他失去了意义，他在她的世界里几乎不重要。她有自己的朋友，自己的活动，自己的生活。她满怀热情地回到了老路，远离了他。

And Gudrun, after feeling every moment in all her veins conscious of Gerald Crich, connected even physically with him, was now almost indifferent to the thought of him. She was nursing new schemes for going away and trying a new form of life. All the time, there was something in her urging her to avoid the final establishing of a relationship with Gerald. She felt it would be wiser and better to have no more than a casual acquaintance with him.
古德伦每时每刻都在意识到杰拉尔德·克里奇，甚至在身体上与他联系在一起，现在对他的想法几乎漠不关心。她正在酝酿新的离开计划并尝试新的生活方式。一直以来，她内心都有某种东西在催促她避免与杰拉德最终建立关系。她觉得与他只是简单的认识会更明智、更好。

She had a scheme for going to St Petersburg, where she had a friend who was a sculptor like herself, and who lived with a wealthy Russian whose hobby was jewel-making. The emotional, rather rootless life of the Russians appealed to her. She did not want to go to Paris. Paris was dry, and essentially boring. She would like to go to Rome, Munich, Vienna, or to St Petersburg or Moscow. She had a friend in St Petersburg and a friend in Munich. To each of these she wrote, asking about rooms.
她计划去圣彼得堡，在那里她有一个像她一样的雕塑家朋友，并且与一位爱好珠宝制作的富有的俄罗斯人住在一起。俄罗斯人的情感丰富、毫无根基的生活吸引了她。她不想去巴黎。巴黎很干燥，而且基本上很无聊。她想去罗马、慕尼黑、维也纳、圣彼得堡或莫斯科。她在圣彼得堡有一个朋友，在慕尼黑也有一个朋友。她给每一个人都写了信，询问房间的情况。

She had a certain amount of money. She had come home partly to save, and now she had sold several pieces of work, she had been praised in various shows. She knew she could become quite the ‘go’ if she went to London. But she knew London, she wanted something else. She had seventy pounds, of which nobody knew anything. She would move soon, as soon as she heard from her friends. Her nature, in spite of her apparent placidity and calm, was profoundly restless.
她有一定的钱。她回家一部分是为了存钱，现在她已经卖掉了几件作品，在各种演出中都受到了赞扬。她知道，如果她去伦敦，她就能成为一名“佼佼者”。但她了解伦敦，她想要别的东西。她有七十磅，但没人知道。一旦听到朋友的消息，她就会尽快搬家。尽管她表面上平静而平静，但她的性格却非常焦躁不安。

The sisters happened to call in a cottage in Willey Green to buy honey. Mrs Kirk, a stout, pale, sharp-nosed woman, sly, honied, with something shrewish and cat-like beneath, asked the girls into her toocosy, too tidy kitchen. There was a cat-like comfort and cleanliness everywhere.
姐妹俩碰巧来到威利格林的一间小屋去买蜂蜜。柯克太太是一位身材矮胖、脸色苍白、鼻子尖尖的女人，狡猾、狡猾，内心却像猫一样泼辣，她邀请女孩们进入她过于舒适、过于整洁的厨房。到处都是猫般的舒适和干净。

‘Yes, Miss Brangwen,’ she said, in her slightly whining, insinuating voice, ‘and how do you like being back in the old place, then?’
“是的，布兰文小姐，”她用略带哀怨、含沙射影的声音说道，“那你觉得回到老地方怎么样？”

Gudrun, whom she addressed, hated her at once.
她所称呼的古德伦立刻就讨厌她了。

‘I don’t care for it,’ she replied abruptly.
“我不在乎，”她突然回答道。

‘You don’t? Ay, well, I suppose you found a difference from London. You like life, and big, grand places. Some of us has to be content with Willey Green and Beldover. And what do you think of our Grammar School, as there’s so much talk about?’
‘你不这么认为吗？嗯，我想你发现了与伦敦的不同之处。你喜欢生活，喜欢大而宏伟的地方。我们中的一些人必须对威利·格林和贝尔多弗感到满意。既然有这么多谈论，你对我们的文法学校有什么看法？

‘What do I think of it?’ Gudrun looked round at her slowly. ‘Do you mean, do I think it’s a good school?’
“我觉得怎么样？”古珍慢慢地转头看着她。 “你的意思是，我认为这是一所好学校吗？”

‘Yes. What is your opinion of it?’
'是的。你对此有何看法？

‘I DO think it’s a good school.’
“我确实认为这是一所好学校。”

Gudrun was very cold and repelling. She knew the common people hated the school.
古德伦非常冷酷、令人厌恶。她知道普通人讨厌这所学校。

‘Ay, you do, then! I’ve heard so much, one way and the other. It’s nice to know what those that’s in it feel. But opinions vary, don’t they? Mr Crich up at Highclose is all for it. Ay, poor man, I’m afraid he’s not long for this world. He’s very poorly.’
‘哎呀，那么你就知道了！我听过很多，一种方式，另一种方式。很高兴知道其中的感受。但意见不同，不是吗？ Highclose 的 Crich 先生对此表示支持。唉，可怜的人，恐怕他已经活不多久了。他的情况非常糟糕。

‘Is he worse?’ asked Ursula.
“他的情况更糟吗？”乌苏拉问道。

‘Eh, yes—since they lost Miss Diana. He’s gone off to a shadow. Poor man, he’s had a world of trouble.’
“呃，是的——自从他们失去了戴安娜小姐之后。他已经消失得无影无踪了。可怜的人，他的世界充满了麻烦。

‘Has he?’ asked Gudrun, faintly ironic.
“是吗？”古德伦问道，语气中带着一丝讽刺。

‘He has, a world of trouble. And as nice and kind a gentleman as ever you could wish to meet. His children don’t take after him.’
‘他的世界充满了麻烦。他是一位您所希望见到的和蔼可亲的绅士。他的孩子们不像他。

‘I suppose they take after their mother?’ said Ursula.
“我猜他们很像他们的母亲？”乌苏拉说。

‘In many ways.’ Mrs Krik lowered her voice a little. ‘She was a proud haughty lady when she came into these parts—my word, she was that! She mustn’t be looked at, and it was worth your life to speak to her.’ The woman made a dry, sly face.
“在很多方面。”克里克夫人压低了声音。 “当她来到这些地方时，她是一位骄傲傲慢的女士——我保证，她就是那样！不能让别人看她，和她说话值得你付出生命。”女人做了一张干巴巴、狡猾的脸。

‘Did you know her when she was first married?’
“你在她刚结婚的时候认识她吗？”

‘Yes, I knew her. I nursed three of her children. And proper little terrors they were, little fiends—that Gerald was a demon if ever there was one, a proper demon, ay, at six months old.’ A curious malicious, sly tone came into the woman’s voice.
‘是的，我认识她。我照顾了她的三个孩子。他们是真正的小恐怖，小恶魔——杰拉尔德是一个恶魔，如果有的话，一个真正的恶魔，是的，只有六个月大。”女人的声音里带着一种奇怪的、恶意的、狡猾的语气。

‘Really,’ said Gudrun.
“真的，”古德伦说。

‘That wilful, masterful—he’d mastered one nurse at six months. Kick, and scream, and struggle like a demon. Many’s the time I’ve pinched his little bottom for him, when he was a child in arms. Ay, and he’d have been better if he’d had it pinched oftener. But she wouldn’t have them corrected—no-o, wouldn’t hear of it. I can remember the rows she had with Mr Crich, my word. When he’d got worked up, properly worked up till he could stand no more, he’d lock the study door and whip them. But she paced up and down all the while like a tiger outside, like a tiger, with very murder in her face. She had a face that could LOOK death. And when the door was opened, she’d go in with her hands lifted—‘What have you been doing to MY children, you coward.’ She was like one out of her mind. I believe he was frightened of her; he had to be driven mad before he’d lift a finger. Didn’t the servants have a life of it! And didn’t we used to be thankful when one of them caught it. They were the torment of your life.’
“那个任性、专横的人——他在六个月的时候就征服了一名护士。像恶魔一样踢腿、尖叫、挣扎。当他还是个孩子的时候，我曾多次为他捏捏他的小屁股。是的，如果他能更频繁地捏它，他会更好。但她不会让他们纠正——不，不会听到。我记得她和克里奇先生的争吵，我保证。当他兴奋起来，完全兴奋到他再也站不住的时候，他就会锁上书房的门，鞭打他们。但她却一直在外面踱来踱去，如猛虎一般，脸上带着杀气。她有一张看起来像是死亡的脸。当门打开时，她会举起双手走进去——“你对我的孩子们做了什么，你这个胆小鬼。”她就像一个疯子一样。我相信他害怕她；他必须被逼疯才能动一根手指头。仆人们不也有这样的生活吗！当他们中的一个抓住它时，我们不是很感激吗？它们是你一生的折磨。

‘Really!’ said Gudrun.
“真的！”古德伦说。

‘In every possible way. If you wouldn’t let them smash their pots on the table, if you wouldn’t let them drag the kitten about with a string round its neck, if you wouldn’t give them whatever they asked for, every mortal thing—then there was a shine on, and their mother coming in asking—‘What’s the matter with him? What have you done to him? What is it, Darling?’ And then she’d turn on you as if she’d trample you under her feet. But she didn’t trample on me. I was the only one that could do anything with her demons—for she wasn’t going to be bothered with them herself. No, SHE took no trouble for them. But they must just have their way, they mustn’t be spoken to. And Master Gerald was the beauty. I left when he was a year and a half, I could stand no more. But I pinched his little bottom for him when he was in arms, I did, when there was no holding him, and I’m not sorry I did—‘
'百般。如果你不让他们把罐子砸在桌子上，如果你不让他们用绳子把小猫拖来拖去，如果你不给他们他们想要的一切，一切凡人的东西——那么就有了他们的母亲进来问道：“他怎么了？”你对他做了什么？这是怎么回事，亲爱的？’然后她就会向你发起攻击，就好像她会把你踩在脚下一样。但她并没有践踏我。我是唯一一个可以对她的恶魔做任何事情的人——因为她自己不会为它们烦恼。不，她没有为他们找麻烦。但他们必须随心所欲，不能与他们说话。杰拉德大师是个美人。我在他一岁半的时候就离开了，我再也忍受不了了。但当他被抱在怀里时，我为他捏了捏他的小屁股，我做到了，当没有人抱住他时，我并不后悔我这么做了——”

Gudrun went away in fury and loathing. The phrase, ‘I pinched his little bottom for him,’ sent her into a white, stony fury. She could not bear it, she wanted to have the woman taken out at once and strangled. And yet there the phrase was lodged in her mind for ever, beyond escape. She felt, one day, she would HAVE to tell him, to see how he took it. And she loathed herself for the thought.
古德伦带着愤怒和厌恶离开了。 “我为他捏了他的小屁股”这句话，让她勃然大怒。她实在忍无可忍，恨不得立刻把这个女人拎出来掐死。然而这句话却永远地印在了她的脑海里，无法逃脱。她觉得，有一天，她必须告诉他，看看他如何接受。她因为这个想法而厌恶自己。

But at Shortlands the life-long struggle was coming to a close. The father was ill and was going to die. He had bad internal pains, which took away all his attentive life, and left him with only a vestige of his consciousness. More and more a silence came over him, he was less and less acutely aware of his surroundings. The pain seemed to absorb his activity. He knew it was there, he knew it would come again. It was like something lurking in the darkness within him. And he had not the power, or the will, to seek it out and to know it. There it remained in the darkness, the great pain, tearing him at times, and then being silent. And when it tore him he crouched in silent subjection under it, and when it left him alone again, he refused to know of it. It was within the darkness, let it remain unknown. So he never admitted it, except in a secret corner of himself, where all his never-revealed fears and secrets were accumulated. For the rest, he had a pain, it went away, it made no difference. It even stimulated him, excited him.
但在肖特兰兹，终生的斗争即将结束。父亲病了，快要死了。他内心剧烈的疼痛，夺走了他所有的注意力，只剩下一点意识。他越来越沉默，他对周围环境的感知也越来越不敏锐。疼痛似乎吸收了他的活动。他知道它就在那里，他知道它还会再来。就像有什么东西潜伏在他内心的黑暗之中。他没有能力、也没有意愿去寻找并了解它。那股巨大的痛苦留在了黑暗中，时不时地撕扯着他，然后就沉默了。当它撕裂他时，他默默地蹲在它下面，当它再次让他独自一人时，他拒绝知道这一点。它在黑暗之中，让它保持未知。所以他从来不承认这一点，除了在自己的一个秘密角落里，那里积累着他所有从未透露过的恐惧和秘密。其余的，他感到疼痛，疼痛消失了，没有什么区别。甚至刺激了他，让他兴奋。

But it gradually absorbed his life. Gradually it drew away all his potentiality, it bled him into the dark, it weaned him of life and drew him away into the darkness. And in this twilight of his life little remained visible to him. The business, his work, that was gone entirely. His public interests had disappeared as if they had never been. Even his family had become extraneous to him, he could only remember, in some slight non-essential part of himself, that such and such were his children. But it was historical fact, not vital to him. He had to make an effort to know their relation to him. Even his wife barely existed. She indeed was like the darkness, like the pain within him. By some strange association, the darkness that contained the pain and the darkness that contained his wife were identical. All his thoughts and understandings became blurred and fused, and now his wife and the consuming pain were the same dark secret power against him, that he never faced. He never drove the dread out of its lair within him. He only knew that there was a dark place, and something inhabiting this darkness which issued from time to time and rent him. But he dared not penetrate and drive the beast into the open. He had rather ignore its existence. Only, in his vague way, the dread was his wife, the destroyer, and it was the pain, the destruction, a darkness which was one and both.
但它却逐渐吞噬了他的生命。渐渐地，它剥夺了他所有的潜力，让他陷入黑暗，让他断奶，让他陷入黑暗。在他生命的暮年，他几乎看不到什么了。他的生意，他的工作，都完全消失了。他的公共利益消失得无影无踪，仿佛从来没有存在过一样。就连家人都对他来说变得无关紧要，他只能在自己的某个微不足道的地方记得，某某是他的孩子。但这是历史事实，对他来说并不重要。他必须努力了解他们与他的关系。就连他的妻子也几乎不存在。她确实就像黑暗，就像他内心的痛苦。出于某种奇怪的联想，包含着痛苦的黑暗和包含着他妻子的黑暗是一模一样的。他所有的思想和理解都变得模糊和融合，现在他的妻子和强烈的痛苦是同样黑暗的秘密力量在对抗他，他从未面对过。他从未将恐惧从他内心的巢穴中驱赶出来。他只知道，那里有一个黑暗的地方，而这黑暗之中，有某种东西时不时地发出来，撕裂他。但他不敢深入，将这头野兽驱赶到空旷的地方。他宁愿忽略它的存在。只是，以他模糊的方式，恐惧是他的妻子，毁灭者，是痛苦，是毁灭，是一种黑暗，两者兼而有之。

He very rarely saw his wife. She kept her room. Only occasionally she came forth, with her head stretched forward, and in her low, possessed voice, she asked him how he was. And he answered her, in the habit of more than thirty years: ‘Well, I don’t think I’m any the worse, dear.’ But he was frightened of her, underneath this safeguard of habit, frightened almost to the verge of death.
他很少见到他的妻子。她保留了自己的房间。只是偶尔她会探出头来，用低沉而着迷的声音问他怎么样。他按照三十多年来的习惯回答了她：“好吧，亲爱的，我不认为我有什么更糟。”但在这种习惯的保护下，他害怕她，几乎害怕到了边缘。死亡。

But all his life, he had been so constant to his lights, he had never broken down. He would die even now without breaking down, without knowing what his feelings were, towards her. All his life, he had said: ‘Poor Christiana, she has such a strong temper.’ With unbroken will, he had stood by this position with regard to her, he had substituted pity for all his hostility, pity had been his shield and his safeguard, and his infallible weapon. And still, in his consciousness, he was sorry for her, her nature was so violent and so impatient.
但他一生都对自己的光芒如此执着，从未崩溃过。即使现在他死了也不会崩溃，也不知道自己对她的感情是什么。他一生都在说：“可怜的克里斯蒂娜，她的脾气这么大。”他以不屈不挠的意志，对她坚持了这个立场，他用怜悯取代了所有的敌意，怜悯成了他的盾牌，他的保障，他万无一失的武器。但在他的意识中，他仍然为她感到难过，她的本性是如此暴力，如此不耐烦。

But now his pity, with his life, was wearing thin, and the dread almost amounting to horror, was rising into being. But before the armour of his pity really broke, he would die, as an insect when its shell is cracked. This was his final resource. Others would live on, and know the living death, the ensuing process of hopeless chaos. He would not. He denied death its victory.
但现在他的怜悯随着他的生命而逐渐消失，而几乎达到恐怖的恐惧正在升起。但在他怜悯的铠甲真正破裂之前，他就会像甲壳破裂的昆虫一样死去。这是他最后的资源了。其他人会继续活下去，并了解生死存亡，以及随之而来的绝望混乱的过程。他不会。他否认死亡是胜利。

He had been so constant to his lights, so constant to charity, and to his love for his neighbour. Perhaps he had loved his neighbour even better than himself—which is going one further than the commandment. Always, this flame had burned in his heart, sustaining him through everything, the welfare of the people. He was a large employer of labour, he was a great mine-owner. And he had never lost this from his heart, that in Christ he was one with his workmen. Nay, he had felt inferior to them, as if they through poverty and labour were nearer to God than he. He had always the unacknowledged belief, that it was his workmen, the miners, who held in their hands the means of salvation. To move nearer to God, he must move towards his miners, his life must gravitate towards theirs. They were, unconsciously, his idol, his God made manifest. In them he worshipped the highest, the great, sympathetic, mindless Godhead of humanity.
他对自己的光明、慈善事业以及对邻居的爱都是如此坚定不移。也许他爱邻居胜过爱自己——这比诫命更进一步。这股火焰一直在他心中燃烧，支撑着他度过一切，为人民谋福利。他是一个大的劳动力雇主，他是一个伟大的矿主。他心里从未忘记这一点：他在基督里与他的工人们合而为一。不仅如此，他还觉得自己不如他们，好像他们通过贫穷和劳动比他更接近上帝。他始终有一个不为人知的信念，即他的工人、矿工手中掌握着拯救的手段。为了更接近上帝，他必须走向他的矿工，他的生命必须向他们的方向靠近。他们不知不觉地成了他的偶像，他的上帝显现了。他在其中崇拜人类最高的、伟大的、富有同情心的、无思想的神性。

And all the while, his wife had opposed him like one of the great demons of hell. Strange, like a bird of prey, with the fascinating beauty and abstraction of a hawk, she had beat against the bars of his philanthropy, and like a hawk in a cage, she had sunk into silence. By force of circumstance, because all the world combined to make the cage unbreakable, he had been too strong for her, he had kept her prisoner. And because she was his prisoner, his passion for her had always remained keen as death. He had always loved her, loved her with intensity. Within the cage, she was denied nothing, she was given all licence.
而一直以来，他的妻子都像地狱的大恶魔之一一样反对他。奇怪的是，她像一只猛禽，带着鹰的迷人美丽和抽象，撞上了他慈善事业的栅栏，又像笼中的鹰一样，陷入了沉默。由于环境的影响，因为整个世界的结合使这个牢笼牢不可破，他对她来说太强大了，他把她囚禁起来。而因为她是他的阶下囚，他对她的热情始终如死一般。他一直爱着她，爱得很深。在笼子里，她没有被拒绝，所有的许可都给了她。

But she had gone almost mad. Of wild and overweening temper, she could not bear the humiliation of her husband’s soft, half-appealing kindness to everybody. He was not deceived by the poor. He knew they came and sponged on him, and whined to him, the worse sort; the majority, luckily for him, were much too proud to ask for anything, much too independent to come knocking at his door. But in Beldover, as everywhere else, there were the whining, parasitic, foul human beings who come crawling after charity, and feeding on the living body of the public like lice. A kind of fire would go over Christiana Crich’s brain, as she saw two more pale-faced, creeping women in objectionable black clothes, cringing lugubriously up the drive to the door. She wanted to set the dogs on them, ‘Hi Rip! Hi Ring! Ranger! At ‘em boys, set ‘em off.’ But Crowther, the butler, with all the rest of the servants, was Mr Crich’s man. Nevertheless, when her husband was away, she would come down like a wolf on the crawling supplicants;
但她已经快疯了。她的脾气狂野而傲慢，无法忍受丈夫对每个人都温柔、半吸引人的善意所带来的羞辱。他没有被穷人欺骗。他知道它们来了，吸食他，向他哀嚎，而且是最糟糕的那种。对他来说幸运的是，大多数人都太骄傲了，不会要求任何东西，太独立了，不会来敲他的门。但在贝尔多弗，就像其他地方一样，有一些抱怨的、寄生的、肮脏的人，他们在慈善事业中爬行而来，像虱子一样以公众的活体为食。当克里斯蒂安娜·克里奇看到另外两个面色苍白、身着令人反感的黑衣、阴森恐怖的女人沿着车道向门口走去时，她的脑子里会冒出一股火来。她想让狗咬他们，‘嗨，瑞普！嗨环！游骑兵！但是，管家克劳瑟和所有其他仆人都是克里奇先生的手下。然而，当她丈夫不在的时候，她就会像狼一样扑向那些爬行的恳求者。

‘What do you people want? There is nothing for you here. You have no business on the drive at all. Simpson, drive them away and let no more of them through the gate.’
‘你们想要什么？这里没有什么适合你的。你根本就没有开车的事。辛普森，把他们赶走，不要再让他们进门了。”

The servants had to obey her. And she would stand watching with an eye like the eagle’s, whilst the groom in clumsy confusion drove the lugubrious persons down the drive, as if they were rusty fowls, scuttling before him.
仆人们必须服从她。她会站在那儿，用鹰一样的眼睛注视着，而新郎则笨手笨脚地把这些阴郁的人驱赶到车道上，就像生锈的家禽在他面前乱窜一样。

But they learned to know, from the lodge-keeper, when Mrs Crich was away, and they timed their visits. How many times, in the first years, would Crowther knock softly at the door: ‘Person to see you, sir.’
但他们从旅馆管理员那里得知克里奇夫人什么时候不在，并安排了拜访的时间。在最初的几年里，克劳瑟会多少次轻轻地敲门：“有人要见您，先生。”

‘What name?’
'什么名字？'

‘Grocock, sir.’
“格罗科克，先生。”

‘What do they want?’ The question was half impatient, half gratified. He liked hearing appeals to his charity.
“他们想要什么？”这个问题半是不耐烦，半是满意。他喜欢听到对他的慈善事业的呼吁。

‘About a child, sir.’
“关于一个孩子，先生。”

‘Show them into the library, and tell them they shouldn’t come after eleven o’clock in the morning.’
“带他们进图书馆，并告诉他们早上十一点以后不要来。”

‘Why do you get up from dinner?—send them off,’ his wife would say abruptly.
“你吃完晚饭为什么起床？——送他们走，”他的妻子会突然说。

‘Oh, I can’t do that. It’s no trouble just to hear what they have to say.’
‘哦，我不能那样做。听听他们说的话并不麻烦。

‘How many more have been here today? Why don’t you establish open house for them? They would soon oust me and the children.’
‘今天还有多少人来过这里？你为什么不为他们设立开放日呢？他们很快就会驱逐我和孩子们。

‘You know dear, it doesn’t hurt me to hear what they have to say. And if they really are in trouble—well, it is my duty to help them out of it.’
“你知道，亲爱的，听听他们所说的话并不伤害我。如果他们真的遇到麻烦了——那么，我有责任帮助他们摆脱困境。”

‘It’s your duty to invite all the rats in the world to gnaw at your bones.’
“你有责任邀请世界上所有的老鼠来啃你的骨头。”

‘Come, Christiana, it isn’t like that. Don’t be uncharitable.’
‘得了吧，克里斯蒂安娜，事情不是那样的。不要无情。

But she suddenly swept out of the room, and out to the study. There sat the meagre charity-seekers, looking as if they were at the doctor’s.
但她却突然冲出了房间，来到了书房。那些可怜的施舍者坐在那里，看起来就像在医生那里一样。

‘Mr Crich can’t see you. He can’t see you at this hour. Do you think he is your property, that you can come whenever you like? You must go away, there is nothing for you here.’
“克里奇先生看不到你。他这个时间看不到你。你以为他是你的财产，你想什么时候来就什么时候来吗？你必须走开，这里没有什么适合你的。

The poor people rose in confusion. But Mr Crich, pale and black-bearded and deprecating, came behind her, saying:
可怜的人们困惑地站了起来。但克里奇先生脸色苍白，留着黑胡子，一脸不以为然地走到她身后，说道：

‘Yes, I don’t like you coming as late as this. I’ll hear any of you in the morning part of the day, but I can’t really do with you after. What’s amiss then, Gittens. How is your Missis?’
“是的，我不喜欢你来得这么晚。”我会在一天的早上听到你们中的任何一个人的声音，但之后我就无法再和你们在一起了。那是怎么回事，吉滕斯。你小姐怎么样？

‘Why, she’s sunk very low, Mester Crich, she’s a’most gone, she is—‘
“哎呀，她已经沉得很低了，克里奇先生，她已经‘快要死了，她——’

Sometimes, it seemed to Mrs Crich as if her husband were some subtle funeral bird, feeding on the miseries of the people. It seemed to her he was never satisfied unless there was some sordid tale being poured out to him, which he drank in with a sort of mournful, sympathetic satisfaction. He would have no RAISON D’ETRE if there were no lugubrious miseries in the world, as an undertaker would have no meaning if there were no funerals.
有时，克里奇夫人觉得她的丈夫就像一只狡猾的丧鸟，以人民的苦难为食。在她看来，除非有人向他倾诉一些肮脏的故事，否则他永远不会感到满足，而他带着一种悲伤而同情的满足感喝着这些故事。如果世界上没有悲惨的苦难，他就没有存在的理由，就像如果没有葬礼，殡仪馆的承办人就没有意义一样。

Mrs Crich recoiled back upon herself, she recoiled away from this world of creeping democracy. A band of tight, baleful exclusion fastened round her heart, her isolation was fierce and hard, her antagonism was passive but terribly pure, like that of a hawk in a cage. As the years went on, she lost more and more count of the world, she seemed rapt in some glittering abstraction, almost purely unconscious. She would wander about the house and about the surrounding country, staring keenly and seeing nothing. She rarely spoke, she had no connection with the world. And she did not even think. She was consumed in a fierce tension of opposition, like the negative pole of a magnet.
克里奇夫人退缩了，她退缩了，远离了这个悄然蔓延的民主世界。一股严酷、恶毒的排斥感紧紧地缠绕在她的心上，她的孤立感是强烈而坚硬的，她的对抗是被动的，但又非常纯粹，就像笼中的鹰一样。随着岁月的流逝，她对这个世界越来越失去了兴趣，她似乎全神贯注于某种闪闪发光的抽象事物，几乎完全无意识。她会在房子里和周围的乡村里闲逛，目光锐利地凝视着，却什么也看不见。她很少说话，与这个世界没有任何联系。而她根本就没有想到。她被强烈的对立张力所吞噬，就像磁铁的负极一样。

And she bore many children. For, as time went on, she never opposed her husband in word or deed. She took no notice of him, externally. She submitted to him, let him take what he wanted and do as he wanted with her. She was like a hawk that sullenly submits to everything. The relation between her and her husband was wordless and unknown, but it was deep, awful, a relation of utter inter-destruction. And he, who triumphed in the world, he became more and more hollow in his vitality, the vitality was bled from within him, as by some haemorrhage. She was hulked like a hawk in a cage, but her heart was fierce and undiminished within her, though her mind was destroyed.
她生了很多孩子。因为随着时间的推移，她从未在言语或行动上反对过她的丈夫。从表面上看，她并没有注意到他。她屈服于他，让他拿走他想要的，对她为所欲为。她就像一只阴沉地屈服于一切的鹰。她和她丈夫之间的关系是无言的、不为人知的，但却是深刻的、可怕的、彻底的相互毁灭的关系。而他，在这个世界上取得了胜利，他的元气却越来越空虚，元气从他体内流失，就像出血了一样。她像笼中的鹰一样笨重，但她的内心却凶猛不减，尽管她的神智已被摧毁。

So to the last he would go to her and hold her in his arms sometimes, before his strength was all gone. The terrible white, destructive light that burned in her eyes only excited and roused him. Till he was bled to death, and then he dreaded her more than anything. But he always said to himself, how happy he had been, how he had loved her with a pure and consuming love ever since he had known her. And he thought of her as pure, chaste; the white flame which was known to him alone, the flame of her sex, was a white flower of snow to his mind. She was a wonderful white snow-flower, which he had desired infinitely. And now he was dying with all his ideas and interpretations intact. They would only collapse when the breath left his body. Till then they would be pure truths for him. Only death would show the perfect completeness of the lie. Till death, she was his white snow-flower. He had subdued her, and her subjugation was to him an infinite chastity in her, a virginity which he could never break, and which dominated him as by a spell.
所以直到最后，有时在他的力气耗尽之前，他会走到她身边，把她抱在怀里。她眼中燃烧的可怕的白色、毁灭性的光芒只会让他兴奋、惊醒。直到他失血过多而死，然后他才最害怕她。但他总是对自己说，他是多么幸福，自从认识她以来，他就用一种纯洁而强烈的爱来爱着她。他认为她纯洁、贞洁；只有他知道的白色火焰，她性的火焰，在他看来是一朵白色的雪花。她是一朵美妙的白色雪花，是他无限向往的。现在他临终时，他所有的想法和解释都完好无损。只有当呼吸离开他的身体时，他们才会崩溃。到那时，它们对他来说将是纯粹的真理。只有死亡才能证明谎言的完美。至死，她都是他的洁白雪花。他征服了她，而她的征服对他来说就是她身上无限的贞洁，一种他永远无法打破的童贞，它像咒语一样控制着他。

She had let go the outer world, but within herself she was unbroken and unimpaired. She only sat in her room like a moping, dishevelled hawk, motionless, mindless. Her children, for whom she had been so fierce in her youth, now meant scarcely anything to her. She had lost all that, she was quite by herself. Only Gerald, the gleaming, had some existence for her. But of late years, since he had become head of the business, he too was forgotten. Whereas the father, now he was dying, turned for compassion to Gerald. There had always been opposition between the two of them. Gerald had feared and despised his father, and to a great extent had avoided him all through boyhood and young manhood. And the father had felt very often a real dislike of his eldest son, which, never wanting to give way to, he had refused to acknowledge. He had ignored Gerald as much as possible, leaving him alone.
她已经放下了外在的世界，但她的内心却完好无损。她只是坐在自己的房间里，像一只闷闷不乐、头发蓬乱的老鹰，一动不动，没有头脑。她年轻时对孩子们非常严厉，现在对她来说几乎毫无意义。她已经失去了这一切，她孤身一人。只有闪闪发光的杰拉尔德对她来说还有存在感。但近年来，自从他成为该业务的负责人后，他也被遗忘了。而父亲现在已经快要死了，他向杰拉尔德表示同情。两人之间一直存在着对立。杰拉尔德一直害怕并鄙视他的父亲，并且在整个童年和青年时期都在很大程度上避开了他。父亲常常对他的大儿子感到真正的厌恶，但他从来不想承认这一点，因此拒绝承认。他尽可能地无视杰拉德，留下他独自一人。

Since, however, Gerald had come home and assumed responsibility in the firm, and had proved such a wonderful director, the father, tired and weary of all outside concerns, had put all his trust of these things in his son, implicitly, leaving everything to him, and assuming a rather touching dependence on the young enemy. This immediately roused a poignant pity and allegiance in Gerald’s heart, always shadowed by contempt and by unadmitted enmity. For Gerald was in reaction against Charity; and yet he was dominated by it, it assumed supremacy in the inner life, and he could not confute it. So he was partly subject to that which his father stood for, but he was in reaction against it. Now he could not save himself. A certain pity and grief and tenderness for his father overcame him, in spite of the deeper, more sullen hostility.
然而，自从杰拉尔德回家并承担了公司的责任，并证明了自己是一位出色的董事之后，父亲就厌倦了所有外界的关注，将所有的信任都托付给了儿子，含蓄地，把一切都留给了儿子。对他来说，并对这个年轻的敌人产生了相当感人的依赖。这立即在杰拉德心中激起了一种强烈的怜悯和忠诚，而他的心中始终笼罩着蔑视和不承认的敌意。因为杰拉德反对慈善事业；然而他却被它所支配，它在内心生活中占据了至高无上的地位，他无法反驳它。因此，他在一定程度上服从了他父亲所主张的观点，但他又对此做出了反应。现在他无法拯救自己了。尽管心中有更深沉、更阴沉的敌意，但对父亲的某种怜悯、悲伤和温柔还是征服了他。

The father won shelter from Gerald through compassion. But for love he had Winifred. She was his youngest child, she was the only one of his children whom he had ever closely loved. And her he loved with all the great, overweening, sheltering love of a dying man. He wanted to shelter her infinitely, infinitely, to wrap her in warmth and love and shelter, perfectly. If he could save her she should never know one pain, one grief, one hurt. He had been so right all his life, so constant in his kindness and his goodness. And this was his last passionate righteousness, his love for the child Winifred. Some things troubled him yet. The world had passed away from him, as his strength ebbed. There were no more poor and injured and humble to protect and succour. These were all lost to him. There were no more sons and daughters to trouble him, and to weigh on him as an unnatural responsibility. These too had faded out of reality All these things had fallen out of his hands, and left him free.
父亲通过同情心赢得了杰拉尔德的庇护。但为了爱情，他有了威妮弗雷德。她是他最小的孩子，也是他唯一最爱的孩子。他以临终之人的所有伟大、傲慢、庇护之爱来爱着她。他想无限地、无限地庇护她，将她完美地包裹在温暖、爱和庇护之中。如果他能救她，她就永远不会经历一种痛苦，一种悲伤，一种伤害。他一生都是如此正确，他的仁慈和善良始终如一。这是他最后的热血正义，他对孩子温妮弗雷德的爱。有些事情还困扰着他。随着他的力量衰退，世界已经离他而去。不再有穷人、受伤者和卑微的人需要保护和救助。这些都对他失去了。不再有儿女来打扰他，也不再有不自然的责任压在他身上。这些也都从现实中消失了。所有这些东西都脱离了他的掌控，让他自由了。

There remained the covert fear and horror of his wife, as she sat mindless and strange in her room, or as she came forth with slow, prowling step, her head bent forward. But this he put away. Even his life-long righteousness, however, would not quite deliver him from the inner horror. Still, he could keep it sufficiently at bay. It would never break forth openly. Death would come first.
当他的妻子毫无意识地、陌生地坐在自己的房间里，或者当她低着头、缓慢地、徘徊着的脚步走出来时，他的妻子仍然隐藏着恐惧和恐惧。但他把这个收了起来。然而，即使他一生的正义，也无法让他完全摆脱内心的恐惧。尽管如此，他仍然可以充分阻止它。它永远不会公开爆发。死亡将是第一位的。

Then there was Winifred! If only he could be sure about her, if only he could be sure. Since the death of Diana, and the development of his illness, his craving for surety with regard to Winifred amounted almost to obsession. It was as if, even dying, he must have some anxiety, some responsibility of love, of Charity, upon his heart.
然后是温妮弗雷德！要是他能确定她的事就好了，要是他能确定的话就好了。自从戴安娜去世以及他的病情恶化以来，他对威妮弗雷德的渴望几乎达到了痴迷。就好像，即使是临终，他的心中也必须有某种焦虑、某种爱、慈善的责任。

She was an odd, sensitive, inflammable child, having her father’s dark hair and quiet bearing, but being quite detached, momentaneous. She was like a changeling indeed, as if her feelings did not matter to her, really. She often seemed to be talking and playing like the gayest and most childish of children, she was full of the warmest, most delightful affection for a few things—for her father, and for her animals in particular. But if she heard that her beloved kitten Leo had been run over by the motor-car she put her head on one side, and replied, with a faint contraction like resentment on her face: ‘Has he?’ Then she took no more notice. She only disliked the servant who would force bad news on her, and wanted her to be sorry. She wished not to know, and that seemed her chief motive. She avoided her mother, and most of the members of her family. She LOVED her Daddy, because he wanted her always to be happy, and because he seemed to become young again, and irresponsible in her presence. She liked Gerald, because he was so self-contained. She loved people who would make life a game for her. She had an amazing instinctive critical faculty, and was a pure anarchist, a pure aristocrat at once. For she accepted her equals wherever she found them, and she ignored with blithe indifference her inferiors, whether they were her brothers and sisters, or whether they were wealthy guests of the house, or whether they were the common people or the servants. She was quite single and by herself, deriving from nobody. It was as if she were cut off from all purpose or continuity, and existed simply moment by moment.
她是一个奇怪、敏感、易怒的孩子，继承了她父亲的黑发和安静的举止，但又相当超然、易怒。她确实就像一个换生灵，好像她的感受对她来说并不重要，真的。她常常看起来像最快乐、最孩子气的孩子一样说话和玩耍，她对一些事情充满了最温暖、最令人愉快的感情——对她的父亲，特别是对她的动物。但如果她听说她心爱的小猫利奥被汽车碾过，她就会把头偏向一侧，脸上带着怨恨般的微弱收缩，回答道：“是吗？”然后她就不再理睬了。 。她只是不喜欢仆人把坏消息强加给她，想让她道歉。她不想知道，而这似乎是她的主要动机。她避开了她的母亲和她的大多数家庭成员。她爱她的爸爸，因为他希望她永远快乐，因为他似乎又变得年轻了，在她面前不负责任。她喜欢杰拉德，因为他非常自持。她爱那些愿意把生活变成她的游戏的人。她具有惊人的本能批判能力，是一个纯粹的无政府主义者，同时也是一个纯粹的贵族。因为无论她在哪里找到平等的人，她都会接受，而她会以一种愉快而冷漠的态度忽视她的地位低下的人，无论他们是她的兄弟姐妹，还是家里的富有的客人，或者他们是平民还是仆人。她非常单身，独自一人，不属于任何人。就好像她脱离了所有的目的或连续性，只是时时刻刻地存在着。

The father, as by some strange final illusion, felt as if all his fate depended on his ensuring to Winifred her happiness. She who could never suffer, because she never formed vital connections, she who could lose the dearest things of her life and be just the same the next day, the whole memory dropped out, as if deliberately, she whose will was so strangely and easily free, anarchistic, almost nihilistic, who like a soulless bird flits on its own will, without attachment or responsibility beyond the moment, who in her every motion snapped the threads of serious relationship with blithe, free hands, really nihilistic, because never troubled, she must be the object of her father’s final passionate solicitude.
父亲仿佛出于某种奇怪的最终幻觉，觉得自己的全部命运似乎都取决于他能否确保温妮弗雷德的幸福。她永远不会受苦，因为她从未形成重要的联系，她可能会失去生命中最珍贵的东西，第二天就和以前一样，整个记忆都消失了，仿佛是故意的，她的意志是如此奇怪而容易自由，无政府主义，近乎虚无主义，她就像一只没有灵魂的鸟儿，凭自己的意志飞翔，没有任何依恋或超越当下的责任，她的每一个动作都用快乐、自由的双手切断了严肃关系的线索，真正的虚无主义，因为从不烦恼，她一定是她父亲最后热情关怀的对象。

When Mr Crich heard that Gudrun Brangwen might come to help Winifred with her drawing and modelling he saw a road to salvation for his child. He believed that Winifred had talent, he had seen Gudrun, he knew that she was an exceptional person. He could give Winifred into her hands as into the hands of a right being. Here was a direction and a positive force to be lent to his child, he need not leave her directionless and defenceless. If he could but graft the girl on to some tree of utterance before he died, he would have fulfilled his responsibility. And here it could be done. He did not hesitate to appeal to Gudrun.
当克里奇先生听说古德伦·布兰文可能会来帮助威妮弗雷德绘画和建模时，他看到了一条拯救他孩子的道路。他相信温妮弗雷德有天赋，他见过戈珍，知道她是一个非凡的人。他可以把威妮弗雷德交给她，就像交给一个正确的人一样。这是一个可以借给他的孩子的方向和积极的力量，他不必让她失去方向和毫无防备。如果他能在临终前把这个女孩嫁接在话语之树上，他就已经完成了自己的责任。在这里可以做到。他毫不犹豫地向古德伦求助。

Meanwhile, as the father drifted more and more out of life, Gerald experienced more and more a sense of exposure. His father after all had stood for the living world to him. Whilst his father lived Gerald was not responsible for the world. But now his father was passing away, Gerald found himself left exposed and unready before the storm of living, like the mutinous first mate of a ship that has lost his captain, and who sees only a terrible chaos in front of him. He did not inherit an established order and a living idea. The whole unifying idea of mankind seemed to be dying with his father, the centralising force that had held the whole together seemed to collapse with his father, the parts were ready to go asunder in terrible disintegration. Gerald was as if left on board of a ship that was going asunder beneath his feet, he was in charge of a vessel whose timbers were all coming apart.
与此同时，随着父亲越来越远离生活，杰拉德感受到越来越多的暴露感。毕竟，他的父亲对他来说代表着生机勃勃的世界。当他父亲活着的时候，杰拉尔德并不对世界负责。但现在他的父亲即将去世，杰拉尔德发现自己暴露在生活的风暴面前，毫无准备，就像一艘失去船长的船上的叛变大副，他只看到面前是一片可怕的混乱。他没有继承既定的秩序和鲜活的思想。人类的整个统一观念似乎正在随着他的父亲而消亡，将整体凝聚在一起的集中力量似乎也随着他的父亲而瓦解，各个部分即将在可怕的瓦解中四分五裂。杰拉尔德仿佛被留在了一艘在他脚下即将解体的船上，他负责管理着一艘木材全部散架的船。

He knew that all his life he had been wrenching at the frame of life to break it apart. And now, with something of the terror of a destructive child, he saw himself on the point of inheriting his own destruction. And during the last months, under the influence of death, and of Birkin’s talk, and of Gudrun’s penetrating being, he had lost entirely that mechanical certainty that had been his triumph. Sometimes spasms of hatred came over him, against Birkin and Gudrun and that whole set. He wanted to go back to the dullest conservatism, to the most stupid of conventional people. He wanted to revert to the strictest Toryism. But the desire did not last long enough to carry him into action.
他知道他一生都在扭动生命的框架，将其拆散。而现在，带着对一个具有破坏性的孩子的恐惧，他看到自己即将继承自己的毁灭。在过去的几个月里，在死亡、伯金的谈话和古德伦的洞察力的影响下，他完全失去了他的胜利的机械确定性。有时，他会感到一阵阵的仇恨，针对伯金、古德伦以及整群人。他想回到最迟钝的保守主义，回到最愚蠢的传统人那里。他想恢复最严格的保守党主义。但这种愿望并没有持续太久，不足以让他付诸行动。

During his childhood and his boyhood he had wanted a sort of savagedom. The days of Homer were his ideal, when a man was chief of an army of heroes, or spent his years in wonderful Odyssey. He hated remorselessly the circumstances of his own life, so much that he never really saw Beldover and the colliery valley. He turned his face entirely away from the blackened mining region that stretched away on the right hand of Shortlands, he turned entirely to the country and the woods beyond Willey Water. It was true that the panting and rattling of the coal mines could always be heard at Shortlands. But from his earliest childhood, Gerald had paid no heed to this. He had ignored the whole of the industrial sea which surged in coal-blackened tides against the grounds of the house. The world was really a wilderness where one hunted and swam and rode. He rebelled against all authority. Life was a condition of savage freedom.
在他的童年和少年时期，他一直想要一种野蛮的生活。荷马时代是他的理想，那时一个人是英雄军队的首领，或者在美妙的奥德赛中度过了岁月。他无情地憎恨自己的生活环境，以至于他从未真正见过贝尔多弗和煤矿山谷。他完全把脸转向肖特兰右手边那片漆黑的矿区，完全转向威利沃特那边的乡村和树林。确实，在肖特兰兹，煤矿的喘息声和嘎嘎声总能听到。但从童年起，杰拉尔德就没有注意到这一点。他忽略了整个工业海洋，它在房子的地面上以煤黑的潮水汹涌澎湃。世界实际上是一片荒野，人们可以在那里打猎、游泳和骑马。他反抗一切权威。生活是野蛮自由的一个条件。

Then he had been sent away to school, which was so much death to him. He refused to go to Oxford, choosing a German university. He had spent a certain time at Bonn, at Berlin, and at Frankfurt. There, a curiosity had been aroused in his mind. He wanted to see and to know, in a curious objective fashion, as if it were an amusement to him. Then he must try war. Then he must travel into the savage regions that had so attracted him.
然后他被送去上学，这对他来说简直就是死亡。他拒绝去牛津大学，选择了一所德国大学。他曾在波恩、柏林和法兰克福待过一段时间。说到这里，他的心中顿时升起一丝好奇。他想以一种好奇客观的方式去观察和了解，就好像这对他来说是一种乐趣。那么他必须尝试战争。然后他必须前往那些如此吸引他的野蛮地区。

The result was, he found humanity very much alike everywhere, and to a mind like his, curious and cold, the savage was duller, less exciting than the European. So he took hold of all kinds of sociological ideas, and ideas of reform. But they never went more than skin-deep, they were never more than a mental amusement. Their interest lay chiefly in the reaction against the positive order, the destructive reaction.
结果是，他发现世界各地的人性都非常相似，对于像他这样好奇而冷酷的人来说，野蛮人比欧洲人更迟钝​​、更不令人兴奋。所以他掌握了各种社会学思想和改革思想。但它们从来都只是肤浅的，它们只不过是一种精神上的娱乐。他们的兴趣主要在于对积极秩序的反应，即破坏性的反应。

He discovered at last a real adventure in the coal-mines. His father asked him to help in the firm. Gerald had been educated in the science of mining, and it had never interested him. Now, suddenly, with a sort of exultation, he laid hold of the world.
他终于在煤矿里发现了一次真正的冒险。他的父亲请他到公司帮忙。杰拉尔德接受过采矿科学方面的教育，但他对此从来不感兴趣。现在，突然间，带着某种狂喜，他掌控了整个世界。

There was impressed photographically on his consciousness the great industry. Suddenly, it was real, he was part of it. Down the valley ran the colliery railway, linking mine with mine. Down the railway ran the trains, short trains of heavily laden trucks, long trains of empty wagons, each one bearing in big white letters the initials:
伟大的工业给他留下了深刻的印象。突然间，一切都变得真实了，他成为了其中的一部分。煤矿铁路沿着山谷而下，将我的矿与我的矿连接起来。火车沿着铁路行驶，短的火车上载着满载的卡车，长的火车上载着空货车，每列火车上都写着大写的白色字母：

‘C.B.&Co.’
“C.B.&Co.”

These white letters on all the wagons he had seen since his first childhood, and it was as if he had never seen them, they were so familiar, and so ignored. Now at last he saw his own name written on the wall. Now he had a vision of power.
这些白色的字母，他从小就见过的所有马车上的白色字母，就像从来没有见过一样，它们是那么熟悉，又那么被忽视。现在他终于看到了自己的名字写在墙上。现在他有了权力的愿景。

So many wagons, bearing his initial, running all over the country. He saw them as he entered London in the train, he saw them at Dover. So far his power ramified. He looked at Beldover, at Selby, at Whatmore, at Lethley Bank, the great colliery villages which depended entirely on his mines. They were hideous and sordid, during his childhood they had been sores in his consciousness. And now he saw them with pride. Four raw new towns, and many ugly industrial hamlets were crowded under his dependence. He saw the stream of miners flowing along the causeways from the mines at the end of the afternoon, thousands of blackened, slightly distorted human beings with red mouths, all moving subjugate to his will. He pushed slowly in his motor-car through the little market-top on Friday nights in Beldover, through a solid mass of human beings that were making their purchases and doing their weekly spending. They were all subordinate to him. They were ugly and uncouth, but they were his instruments. He was the God of the machine. They made way for his motor-car automatically, slowly.
那么多载着他姓名首字母的马车，行驶在全国各地。当他乘火车进入伦敦时，他看到了他们，他在多佛也看到了他们。到目前为止，他的权力已经产生了影响。他考察了贝尔多弗、塞尔比、瓦特莫尔、莱斯利班克这些完全依赖他的矿场的煤矿村庄。它们是丑陋的、肮脏的，在他的童年时期，它们曾是他意识中的疮疤。现在他自豪地看到他们。四个原始的新城镇和许多丑陋的工业村落都挤在他的依赖之下。下午快结束的时候，他看到矿工们沿着堤道从矿井里涌出来，成千上万个皮肤黝黑、身体有些扭曲、嘴巴通红的人类，全都屈服于他的意志。周五晚上，他开着汽车缓慢地穿过贝尔多弗的小市场顶，穿过一大群正在购物和每周消费的人群。他们都是他的下属。它们丑陋又粗俗，但它们是他的工具。他是机器之神。他们自动地、缓慢地为他的汽车让路。

He did not care whether they made way with alacrity, or grudgingly. He did not care what they thought of him. His vision had suddenly crystallised. Suddenly he had conceived the pure instrumentality of mankind. There had been so much humanitarianism, so much talk of sufferings and feelings. It was ridiculous. The sufferings and feelings of individuals did not matter in the least. They were mere conditions, like the weather. What mattered was the pure instrumentality of the individual. As a man as of a knife: does it cut well? Nothing else mattered.
他不在乎他们是欣然让路，还是勉强让路。他不在乎他们怎么看他。他的视野突然变得清晰起来。突然间，他想到了人类的纯粹工具性。有如此多的人道主义，有如此多的关于痛苦和感受的谈论。这太荒谬了。个人的痛苦和感受根本不重要。它们只是条件，就像天气一样。重要的是个人的纯粹工具性。人如刀：切得好吗？其他的都不重要了。

Everything in the world has its function, and is good or not good in so far as it fulfils this function more or less perfectly. Was a miner a good miner? Then he was complete. Was a manager a good manager? That was enough. Gerald himself, who was responsible for all this industry, was he a good director? If he were, he had fulfilled his life. The rest was by-play.
世界上的一切事物都有其功能，好坏取决于它或多或少完美地履行了这一功能。矿工是好矿工吗？然后他就完整了。经理是一个好经理吗？这就足够了。负责整个行业的杰拉德本人是一个好导演吗？如果是的话，他的人生就圆满了。其余的都是旁观。

The mines were there, they were old. They were giving out, it did not pay to work the seams. There was talk of closing down two of them. It was at this point that Gerald arrived on the scene.
地雷就在那里，而且很旧。他们已经放弃了，缝缝补补是没有回报的。有传言称要关闭其中两家。就在这个时候，杰拉德赶到了现场。

He looked around. There lay the mines. They were old, obsolete. They were like old lions, no more good. He looked again. Pah! the mines were nothing but the clumsy efforts of impure minds. There they lay, abortions of a half-trained mind. Let the idea of them be swept away. He cleared his brain of them, and thought only of the coal in the under earth. How much was there?
他看了看周围。那里埋有地雷。它们很旧、过时了。他们就像老狮子一样，不再善良了。他又看了一眼。呸！这些地雷不过是思想不纯洁者的笨拙努力而已。他们躺在那里，是半受过训练的心灵的堕胎。让他们的想法一扫而光。他清除了大脑中的这些东西，只想到了地下的煤炭。有多少钱？

There was plenty of coal. The old workings could not get at it, that was all. Then break the neck of the old workings. The coal lay there in its seams, even though the seams were thin. There it lay, inert matter, as it had always lain, since the beginning of time, subject to the will of man. The will of man was the determining factor. Man was the archgod of earth. His mind was obedient to serve his will. Man’s will was the absolute, the only absolute.
那里有充足的煤炭。旧的工作方式无法做到这一点，仅此而已。然后打破旧工作的瓶颈。尽管煤层很薄，但煤就躺在煤层里。它躺在那里，是一种惰性物质，自古以来它就一直躺在那里，受制于人类的意志。人的意志是决定因素。人类是地球的大神。他的思想服从于他的意志。人的意志是绝对的，唯一的绝对。

And it was his will to subjugate Matter to his own ends. The subjugation itself was the point, the fight was the be-all, the fruits of victory were mere results. It was not for the sake of money that Gerald took over the mines. He did not care about money, fundamentally. He was neither ostentatious nor luxurious, neither did he care about social position, not finally. What he wanted was the pure fulfilment of his own will in the struggle with the natural conditions. His will was now, to take the coal out of the earth, profitably. The profit was merely the condition of victory, but the victory itself lay in the feat achieved. He vibrated with zest before the challenge. Every day he was in the mines, examining, testing, he consulted experts, he gradually gathered the whole situation into his mind, as a general grasps the plan of his campaign.
他的意志是为了自己的目的而征服物质。征服本身就是重点，战斗才是一切，胜利的果实只是结果。杰拉德接管矿山并不是为了钱。从根本上来说，他并不关心钱。他既不招摇也不奢华，也不在意社会地位，最终也没有。他想要的是在与自然条件的斗争中纯粹地实现自己的意志。他现在的愿望是从地下开采煤炭并从中获利。利润只是胜利的条件，但胜利本身就在于所取得的功绩。在挑战之前，他充满了热情。他每天都在矿井里，检查、测试，请教专家，他逐渐把整个情况记在脑子里，就像一个将军掌握他的作战计划一样。

Then there was need for a complete break. The mines were run on an old system, an obsolete idea. The initial idea had been, to obtain as much money from the earth as would make the owners comfortably rich, would allow the workmen sufficient wages and good conditions, and would increase the wealth of the country altogether. Gerald’s father, following in the second generation, having a sufficient fortune, had thought only of the men. The mines, for him, were primarily great fields to produce bread and plenty for all the hundreds of human beings gathered about them. He had lived and striven with his fellow owners to benefit the men every time. And the men had been benefited in their fashion. There were few poor, and few needy. All was plenty, because the mines were good and easy to work. And the miners, in those days, finding themselves richer than they might have expected, felt glad and triumphant. They thought themselves well-off, they congratulated themselves on their good-fortune, they remembered how their fathers had starved and suffered, and they felt that better times had come. They were grateful to those others, the pioneers, the new owners, who had opened out the pits, and let forth this stream of plenty.
然后需要彻底休息。这些矿井是在旧系统上运行的，这是一个过时的想法。最初的想法是，从土地上获取尽可能多的钱，让业主过上富裕的生活，让工人有足够的工资和良好的条件，并增加国家的财富。杰拉尔德的父亲是第二代，拥有足够的财富，只想到男人。对他来说，矿井主要是为聚集在矿井周围的数百人生产面包和充足食物的大田。他与其他业主一起生活、奋斗，每次都为人民谋福利。男人们也从他们的时尚中受益。穷人很少，有需要的人也很少。一切都足够了，因为矿井条件很好，而且开采也很容易。那些日子里，矿工们发现自己比他们想象的更富有，感到高兴和胜利。他们认为自己很富裕，他们祝贺自己的好运，他们记得他们的父亲是如何挨饿受苦的，他们感到更好的时代已经到来。他们感谢其他人、开拓者、新主人，他们打开了矿坑，释放了丰富的资源。

But man is never satisfied, and so the miners, from gratitude to their owners, passed on to murmuring. Their sufficiency decreased with knowledge, they wanted more. Why should the master be so out-of-all-proportion rich?
但人永远不会满足，因此矿工们从对主人的感激之情转为抱怨。他们的满足感随着知识的增加而减少，他们想要更多。为什么主人会如此富有？

There was a crisis when Gerald was a boy, when the Masters’ Federation closed down the mines because the men would not accept a reduction. This lock-out had forced home the new conditions to Thomas Crich. Belonging to the Federation, he had been compelled by his honour to close the pits against his men. He, the father, the Patriarch, was forced to deny the means of life to his sons, his people. He, the rich man who would hardly enter heaven because of his possessions, must now turn upon the poor, upon those who were nearer Christ than himself, those who were humble and despised and closer to perfection, those who were manly and noble in their labours, and must say to them: ‘Ye shall neither labour nor eat bread.’
当杰拉尔德还是个孩子的时候，发生了一场危机，大师联合会关闭了矿井，因为人们不接受减产。这次停工迫使托马斯·克里奇接受了新的条件。作为联邦的一员，他迫于自己的荣誉，对他的部下关闭了坑道。他，父亲，族长，被迫剥夺他的儿子、他的人民的生活手段。他，这个因拥有财产而难以进入天堂的富人，现在必须转向穷人，转向那些比他自己更接近基督的人，那些谦卑、被轻视、更接近完美的人，那些在自己的行为上有男子气概和高尚的人。劳动，必须对他们说：“你们既不劳动，也不吃饭。”

It was this recognition of the state of war which really broke his heart. He wanted his industry to be run on love. Oh, he wanted love to be the directing power even of the mines. And now, from under the cloak of love, the sword was cynically drawn, the sword of mechanical necessity.
正是这种对战争状态的认识才真正让他心碎。他希望他的行业以爱为基础。哦，他希望爱成为矿井的引导力量。而现在，在爱的外衣下，一把剑被冷嘲热讽地拔出，一把机械必然性的剑。

This really broke his heart. He must have the illusion and now the illusion was destroyed. The men were not against HIM, but they were against the masters. It was war, and willy nilly he found himself on the wrong side, in his own conscience. Seething masses of miners met daily, carried away by a new religious impulse. The idea flew through them: ‘All men are equal on earth,’ and they would carry the idea to its material fulfilment. After all, is it not the teaching of Christ? And what is an idea, if not the germ of action in the material world. ‘All men are equal in spirit, they are all sons of God. Whence then this obvious DISQUALITY?’ It was a religious creed pushed to its material conclusion. Thomas Crich at least had no answer. He could but admit, according to his sincere tenets, that the disquality was wrong. But he could not give up his goods, which were the stuff of disquality. So the men would fight for their rights. The last impulses of the last religious passion left on earth, the passion for equality, inspired them.
这实在是伤透了他的心。他一定有幻觉，而现在幻觉被摧毁了。这些人并不是反对他，而是反对主人。这是战争，不管他愿意与否，他发现自己在良心上站在了错误的一边。狂热的矿工们每天都聚集在一起，被一种新的宗教冲动所吸引。他们心中闪过这样的想法：“地球上人人平等”，他们会将这一想法付诸实践。毕竟，这不是基督的教导吗？如果不是物质世界中行动的萌芽，那么什么是想法呢？ ‘所有人在精神上都是平等的，他们都是上帝的儿子。那么这种明显的不道德是从哪里来的呢？”这是一种宗教信条，被推导出其实质结论。托马斯·克里奇至少没有给出答案。根据他真诚的信条，他只能承认这种不公平是错误的。但他不能放弃他的货物，这些东西都是劣质的。所以男人们会为自己的权利而战。地球上最后的宗教热情的最后冲动，即对平等的热情，激励了他们。

Seething mobs of men marched about, their faces lighted up as for holy war, with a smoke of cupidity. How disentangle the passion for equality from the passion of cupidity, when begins the fight for equality of possessions? But the God was the machine. Each man claimed equality in the Godhead of the great productive machine. Every man equally was part of this Godhead. But somehow, somewhere, Thomas Crich knew this was false. When the machine is the Godhead, and production or work is worship, then the most mechanical mind is purest and highest, the representative of God on earth. And the rest are subordinate, each according to his degree.
一群群愤怒的暴徒走来走去，他们的脸像圣战一样闪闪发光，充满了贪婪的烟雾。当争取财产平等的斗争何时开始时，如何将平等的热情与贪婪的热情分开？但上帝就是机器。每个人都声称在伟大的生产机器的神性中是平等的。每个人都平等地是这个神性的一部分。但不知何故，在某个地方，托马斯·克里奇知道这是错误的。当机器是神性，生产或工作是崇拜时，那么最机械的心灵就是最纯粹、最高的，是上帝在地球上的代表。其余的都是从属的，各根据其级别。

Riots broke out, Whatmore pit-head was in flames. This was the pit furthest in the country, near the woods. Soldiers came. From the windows of Shortlands, on that fatal day, could be seen the flare of fire in the sky not far off, and now the little colliery train, with the workmen’s carriages which were used to convey the miners to the distant Whatmore, was crossing the valley full of soldiers, full of redcoats. Then there was the far-off sound of firing, then the later news that the mob was dispersed, one man was shot dead, the fire was put out.
骚乱爆发，Whatmore 坑头着火。这是这个国家最远的坑，靠近树林。士兵来了。在那个致命的日子里，从肖特兰的窗户里可以看到不远处天空中的火光，现在煤矿小火车和用来将矿工运送到遥远的瓦特莫尔的工人车厢正在穿越山谷里挤满了士兵，到处都是红衣。然后远处传来枪声，随后有消息称暴徒被驱散，一名男子被枪杀，火被扑灭。

Gerald, who was a boy, was filled with the wildest excitement and delight. He longed to go with the soldiers to shoot the men. But he was not allowed to go out of the lodge gates. At the gates were stationed sentries with guns. Gerald stood near them in delight, whilst gangs of derisive miners strolled up and down the lanes, calling and jeering:
杰拉德还是个小男孩，他内心充满了最疯狂的兴奋和喜悦。他渴望和士兵们一起去射杀那些人。但他不被允许走出小屋大门。门口站着持枪的哨兵。杰拉尔德高兴地站在他们旁边，而一群群嘲笑的矿工则在巷子里走来走去，一边喊一边嘲笑：

‘Now then, three ha’porth o’coppers, let’s see thee shoot thy gun.’ Insults were chalked on the walls and the fences, the servants left.
“那么，三个铜人，让我们看看你开枪吧。”墙壁和栅栏上都写满了侮辱，仆人们离开了。

And all this while Thomas Crich was breaking his heart, and giving away hundreds of pounds in charity. Everywhere there was free food, a surfeit of free food. Anybody could have bread for asking, and a loaf cost only three-ha’pence. Every day there was a free tea somewhere, the children had never had so many treats in their lives. On Friday afternoon great basketfuls of buns and cakes were taken into the schools, and great pitchers of milk, the school children had what they wanted. They were sick with eating too much cake and milk.
与此同时，托马斯·克里奇 (Thomas Crich) 心碎不已，并捐赠了数百英镑用于慈善事业。到处都有免费食物，而且免费食物太多了。任何人都可以要求得到面包，而一条面包只需三便士。每天都有免费的茶水，孩子们从来没有吃过这么多的款待。周五下午，一大篮子的面包和蛋糕被运进学校，还有一大罐牛奶，学童们得到了他们想要的东西。他们因吃太多蛋糕和牛奶而生病了。

And then it came to an end, and the men went back to work. But it was never the same as before. There was a new situation created, a new idea reigned. Even in the machine, there should be equality. No part should be subordinate to any other part: all should be equal. The instinct for chaos had entered. Mystic equality lies in abstraction, not in having or in doing, which are processes. In function and process, one man, one part, must of necessity be subordinate to another. It is a condition of being. But the desire for chaos had risen, and the idea of mechanical equality was the weapon of disruption which should execute the will of man, the will for chaos.
然后一切就结束了，人们又回去工作了。但一切都和以前不一样了。新的形势出现了，新的想法占据了主导地位。即使在机器里，也应该是平等的。任何部分都不应该从属于任何其他部分：一切都应该平等。混乱的本能已经进入。神秘的平等在于抽象，而不在于拥有或做，这些都是过程。在功能和过程中，一个人、一个部分必须服从另一个人。这是存在的条件。但对混乱的渴望已经上升，机械平等的理念是破坏性的武器，它应该执行人的意志，即混乱的意志。

Gerald was a boy at the time of the strike, but he longed to be a man, to fight the colliers. The father however was trapped between two halftruths, and broken. He wanted to be a pure Christian, one and equal with all men. He even wanted to give away all he had, to the poor. Yet he was a great promoter of industry, and he knew perfectly that he must keep his goods and keep his authority. This was as divine a necessity in him, as the need to give away all he possessed—more divine, even, since this was the necessity he acted upon. Yet because he did NOT act on the other ideal, it dominated him, he was dying of chagrin because he must forfeit it. He wanted to be a father of loving kindness and sacrificial benevolence. The colliers shouted to him about his thousands a year. They would not be deceived.
罢工发生时，杰拉尔德还是个孩子，但他渴望成为一个男人，与煤矿工人作战。然而，父亲却被困在两个半真半假的事实之间，心碎了。他想成为一名纯粹的基督徒，与所有人合一且平等。他甚至想把自己所有的一切都捐给穷人。然而他是工业的伟大推动者，他清楚地知道他必须保住他的财产并保持他的权威。这对他来说是一种神圣的必要性，就像放弃他所拥有的一切的需要一样——甚至更神圣，因为这是他采取行动的必要性。然而，因为他没有按照另一个理想行事，它支配了他，他懊恼得要死，因为他必须放弃它。他想成为一位充满慈爱和牺牲精神的父亲。煤矿工人对他大喊大叫，说他每年能赚到几千块钱。他们不会被欺骗。

When Gerald grew up in the ways of the world, he shifted the position. He did not care about the equality. The whole Christian attitude of love and self-sacrifice was old hat. He knew that position and authority were the right thing in the world, and it was useless to cant about it. They were the right thing, for the simple reason that they were functionally necessary. They were not the be-all and the end-all. It was like being part of a machine. He himself happened to be a controlling, central part, the masses of men were the parts variously controlled. This was merely as it happened. As well get excited because a central hub drives a hundred outer wheels or because the whole universe wheels round the sun. After all, it would be mere silliness to say that the moon and the earth and Saturn and Jupiter and Venus have just as much right to be the centre of the universe, each of them separately, as the sun. Such an assertion is made merely in the desire of chaos.
当杰拉尔德在世俗中长大后，他改变了立场。他并不关心平等。基督教的爱和自我牺牲的态度已经过时了。他知道，地位和权威是世界上正确的东西，歪曲事实是没有用的。它们是正确的，原因很简单，它们在功能上是必要的。它们不是一切，也不是最终的一切。这就像成为机器的一部分。他本人恰好是一个控制性的中心部分，而大众则是受到不同程度控制的部分。这只是事情的发生而已。我们也会因为一个中心轮毂驱动一百个外轮或因为整个宇宙围绕太阳旋转而感到兴奋。毕竟，如果说月亮、地球、土星、木星和金星与太阳一样有权利成为宇宙的中心，那就太愚蠢了。这样的断言纯粹是为了制造混乱。

Without bothering to THINK to a conclusion, Gerald jumped to a conclusion. He abandoned the whole democratic-equality problem as a problem of silliness. What mattered was the great social productive machine. Let that work perfectly, let it produce a sufficiency of everything, let every man be given a rational portion, greater or less according to his functional degree or magnitude, and then, provision made, let the devil supervene, let every man look after his own amusements and appetites, so long as he interfered with nobody.
杰拉德没有费心去思考结论，就直接下了结论。他将整个民主平等问题视为愚蠢问题而抛弃。重要的是伟大的社会生产机器。让它完美地运作，让它产生充足的一切，让每个人都得到合理的部分，根据他的功能程度或大小或多或少，然后，规定完成，让魔鬼出现，让每个人照顾他的自己的娱乐和胃口，只要他不干涉任何人。

So Gerald set himself to work, to put the great industry in order. In his travels, and in his accompanying readings, he had come to the conclusion that the essential secret of life was harmony. He did not define to himself at all clearly what harmony was. The word pleased him, he felt he had come to his own conclusions. And he proceeded to put his philosophy into practice by forcing order into the established world, translating the mystic word harmony into the practical word organisation.
于是杰拉德开始努力工作，让这个伟大的行业恢复秩序。在他的旅行和伴随的阅读中，他得出这样的结论：生命的基本秘密是和谐。他根本没有给自己明确定义什么是和谐。这个词让他很高兴，他觉得自己已经得出了自己的结论。他开始将他的哲学付诸实践，将秩序强加给既定的世界，将神秘的和谐一词转化为实际的词语组织。

Immediately he SAW the firm, he realised what he could do. He had a fight to fight with Matter, with the earth and the coal it enclosed. This was the sole idea, to turn upon the inanimate matter of the underground, and reduce it to his will. And for this fight with matter, one must have perfect instruments in perfect organisation, a mechanism so subtle and harmonious in its workings that it represents the single mind of man, and by its relentless repetition of given movement, will accomplish a purpose irresistibly, inhumanly. It was this inhuman principle in the mechanism he wanted to construct that inspired Gerald with an almost religious exaltation. He, the man, could interpose a perfect, changeless, godlike medium between himself and the Matter he had to subjugate. There were two opposites, his will and the resistant Matter of the earth. And between these he could establish the very expression of his will, the incarnation of his power, a great and perfect machine, a system, an activity of pure order, pure mechanical repetition, repetition ad infinitum, hence eternal and infinite. He found his eternal and his infinite in the pure machine-principle of perfect co-ordination into one pure, complex, infinitely repeated motion, like the spinning of a wheel; but a productive spinning, as the revolving of the universe may be called a productive spinning, a productive repetition through eternity, to infinity. And this is the Godmotion, this productive repetition ad infinitum. And Gerald was the God of the machine, Deus ex Machina. And the whole productive will of man was the Godhead.
他一看到这家公司，就意识到自己能做什么。他与物质、地球和它所包围的煤炭进行了一场战斗。这是唯一的想法，就是要开启地下无生命的物质，并把它归结为他的意志。为了这场与物质的斗争，一个人必须拥有完美的工具和完美的组织，一种运作起来如此微妙和和谐的机制，它代表了人类的单一思想，并且通过其不断重复的特定运动，将不可抗拒地、非人性地实现一个目的。 。正是他想要构建的机制中的这种非人性原则激发了杰拉尔德近乎宗教般的兴奋。他，这个人，可以在他自己和他必须征服的物质之间插入一个完美的、不变的、神圣的媒介。有两个对立面，他的意志和地球的抵抗物质。在这些之间，他可以建立他的意志的表达，他的力量的化身，一个伟大而完美的机器，一个系统，一个纯粹秩序的活动，纯粹的机械重复，无限的重复，因此永恒和无限。他在纯粹的机器原理中找到了他的永恒和无限，完美地协调成一个纯粹的、复杂的、无限重复的运动，就像车轮的旋转；但一种富有成效的旋转，正如宇宙的旋转可以被称为一种富有成效的旋转，一种富有成效的重复，直到永恒，直到无限。这就是Godmotion，这种富有成效的重复。杰拉德是机器之神，Deus ex Machina。人的全部生产性意志就是神性。

He had his life-work now, to extend over the earth a great and perfect system in which the will of man ran smooth and unthwarted, timeless, a Godhead in process. He had to begin with the mines. The terms were given: first the resistant Matter of the underground; then the instruments of its subjugation, instruments human and metallic; and finally his own pure will, his own mind. It would need a marvellous adjustment of myriad instruments, human, animal, metallic, kinetic, dynamic, a marvellous casting of myriad tiny wholes into one great perfect entirety. And then, in this case there was perfection attained, the will of the highest was perfectly fulfilled, the will of mankind was perfectly enacted; for was not mankind mystically contra-distinguished against inanimate Matter, was not the history of mankind just the history of the conquest of the one by the other?
他现在有毕生的工作，要在地球上建立一个伟大而完美的体系，在这个体系中，人的意志平稳运行，不受阻碍，永恒，一个正在发展的神性。他必须从矿井开始。给出的条件是：首先是地下的抵抗物质；然后是征服它的工具，人类和金属的工具；最后是他自己的纯粹意志，他自己的思想。它需要对无数乐器进行奇妙的调整，人类的、动物的、金属的、动力的、动态的，将无数微小的整体奇妙地铸造成一个伟大的完美整体。然后，在这种情况下，就达到了完美，最高的意志得到了完美的实现，人类的意志得到了完美的体现；因为人类难道不是与无生命的物质神秘地对立起来的吗？人类的历史不就是一者征服另一者的历史吗？

The miners were overreached. While they were still in the toils of divine equality of man, Gerald had passed on, granted essentially their case, and proceeded in his quality of human being to fulfil the will of mankind as a whole. He merely represented the miners in a higher sense when he perceived that the only way to fulfil perfectly the will of man was to establish the perfect, inhuman machine. But he represented them very essentially, they were far behind, out of date, squabbling for their material equality. The desire had already transmuted into this new and greater desire, for a perfect intervening mechanism between man and Matter, the desire to translate the Godhead into pure mechanism.
矿工们的行为太过分了。当他们还在为人类神圣平等的辛劳而努力时，杰拉尔德已经离开了，基本上同意了他们的情况，并继续以他的人类品质来实现整个人类的意志。当他意识到完美地实现人的意志的唯一方法就是建立完美的、非人性的机器时，他只是在更高的意义上代表了矿工。但他本质上代表了他们，他们远远落后，过时，为物质平等而争论。这种渴望已经转变为这种新的、更伟大的渴望，即对人与物质之间的完美干预机制的渴望，将神性转化为纯粹机制的渴望。

As soon as Gerald entered the firm, the convulsion of death ran through the old system. He had all his life been tortured by a furious and destructive demon, which possessed him sometimes like an insanity. This temper now entered like a virus into the firm, and there were cruel eruptions. Terrible and inhuman were his examinations into every detail; there was no privacy he would spare, no old sentiment but he would turn it over. The old grey managers, the old grey clerks, the doddering old pensioners, he looked at them, and removed them as so much lumber. The whole concern seemed like a hospital of invalid employees. He had no emotional qualms. He arranged what pensions were necessary, he looked for efficient substitutes, and when these were found, he substituted them for the old hands.
杰拉尔德一进入公司，死亡的痉挛就席卷了旧系统。他一生都在遭受狂怒且具有破坏性的恶魔的折磨，有时这种恶魔像精神错乱一样控制着他。现在这种脾气像病毒一样进入了公司，并发生了残酷的爆发。他对每一个细节的检查都是可怕和不人道的。他不会保留任何隐私，也不会保留旧有的情感，但他会把它改掉。那些年老的灰色经理，那些年老的灰色职员，那些年老的养老金领取者，他看着他们，然后把他们当作木材一样移走。整个公司就像是一家收容有病患的员工的医院。他没有任何情感上的疑虑。他安排了必要的养老金，寻找有效的替代品，当找到这些替代品时，他用他们来取代老手。

‘I’ve a pitiful letter here from Letherington,’ his father would say, in a tone of deprecation and appeal. ‘Don’t you think the poor fellow might keep on a little longer. I always fancied he did very well.’
“我收到了莱瑟林顿寄来的一封可怜的信，”他的父亲会用一种不赞成和恳求的语气说道。 “你不觉得这个可怜的家伙还能再坚持一会儿吗？”我一直认为他做得很好。

‘I’ve got a man in his place now, father. He’ll be happier out of it, believe me. You think his allowance is plenty, don’t you?’
“现在我有一个人代替他了，父亲。相信我，他会因此而更快乐。你觉得他的零用钱足够了，不是吗？

‘It is not the allowance that he wants, poor man. He feels it very much, that he is superannuated. Says he thought he had twenty more years of work in him yet.’
“这不是他想要的津贴，可怜的人。他深感自己已经过时了。他说他认为自己还有二十年的工作时间。

‘Not of this kind of work I want. He doesn’t understand.’
“我不想要这种工作。他不明白。

The father sighed. He wanted not to know any more. He believed the pits would have to be overhauled if they were to go on working. And after all, it would be worst in the long run for everybody, if they must close down. So he could make no answer to the appeals of his old and trusty servants, he could only repeat ‘Gerald says.’
父亲叹了口气。他不想再知道了。他认为，如果矿井要继续工作，就必须进行彻底检修。毕竟，如果他们必须关闭，从长远来看对每个人来说都是最糟糕的。所以他无法回应他的老忠实仆人的呼吁，他只能重复“杰拉尔德说”。

So the father drew more and more out of the light. The whole frame of the real life was broken for him. He had been right according to his lights. And his lights had been those of the great religion. Yet they seemed to have become obsolete, to be superseded in the world. He could not understand. He only withdrew with his lights into an inner room, into the silence. The beautiful candles of belief, that would not do to light the world any more, they would still burn sweetly and sufficiently in the inner room of his soul, and in the silence of his retirement.
于是，父亲越来越远离光明。对他来说，现实生活的整个框架都被打破了。根据他的判断，他是对的。他的光芒是伟大宗教的光芒。然而它们似乎已经过时，被世界所取代。他无法理解。他只是拿着灯退出了内室，陷入了寂静。美丽的信仰之烛，不再照亮世界，它们仍将在他灵魂的内心深处，在他退休的寂静中，甜蜜而充分地燃烧。

Gerald rushed into the reform of the firm, beginning with the office. It was needful to economise severely, to make possible the great alterations he must introduce.
杰拉尔德急忙着手公司的改革，首先从办公室开始。为了使他必须进行的重大改变成为可能，必须大力节约。

‘What are these widows’ coals?’ he asked.
“这些寡妇的煤炭是什么？”他问道。

‘We have always allowed all widows of men who worked for the firm a load of coals every three months.’
“我们一直每三个月为公司工作人员的所有遗孀提供一车煤炭。”

‘They must pay cost price henceforward. The firm is not a charity institution, as everybody seems to think.’
‘今后他们必须付出成本价。正如每个人似乎认为的那样，该公司并不是一家慈善机构。

Widows, these stock figures of sentimental humanitarianism, he felt a dislike at the thought of them. They were almost repulsive. Why were they not immolated on the pyre of the husband, like the sati in India? At any rate, let them pay the cost of their coals.
寡妇，这些感伤的人道主义的典型人物，一想到她们，他就感到厌恶。他们几乎是令人厌恶的。为什么她们不像印度的萨蒂那样被烧死在丈夫的火堆上？无论如何，让他们支付煤炭的费用。

In a thousand ways he cut down the expenditure, in ways so fine as to be hardly noticeable to the men. The miners must pay for the cartage of their coals, heavy cartage too; they must pay for their tools, for the sharpening, for the care of lamps, for the many trifling things that made the bill of charges against every man mount up to a shilling or so in the week. It was not grasped very definitely by the miners, though they were sore enough. But it saved hundreds of pounds every week for the firm.
他以一千种方式削减开支，其方式精细到人们几乎察觉不到。矿工必须支付煤炭的运输费用，甚至是重运输费用；他们必须支付工具费用、磨刀费用、灯的保养费用，以及许多琐碎的事情，这些费用使得每个人在一周内的费用达到先令左右。尽管矿工们已经够痛了，但他们并没有很明确地理解这一点。但它每周为公司节省了数百英镑。

Gradually Gerald got hold of everything. And then began the great reform. Expert engineers were introduced in every department. An enormous electric plant was installed, both for lighting and for haulage underground, and for power. The electricity was carried into every mine. New machinery was brought from America, such as the miners had never seen before, great iron men, as the cutting machines were called, and unusual appliances. The working of the pits was thoroughly changed, all the control was taken out of the hands of the miners, the butty system was abolished. Everything was run on the most accurate and delicate scientific method, educated and expert men were in control everywhere, the miners were reduced to mere mechanical instruments. They had to work hard, much harder than before, the work was terrible and heart-breaking in its mechanicalness.
渐渐地，杰拉德掌握了一切。然后开始了伟大的改革。各部门均引进了专家工程师。安装了一座巨大的发电厂，用于照明、地下运输和电力。电力被输送到每个矿井。新的机器从美国运来，比如矿工们以前从未见过的、切割机被称为“伟大的铁人”，以及不寻常的器具。矿井的工作方式发生了彻底的改变，所有的控制权都从矿工手中夺走了，巴蒂制度也被废除了。一切都按照最准确、最精密的科学方法进行，受过教育的专家在各处进行控制，矿工们沦为纯粹的机械仪器。他们必须努力工作，比以前更加努力，这项工作非常糟糕，机械性令人心碎。

But they submitted to it all. The joy went out of their lives, the hope seemed to perish as they became more and more mechanised. And yet they accepted the new conditions. They even got a further satisfaction out of them. At first they hated Gerald Crich, they swore to do something to him, to murder him. But as time went on, they accepted everything with some fatal satisfaction. Gerald was their high priest, he represented the religion they really felt. His father was forgotten already. There was a new world, a new order, strict, terrible, inhuman, but satisfying in its very destructiveness. The men were satisfied to belong to the great and wonderful machine, even whilst it destroyed them. It was what they wanted. It was the highest that man had produced, the most wonderful and superhuman. They were exalted by belonging to this great and superhuman system which was beyond feeling or reason, something really godlike. Their hearts died within them, but their souls were satisfied. It was what they wanted. Otherwise Gerald could never have done what he did. He was just ahead of them in giving them what they wanted, this participation in a great and perfect system that subjected life to pure mathematical principles. This was a sort of freedom, the sort they really wanted. It was the first great step in undoing, the first great phase of chaos, the substitution of the mechanical principle for the organic, the destruction of the organic purpose, the organic unity, and the subordination of every organic unit to the great mechanical purpose. It was pure organic disintegration and pure mechanical organisation. This is the first and finest state of chaos.
但他们屈服于这一切。随着他们变得越来越机械化，快乐消失了，希望似乎也破灭了。但他们还是接受了新条件。他们甚至还从中得到了进一步的满足。起初他们讨厌杰拉尔德·克里奇，发誓要对他做点什么，谋杀他。但随着时间的推移，他们带着某种致命的满足感接受了一切。杰拉尔德是他们的大祭司，他代表了他们真正感受到的宗教。他的父亲已经被遗忘了。出现了一个新世界，一个新秩序，严格、可怕、不人道，但其破坏性却令人满足。人们很高兴属于这台伟大而奇妙的机器，即使它摧毁了他们。这就是他们想要的。这是人类创造的最高境界、最奇妙、最超人的境界。他们因属于这个伟大而超人的系统而受到崇高的对待，这个系统超越了感觉或理性，真正像神一样。他们的心已经死了，但他们的灵魂却得到了满足。这就是他们想要的。否则杰拉尔德永远不可能做出他所做的事情。他领先于他们，给了他们想要的东西，参与了一个伟大而完美的系统，使生命服从于纯粹的数学原理。这是一种自由，是他们真正想要的自由。这是毁灭的第一步，混乱的第一个伟大阶段，机械原理取代有机原理，有机目的、有机统一的破坏，以及每个有机单元从属于伟大的机械目的。这是纯粹的有机分解和纯粹的机械组织。这是最初也是最好的混乱状态。

Gerald was satisfied. He knew the colliers said they hated him. But he had long ceased to hate them. When they streamed past him at evening, their heavy boots slurring on the pavement wearily, their shoulders slightly distorted, they took no notice of him, they gave him no greeting whatever, they passed in a grey-black stream of unemotional acceptance. They were not important to him, save as instruments, nor he to them, save as a supreme instrument of control. As miners they had their being, he had his being as director. He admired their qualities. But as men, personalities, they were just accidents, sporadic little unimportant phenomena. And tacitly, the men agreed to this. For Gerald agreed to it in himself.
杰拉尔德很满意。他知道煤矿工人说他们恨他。但他早已不再恨他们了。晚上，当他们从他身边川流而过时，沉重的靴子疲倦地在人行道上走来走去，肩膀微微扭曲，他们没有注意到他，也没有向他打招呼，他们在灰黑色的溪流中毫无感情地接受。他们对他来说并不重要，除了作为工具，他对他们来说也不重要，除了作为最高的控制工具。作为矿工，他们有自己的存在，而他也有他作为主管的存在。他很欣赏他们的品质。但作为人、作为人物，它们只是偶然、零星的、不重要的小现象。男人们也默认了这一点。因为杰拉尔德本人也同意这一点。

He had succeeded. He had converted the industry into a new and terrible purity. There was a greater output of coal than ever, the wonderful and delicate system ran almost perfectly. He had a set of really clever engineers, both mining and electrical, and they did not cost much. A highly educated man cost very little more than a workman. His managers, who were all rare men, were no more expensive than the old bungling fools of his father’s days, who were merely colliers promoted. His chief manager, who had twelve hundred a year, saved the firm at least five thousand. The whole system was now so perfect that Gerald was hardly necessary any more.
他成功了。他把这个行业变成了一种新的、可怕的纯粹。煤炭产量比以往任何时候都多，奇妙而精致的系统几乎完美运行。他拥有一批非常聪明的工程师，包括采矿工程师和电气工程师，而且他们的成本并不高。一个受过高等教育的人的花费并不比一个工人高多少。他的经理们都是稀有人物，他们的身价并不比他父亲时代那些笨手笨脚的老傻瓜贵，他们只不过是煤矿工人晋升的。他的首席经理每年有一千二百美元，为公司节省了至少五千美元。整个系统现在如此完美，杰拉德几乎不再需要了。

It was so perfect that sometimes a strange fear came over him, and he did not know what to do. He went on for some years in a sort of trance of activity. What he was doing seemed supreme, he was almost like a divinity. He was a pure and exalted activity.
它是如此完美，以至于有时他会感到一种奇怪的恐惧，他不知道该怎么办。他连续几年都处于一种恍惚的状态。他所做的事情似乎是至高无上的，他几乎就像一个神。他是一个纯洁而崇高的活动。

But now he had succeeded—he had finally succeeded. And once or twice lately, when he was alone in the evening and had nothing to do, he had suddenly stood up in terror, not knowing what he was. And he went to the mirror and looked long and closely at his own face, at his own eyes, seeking for something. He was afraid, in mortal dry fear, but he knew not what of. He looked at his own face. There it was, shapely and healthy and the same as ever, yet somehow, it was not real, it was a mask. He dared not touch it, for fear it should prove to be only a composition mask. His eyes were blue and keen as ever, and as firm in their sockets. Yet he was not sure that they were not blue false bubbles that would burst in a moment and leave clear annihilation. He could see the darkness in them, as if they were only bubbles of darkness. He was afraid that one day he would break down and be a purely meaningless babble lapping round a darkness.
但现在他成功了——他终于成功了。而最近有一两次，当他晚上独自一人无所事事时，他会突然惊恐地站起来，不知道自己在做什么。他走到镜子前，长时间地、仔细地看着自己的脸、自己的眼睛，寻找着什么。他很害怕，处于极度干燥的恐惧之中，但他不知道是怎么回事。他看着自己的脸。它就在那里，身材匀称，健康，和以前一样，但不知何故，它不是真实的，它是一个面具。他不敢碰它，生怕这只是一个构图面具。他的眼睛一如既往地蓝色、锐利，眼窝也一如既往的坚定。但他不确定它们是不是蓝色的虚假气泡，会瞬间破裂并留下明显的毁灭。他能看到它们身上的黑暗，仿佛它们只是黑暗的气泡。他担心有一天他会崩溃，成为一片毫无意义的、在黑暗中徘徊的胡言乱语。

But his will yet held good, he was able to go away and read, and think about things. He liked to read books about the primitive man, books of anthropology, and also works of speculative philosophy. His mind was very active. But it was like a bubble floating in the darkness. At any moment it might burst and leave him in chaos. He would not die. He knew that. He would go on living, but the meaning would have collapsed out of him, his divine reason would be gone. In a strangely indifferent, sterile way, he was frightened. But he could not react even to the fear. It was as if his centres of feeling were drying up. He remained calm, calculative and healthy, and quite freely deliberate, even whilst he felt, with faint, small but final sterile horror, that his mystic reason was breaking, giving way now, at this crisis.
但他的意志仍然坚定，他能够离开去读书，思考事情。他喜欢读有关原始人的书、人类学的书，也喜欢思辨哲学的书。他的思维非常活跃。但它就像一个漂浮在黑暗中的泡沫。随时都有可能爆发，让他陷入混乱。他不会死。他知道这一点。他会继续活下去，但他的意义将会崩溃，他的神圣理性将会消失。他以一种奇怪的冷漠、毫无生气的方式感到害怕。但他甚至无法对恐惧做出反应。他的感觉中心似乎正在干涸。他保持着冷静、精于算计、健康，并且相当自由地深思熟虑，尽管他带着微弱的、微小的、但最终毫无意义的恐惧感到，他的神秘理性正在崩溃，在这场危机中让位。

And it was a strain. He knew there was no equilibrium. He would have to go in some direction, shortly, to find relief. Only Birkin kept the fear definitely off him, saved him his quick sufficiency in life, by the odd mobility and changeableness which seemed to contain the quintessence of faith. But then Gerald must always come away from Birkin, as from a Church service, back to the outside real world of work and life. There it was, it did not alter, and words were futilities. He had to keep himself in reckoning with the world of work and material life. And it became more and more difficult, such a strange pressure was upon him, as if the very middle of him were a vacuum, and outside were an awful tension.
这是一种压力。他知道不存在平衡。很快他就必须朝某个方向走去，才能找到解脱。只有伯金使他完全摆脱了恐惧，通过似乎包含着信仰精髓的奇怪的流动性和多变性，使他在生活中迅速获得了满足。但杰拉尔德必须始终远离柏金包，就像离开教堂礼拜一样，回到外面的工作和生活的真实世界。就在那里，它没有改变，言语是徒劳的。他必须时刻关注工作和物质生活的世界。而且变得越来越困难，有一种奇怪的压力压在他身上，仿佛他的内心是一片真空，而外面却是一种可怕的紧张。

He had found his most satisfactory relief in women. After a debauch with some desperate woman, he went on quite easy and forgetful. The devil of it was, it was so hard to keep up his interest in women nowadays. He didn’t care about them any more. A Pussum was all right in her way, but she was an exceptional case, and even she mattered extremely little. No, women, in that sense, were useless to him any more. He felt that his MIND needed acute stimulation, before he could be physically roused.
他在女人身上找到了最令人满意的解脱。在与某个绝望的女人放荡之后，他的生活变得轻松而健忘。可恶的是，现在他很难再保持对女人的兴趣了。他不再关心他们了。普苏姆在她的方式上没什么问题，但她是一个例外，甚至她也无足轻重。不，从这个意义上来说，女人对他来说已经毫无用处了。他觉得他的心灵需要剧烈的刺激，然后他的身体才能被唤醒。

CHAPTER XVIII
第十八章

RABBIT
兔子

Gudrun knew that it was a critical thing for her to go to Shortlands. She knew it was equivalent to accepting Gerald Crich as a lover. And though she hung back, disliking the condition, yet she knew she would go on. She equivocated. She said to herself, in torment recalling the blow and the kiss, ‘after all, what is it? What is a kiss? What even is a blow? It is an instant, vanished at once. I can go to Shortlands just for a time, before I go away, if only to see what it is like.’ For she had an insatiable curiosity to see and to know everything.
古德伦知道去肖特兰对她来说是一件至关重要的事情。她知道这相当于接受杰拉尔德·克里奇为情人。尽管她因为不喜欢这种状况而犹豫不决，但她知道她会继续下去。她含糊其辞。她痛苦地回忆起那一击和那一吻，对自己说：“到底，那是什么？”什么是吻？还算什么打击？只是一瞬间，就消失了。在我离开之前，我可以去肖特兰待一段时间，哪怕只是为了看看那里是什么样子。”因为她对看到和了解一切有着永不满足的好奇心。

She also wanted to know what Winifred was really like. Having heard the child calling from the steamer in the night, she felt some mysterious connection with her.
她也想知道温妮弗雷德到底是什么样的人。夜里听到轮船里传来孩子的叫声，她感觉到与她有某种神秘的联系。

Gudrun talked with the father in the library. Then he sent for his daughter. She came accompanied by Mademoiselle.
古德伦在图书馆与父亲交谈。然后他派人去接他的女儿。她是在小姐的陪同下来的。

‘Winnie, this is Miss Brangwen, who will be so kind as to help you with your drawing and making models of your animals,’ said the father.
“温妮，这是布兰文小姐，她会很友善地帮助你画画和制作动物模型，”父亲说。

The child looked at Gudrun for a moment with interest, before she came forward and with face averted offered her hand. There was a complete SANG FROID and indifference under Winifred’s childish reserve, a certain irresponsible callousness.
孩子饶有兴趣地看了古德伦一会儿，然后她走上前，转过脸向她伸出了手。威妮弗雷德孩子气的矜持之下，透着一种彻底的冷静和冷漠，一种不负责任的冷酷。

‘How do you do?’ said the child, not lifting her face.
“你好吗？”孩子头也不抬地说。

‘How do you do?’ said Gudrun.
“你好吗？”古德伦说。

Then Winifred stood aside, and Gudrun was introduced to Mademoiselle.
然后威妮弗雷德站到一边，古德伦被介绍给小姐。

‘You have a fine day for your walk,’ said Mademoiselle, in a bright manner.
“今天是散步的好天气，”小姐高兴地说。

‘QUITE fine,’ said Gudrun.
“很好，”古德伦说。

Winifred was watching from her distance. She was as if amused, but rather unsure as yet what this new person was like. She saw so many new persons, and so few who became real to her. Mademoiselle was of no count whatever, the child merely put up with her, calmly and easily, accepting her little authority with faint scorn, compliant out of childish arrogance of indifference.
威妮弗雷德在远处看着。她似乎觉得很有趣，但又不确定这个新人是什么样的。她见到了很多新朋友，但对她来说真正的人却很少。小姐根本算不上什么，孩子只是平静地、从容地忍受着她，略带轻蔑地接受她小小的权威，出于孩子气的傲慢和冷漠而顺从。

‘Well, Winifred,’ said the father, ‘aren’t you glad Miss Brangwen has come? She makes animals and birds in wood and in clay, that the people in London write about in the papers, praising them to the skies.’
“好吧，威妮弗雷德，”父亲说，“布兰文小姐来了，你不高兴吗？她用木头和粘土制作了动物和鸟类，伦敦的人们在报纸上写下了这些动物和鸟类，对它们赞不绝口。

Winifred smiled slightly.
温妮弗雷德微微一笑。

‘Who told you, Daddie?’ she asked.
“谁告诉你的，爸爸？”她问。

‘Who told me? Hermione told me, and Rupert Birkin.’
‘谁告诉我的？赫敏告诉我的，还有鲁珀特·伯金。”

‘Do you know them?’ Winifred asked of Gudrun, turning to her with faint challenge.
“你认识他们吗？”威妮弗雷德问古德伦，转向她，带着淡淡的挑战。

‘Yes,’ said Gudrun.
“是的，”古德伦说。

Winifred readjusted herself a little. She had been ready to accept Gudrun as a sort of servant. Now she saw it was on terms of friendship they were intended to meet. She was rather glad. She had so many half inferiors, whom she tolerated with perfect good-humour.
温妮弗雷德稍稍调整了一下自己。她已经准备好接受古德伦作为仆人了。现在她明白了，他们是为了友谊而结识的。她倒是挺高兴的。她有那么多半不如人的人，她却以十足的幽默感容忍了他们。

Gudrun was very calm. She also did not take these things very seriously. A new occasion was mostly spectacular to her. However, Winifred was a detached, ironic child, she would never attach herself. Gudrun liked her and was intrigued by her. The first meetings went off with a certain humiliating clumsiness. Neither Winifred nor her instructress had any social grace.
古德伦非常平静。她也没有把这些事情当回事。对她来说，新的场合是最壮观的。然而，威妮弗雷德是一个冷漠、讽刺的孩子，她永远不会依附自己。古德伦喜欢她并对她感兴趣。第一次会议以某种令人羞辱的笨拙方式进行。威妮弗雷德和她的女老师都没有任何社交礼仪。

Soon, however, they met in a kind of make-belief world. Winifred did not notice human beings unless they were like herself, playful and slightly mocking. She would accept nothing but the world of amusement, and the serious people of her life were the animals she had for pets. On those she lavished, almost ironically, her affection and her companionship. To the rest of the human scheme she submitted with a faint bored indifference.
然而很快，他们就在一个虚构的世界里相遇了。威妮弗雷德不会注意到人类，除非他们像她一样，顽皮且略带嘲讽。她只接受娱乐的世界，而她生命中严肃的人就是她养的宠物。讽刺的是，她对这些人倾注了大量的感情和陪伴。对于人类计划的其余部分，她表现出一种淡淡的无聊冷漠。

She had a pekinese dog called Looloo, which she loved.
她养了一只哈巴狗，名叫Looloo，她很喜欢它。

‘Let us draw Looloo,’ said Gudrun, ‘and see if we can get his Looliness, shall we?’
“让我们画卢洛，”古德伦说，“看看我们能否得到他的卢洛，好吗？”

‘Darling!’ cried Winifred, rushing to the dog, that sat with contemplative sadness on the hearth, and kissing its bulging brow. ‘Darling one, will you be drawn? Shall its mummy draw its portrait?’ Then she chuckled gleefully, and turning to Gudrun, said: ‘Oh let’s!’
“亲爱的！”威妮弗雷德喊道，冲向那只狗，它坐在壁炉边，悲伤地沉思着，亲吻它凸出的额头。 ‘亲爱的，你会被吸引吗？它的木乃伊要画它的肖像吗？”然后她高兴地笑了，转向古德伦说：“哦，让我们吧！”

They proceeded to get pencils and paper, and were ready.
他们拿起铅笔和纸，做好了准备。

‘Beautifullest,’ cried Winifred, hugging the dog, ‘sit still while its mummy draws its beautiful portrait.’ The dog looked up at her with grievous resignation in its large, prominent eyes. She kissed it fervently, and said: ‘I wonder what mine will be like. It’s sure to be awful.’
“最美丽的，”威妮弗雷德抱着狗喊道，“静静地坐着，让它的妈妈画出它美丽的肖像。”狗抬起头来看着她，那双突出的大眼睛里带着悲伤的无奈。她热烈地吻着它，说道：“我想知道我的会是什么样子。”肯定会很糟糕。

As she sketched she chuckled to herself, and cried out at times:
当她画草图时，她暗自窃笑，有时还大喊道：

‘Oh darling, you’re so beautiful!’
“噢，亲爱的，你真漂亮！”

And again chuckling, she rushed to embrace the dog, in penitence, as if she were doing him some subtle injury. He sat all the time with the resignation and fretfulness of ages on his dark velvety face. She drew slowly, with a wicked concentration in her eyes, her head on one side, an intense stillness over her. She was as if working the spell of some enchantment. Suddenly she had finished. She looked at the dog, and then at her drawing, and then cried, with real grief for the dog, and at the same time with a wicked exultation:
她再次咯咯地笑着，冲过去拥抱那只狗，带着悔恨之情，仿佛她正在对他造成某种微妙的伤害。他一直坐着，黝黑、天鹅绒般的脸上带着多年来的无奈和烦躁。她慢慢地画着，眼睛里充满邪恶的专注，她的头偏向一侧，全身一片寂静。她仿佛施展了某种魔法。突然她说完了。她看了看狗，又看了看她的画，然后哭了，带着对狗的真正悲伤，同时又带着邪恶的狂喜：

‘My beautiful, why did they?’
“我的美女，他们为什么这么做？”

She took her paper to the dog, and held it under his nose. He turned his head aside as in chagrin and mortification, and she impulsively kissed his velvety bulging forehead.
她把纸拿到狗面前，放在他鼻子底下。他把头扭到一边，一副懊恼又羞愧的样子，她冲动地吻了吻他柔软的、凸出的额头。

‘’s a Loolie, ‘s a little Loozie! Look at his portrait, darling, look at his portrait, that his mother has done of him.’ She looked at her paper and chuckled. Then, kissing the dog once more, she rose and came gravely to Gudrun, offering her the paper.
‘是一个卢利，’是一个小卢齐！看看他的肖像，亲爱的，看看他的肖像，这是他母亲对他所做的。”她看着她的报纸，咯咯笑起来。然后，她再次亲吻了狗，站起身来，严肃地来到古德伦面前，把报纸递给她。

It was a grotesque little diagram of a grotesque little animal, so wicked and so comical, a slow smile came over Gudrun’s face, unconsciously. And at her side Winifred chuckled with glee, and said:
那是一幅怪诞小动物的怪诞小图，如此邪恶又如此滑稽，古德伦的脸上不自觉地慢慢露出了微笑。温妮弗雷德在她身边高兴地咯咯笑着说道：

‘It isn’t like him, is it? He’s much lovelier than that. He’s SO beautiful-mmm, Looloo, my sweet darling.’ And she flew off to embrace the chagrined little dog. He looked up at her with reproachful, saturnine eyes, vanquished in his extreme agedness of being. Then she flew back to her drawing, and chuckled with satisfaction.
‘这不像他，是吗？他比那可爱得多。他太漂亮了——嗯，卢洛，我亲爱的。”然后她飞走了，拥抱了这只懊恼的小狗。他抬起头，用责备、阴沉的眼神看着她，被自己极度苍老的状态所征服。然后她又飞回自己的画上，满意地笑了。

‘It isn’t like him, is it?’ she said to Gudrun.
“这不像他，是吗？”她对古德伦说。

‘Yes, it’s very like him,’ Gudrun replied.
“是的，这很像他，”古德伦回答道。

The child treasured her drawing, carried it about with her, and showed it, with a silent embarrassment, to everybody.
孩子珍藏着她的画，随身带着它，带着一种无声的尴尬，把它展示给大家看。

‘Look,’ she said, thrusting the paper into her father’s hand.
“看，”她说，把纸塞到父亲手里。

‘Why that’s Looloo!’ he exclaimed. And he looked down in surprise, hearing the almost inhuman chuckle of the child at his side.
“为什么那是卢卢！”他惊呼道。他惊讶地低下头，听到身边孩子近乎非人的笑声。

Gerald was away from home when Gudrun first came to Shortlands. But the first morning he came back he watched for her. It was a sunny, soft morning, and he lingered in the garden paths, looking at the flowers that had come out during his absence. He was clean and fit as ever, shaven, his fair hair scrupulously parted at the side, bright in the sunshine, his short, fair moustache closely clipped, his eyes with their humorous kind twinkle, which was so deceptive. He was dressed in black, his clothes sat well on his well-nourished body. Yet as he lingered before the flower-beds in the morning sunshine, there was a certain isolation, a fear about him, as of something wanting.
当古德伦第一次来到肖特兰兹时，杰拉德不在家。但他回来的第一天早上就一直在寻找她。那是一个阳光明媚、柔和的早晨，他在花园小径上徘徊，看着他不在期间绽放的花朵。他一如既往地干净、健康，胡子刮得干干净净，金色的头发小心翼翼地从一边分开，在阳光下闪闪发亮，金色的短胡子修剪得很整齐，眼睛里闪烁着幽默的光芒，非常具有欺骗性。他一身黑衣，衣服很好地贴合在他营养良好的身体上。然而，当他在早晨的阳光下徘徊在花坛前时，他感到某种孤立和恐惧，好像缺少什么东西。

Gudrun came up quickly, unseen. She was dressed in blue, with woollen yellow stockings, like the Bluecoat boys. He glanced up in surprise. Her stockings always disconcerted him, the pale-yellow stockings and the heavy heavy black shoes. Winifred, who had been playing about the garden with Mademoiselle and the dogs, came flitting towards Gudrun. The child wore a dress of black-and-white stripes. Her hair was rather short, cut round and hanging level in her neck.
古德伦很快就出现了，没有被发现。她穿着蓝色衣服，搭配黄色羊毛袜，就像蓝衣男孩一样。他惊讶地抬头看了一眼。她的丝袜总是让他感到不安，浅黄色的丝袜和厚重的黑鞋。威妮弗雷德一直在花园里与小姐和狗一起玩耍，她向古德伦飞快地走来。孩子穿着一件黑白条纹的衣服。她的头发很短，剪成圆形，垂在脖子上。

‘We’re going to do Bismarck, aren’t we?’ she said, linking her hand through Gudrun’s arm.
“我们要做《俾斯麦》，不是吗？”她一边说，一边把手挽住古德伦的手臂。

‘Yes, we’re going to do Bismarck. Do you want to?’
“是的，我们要做俾斯麦号。”你想要_____吗？'

‘Oh yes-oh I do! I want most awfully to do Bismarck. He looks SO splendid this morning, so FIERCE. He’s almost as big as a lion.’ And the child chuckled sardonically at her own hyperbole. ‘He’s a real king, he really is.’
‘哦，是的——哦，我愿意！我最想演《俾斯麦》。他今天早上看起来非常出色，非常凶猛。他几乎和狮子一样大了。”孩子为自己的夸张而讽刺地笑了。 “他是一位真正的国王，真的是。”

‘Bon jour, Mademoiselle,’ said the little French governess, wavering up with a slight bow, a bow of the sort that Gudrun loathed, insolent.
“祝你好，小姐，”法国小女家庭教师说，微微鞠了一躬，这是古德伦讨厌的那种鞠躬方式，无礼。

‘Winifred veut tant faire le portrait de Bismarck-! Oh, mais toute la matinee-”We will do Bismarck this morning!’-Bismarck, Bismarck, toujours Bismarck! C’est un lapin, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?’
‘威妮弗雷德 veut tant faire le Portrait de Bismarck-!哦，mais toute la matinee-“我们今天早上会做俾斯麦！”-俾斯麦，俾斯麦，toujours俾斯麦！这是一只兔子，不是吗，小姐？

‘Oui, c’est un grand lapin blanc et noir. Vous ne l’avez pas vu?’ said Gudrun in her good, but rather heavy French.
“Oui，这就是白与黑的大兔子。” “Vous ne l'avez pas vu？”古德伦用她流利但相当沉重的法语说道。

‘Non, mademoiselle, Winifred n’a jamais voulu me le faire voir. Tant de fois je le lui ai demande, ‘Qu’est ce donc que ce Bismarck, Winifred?’ Mais elle n’a pas voulu me le dire. Son Bismarck, c’etait un mystere.’
“不，小姐，温妮弗雷德不喜欢我。” Tant de fois je le lui ademande，“威妮弗雷德，你是俾斯麦吗？”Mais elle n'a pas voulu me le dire。俾斯麦之子，这是一个谜。”

‘Oui, c’est un mystere, vraiment un mystere! Miss Brangwen, say that Bismarck is a mystery,’ cried Winifred.
‘Oui，这很神秘，很神秘！布兰文小姐，说俾斯麦是个谜。”威妮弗雷德喊道。

‘Bismarck, is a mystery, Bismarck, c’est un mystere, der Bismarck, er ist ein Wunder,’ said Gudrun, in mocking incantation.
“俾斯麦，是一个谜，俾斯麦，c'est un mystere，der Bismarck，er ist ein Wunder，”古德伦用嘲讽的咒语说道。

‘Ja, er ist ein Wunder,’ repeated Winifred, with odd seriousness, under which lay a wicked chuckle.
“Ja，er ist ein Wunder，”威妮弗雷德重复道，语气里带着一种奇怪的严肃，下面是邪恶的笑声。

‘Ist er auch ein Wunder?’ came the slightly insolent sneering of Mademoiselle.
“这是奇迹吗？”小姐略带傲慢地冷笑道。

‘Doch!’ said Winifred briefly, indifferent.
“哎呀！”威妮弗雷德简短地说，漠不关心。

‘Doch ist er nicht ein Konig. Beesmarck, he was not a king, Winifred, as you have said. He was only-il n’etait que chancelier.’
“Doch ist er nicht ein Konig”。比斯马克，威妮弗雷德，正如你所说，他不是国王。他只是——il n'etait que chanchlier。

‘Qu’est ce qu’un chancelier?’ said Winifred, with slightly contemptuous indifference.
“这就是大臣吗？”威妮弗雷德说道，语气中带着一丝轻蔑的冷漠。

‘A chancelier is a chancellor, and a chancellor is, I believe, a sort of judge,’ said Gerald coming up and shaking hands with Gudrun. ‘You’ll have made a song of Bismarck soon,’ said he.
“大法官就是大法官，我相信，大法官是一种法官，”杰拉尔德走上前来与古德伦握手。 “你很快就会创作一首俾斯麦之歌，”他说。

Mademoiselle waited, and discreetly made her inclination, and her greeting.
小姐等待着，小心翼翼地表达了她的意愿，并打了招呼。

‘So they wouldn’t let you see Bismarck, Mademoiselle?’ he said.
“所以他们不让你见俾斯麦，小姐？”他说。

‘Non, Monsieur.’
“不，先生。”

‘Ay, very mean of them. What are you going to do to him, Miss Brangwen? I want him sent to the kitchen and cooked.’
‘哎呀，他们真是太卑鄙了。布兰文小姐，你要对他做什么？我想让他去厨房做饭。”

‘Oh no,’ cried Winifred.
“哦，不，”威妮弗雷德喊道。

‘We’re going to draw him,’ said Gudrun.
“我们要画他，”古德伦说。

‘Draw him and quarter him and dish him up,’ he said, being purposely fatuous.
“把他拖出来，分成四份，然后装盘。”他故意装傻地说。

‘Oh no,’ cried Winifred with emphasis, chuckling.
“哦，不，”威妮弗雷德轻笑着强调道。

Gudrun detected the tang of mockery in him, and she looked up and smiled into his face. He felt his nerves caressed. Their eyes met in knowledge.
古珍察觉到他身上带着嘲讽的味道，她抬起头，对着他的脸微笑。他感到自己的神经被抚摸着。他们的目光在知识中相遇。

‘How do you like Shortlands?’ he asked.
“你觉得肖特兰兹怎么样？”他问。

‘Oh, very much,’ she said, with nonchalance.
“哦，非常喜欢，”她漫不经心地说。

‘Glad you do. Have you noticed these flowers?’
‘很高兴你这么做。你注意到这些花了吗？

He led her along the path. She followed intently. Winifred came, and the governess lingered in the rear. They stopped before some veined salpiglossis flowers.
他领着她走在路上。她专注地跟着。威妮弗雷德来了，家庭女教师在后面徘徊。他们在一些有脉纹的水母花前停了下来。

‘Aren’t they wonderful?’ she cried, looking at them absorbedly. Strange how her reverential, almost ecstatic admiration of the flowers caressed his nerves. She stooped down, and touched the trumpets, with infinitely fine and delicate-touching finger-tips. It filled him with ease to see her. When she rose, her eyes, hot with the beauty of the flowers, looked into his.
“它们不是很棒吗？”她全神贯注地看着它们，喊道。奇怪的是，她对花朵的虔诚、近乎欣喜若狂的钦佩却抚慰着他的神经。她弯下腰，触碰着喇叭，指尖触感无限细腻。看到她，他感到很轻松。当她站起来时，她的眼睛因花朵的美丽而炽热，看着他的眼睛。

‘What are they?’ she asked.
“它们是什么？”她问道。

‘Sort of petunia, I suppose,’ he answered. ‘I don’t really know them.’
“我想是矮牵牛花，”他回答道。 “我真的不认识他们。”

‘They are quite strangers to me,’ she said.
“他们对我来说很陌生，”她说。

They stood together in a false intimacy, a nervous contact. And he was in love with her.
他们假装亲密地站在一起，紧张地接触着。他爱上了她。

She was aware of Mademoiselle standing near, like a little French beetle, observant and calculating. She moved away with Winifred, saying they would go to find Bismarck.
她意识到小姐站在附近，就像一只法国小甲虫，善于观察，精于算计。她带着威妮弗雷德搬走了，说他们会去找俾斯麦。

Gerald watched them go, looking all the while at the soft, full, still body of Gudrun, in its silky cashmere. How silky and rich and soft her body must be. An excess of appreciation came over his mind, she was the all-desirable, the all-beautiful. He wanted only to come to her, nothing more. He was only this, this being that should come to her, and be given to her.
杰拉尔德看着他们离去，一直看着穿着丝质羊绒衣服的古德伦那柔软、饱满、静止的身体。她的身体一定是多么丝滑、丰润、柔软啊。他的心中升起了一种过度的欣赏，她是最令人向往的、最美丽的。他只想到她身边，别无其他。他只是这个，这个应该来到她身边，并被给予她的存在。

At the same time he was finely and acutely aware of Mademoiselle’s neat, brittle finality of form. She was like some elegant beetle with thin ankles, perched on her high heels, her glossy black dress perfectly correct, her dark hair done high and admirably. How repulsive her completeness and her finality was! He loathed her.
与此同时，他敏锐地意识到小姐简洁而脆弱的造型。她就像一只优雅的甲虫，脚踝纤细，踩着高跟鞋，光滑的黑色连衣裙完美得体，深色的头发高高地梳着，令人赞叹。她的完整性和终结是多么令人厌恶啊！他讨厌她。

Yet he did admire her. She was perfectly correct. And it did rather annoy him, that Gudrun came dressed in startling colours, like a macaw, when the family was in mourning. Like a macaw she was! He watched the lingering way she took her feet from the ground. And her ankles were pale yellow, and her dress a deep blue. Yet it pleased him. It pleased him very much. He felt the challenge in her very attire-she challenged the whole world. And he smiled as to the note of a trumpet.
但他确实很欣赏她。她是完全正确的。当家人正在哀悼时，古德伦穿着令人震惊的颜色，像一只金刚鹦鹉，这确实让他很恼火。她就像一只金刚鹦鹉！他看着她犹豫不决地把脚从地上抬起来。她的脚踝是淡黄色的，裙子是深蓝色的。但这让他很高兴。这让他非常高兴。他从她的着装中感受到了挑战——她挑战了整个世界。他对喇叭的声音微笑。

Gudrun and Winifred went through the house to the back, where were the stables and the out-buildings. Everywhere was still and deserted. Mr Crich had gone out for a short drive, the stableman had just led round Gerald’s horse. The two girls went to the hutch that stood in a corner, and looked at the great black-and-white rabbit.
古德伦和威妮弗雷德穿过房子来到后面，那里有马厩和附属建筑。到处都是寂静而荒凉。克里奇先生出去走了一小段路，马夫刚刚牵着杰拉尔德的马。两个女孩走到角落里的小屋前，看着那只黑白相间的大兔子。

‘Isn’t he beautiful! Oh, do look at him listening! Doesn’t he look silly!’ she laughed quickly, then added ‘Oh, do let’s do him listening, do let us, he listens with so much of himself;-don’t you darling Bismarck?’
‘他不是很漂亮吗！哦，一定要看看他在听！他看起来不傻吗？”她很快笑了起来，然后又补充道，“哦，让我们让他听听吧，让我们听吧，他全神贯注地听着；——亲爱的俾斯麦，你不觉得吗？”

‘Can we take him out?’ said Gudrun.
“我们能把他带走吗？”古德伦说。

‘He’s very strong. He really is extremely strong.’ She looked at Gudrun, her head on one side, in odd calculating mistrust.
‘他非常坚强。他真的非常强大。”她侧着头，带着奇怪的、算计的不信任看着古德伦。

‘But we’ll try, shall we?’
“但我们会尝试，好吗？”

‘Yes, if you like. But he’s a fearful kicker!’
‘是的，如果你愿意的话。但他是一个可怕的踢球手！

They took the key to unlock the door. The rabbit exploded in a wild rush round the hutch.
他们拿了钥匙来开门。兔子在笼子周围疯狂地奔跑。

‘He scratches most awfully sometimes,’ cried Winifred in excitement. ‘Oh do look at him, isn’t he wonderful!’ The rabbit tore round the hutch in a hurry. ‘Bismarck!’ cried the child, in rousing excitement. ‘How DREADFUL you are! You are beastly.’ Winifred looked up at Gudrun with some misgiving in her wild excitement. Gudrun smiled sardonically with her mouth. Winifred made a strange crooning noise of unaccountable excitement. ‘Now he’s still!’ she cried, seeing the rabbit settled down in a far corner of the hutch. ‘Shall we take him now?’ she whispered excitedly, mysteriously, looking up at Gudrun and edging very close. ‘Shall we get him now?-’ she chuckled wickedly to herself.
“他有时抓得最厉害，”威妮弗雷德兴奋地喊道。 “哦，看看他，他真棒！”兔子急忙撕开了笼子。 “俾斯麦！”孩子兴奋地喊道。 ‘你真是太可怕了！你真是个畜生。”威妮弗雷德抬头看着古德伦，兴奋中带着一丝疑虑。古珍嘴角露出讽刺的笑容。威妮弗雷德发出一种奇怪的低吟声，带着莫名的兴奋。 “现在他不动了！”她喊道，看到兔子在小屋的一个角落里安顿下来。 “我们现在就带他走吧？”她兴奋而神秘地低声说道，抬头看着古德伦，慢慢靠近。 “我们现在就去找他吗？”她邪恶地自言自语道。

They unlocked the door of the hutch. Gudrun thrust in her arm and seized the great, lusty rabbit as it crouched still, she grasped its long ears. It set its four feet flat, and thrust back. There was a long scraping sound as it was hauled forward, and in another instant it was in mid-air, lunging wildly, its body flying like a spring coiled and released, as it lashed out, suspended from the ears. Gudrun held the black-and-white tempest at arms’ length, averting her face. But the rabbit was magically strong, it was all she could do to keep her grasp. She almost lost her presence of mind.
他们打开了小屋的门。古德伦伸进她的手臂，抓住了这只巨大而精力充沛的兔子，当它蹲伏着时，她抓住了它的长耳朵。它把四只脚放平，然后向后推。一阵长长的刮擦声，它被拖拽着向前，转眼间，它就在半空中，狂猛地扑来，身体如弹簧般飞扬而出，猛地猛击而出，悬挂在耳边。古珍将黑白风暴保持在一定距离之外，转开脸。但那只兔子的力量却神奇地强大，她能做的就是抓住它。她几乎失去了理智。

‘Bismarck, Bismarck, you are behaving terribly,’ said Winifred in a rather frightened voice, ‘Oh, do put him down, he’s beastly.’
“俾斯麦，俾斯麦，你的行为太糟糕了，”威妮弗雷德用一种相当害怕的声音说道，“哦，一定要把他放下来，他是个野兽。”

Gudrun stood for a moment astounded by the thunder-storm that had sprung into being in her grip. Then her colour came up, a heavy rage came over her like a cloud. She stood shaken as a house in a storm, and utterly overcome. Her heart was arrested with fury at the mindlessness and the bestial stupidity of this struggle, her wrists were badly scored by the claws of the beast, a heavy cruelty welled up in her.
古德伦站了一会儿，对她手中突然出现的雷雨感到震惊。然后她脸色大变，一股浓浓的怒火如乌云般笼罩在她身上。她站在那里，像暴风雨中的房子一样摇摇欲坠，完全被征服了。她的心因为这场斗争的盲目性和兽性的愚蠢而感到愤怒，她的手腕被野兽的爪子严重划伤，一种沉重的残忍涌上心头。

Gerald came round as she was trying to capture the flying rabbit under her arm. He saw, with subtle recognition, her sullen passion of cruelty.
当她试图抓住腋下飞翔的兔子时，杰拉尔德醒了过来。他微妙地看出了她阴沉的残忍热情。

‘You should let one of the men do that for you,’ he said hurrying up.
“你应该让其中一个人帮你做这件事，”他急忙说道。

‘Oh, he’s SO horrid!’ cried Winifred, almost frantic.
“哦，他太可怕了！”威妮弗雷德几乎疯狂地喊道。

He held out his nervous, sinewy hand and took the rabbit by the ears, from Gudrun.
他伸出紧张而有力的手，抓住古德伦手中的兔子耳朵。

‘It’s most FEARFULLY strong,’ she cried, in a high voice, like the crying a seagull, strange and vindictive.
“这是最可怕的强烈，”她大声喊道，就像海鸥的叫声，奇怪而充满报复性。

The rabbit made itself into a ball in the air, and lashed out, flinging itself into a bow. It really seemed demoniacal. Gudrun saw Gerald’s body tighten, saw a sharp blindness come into his eyes.
兔子在空中把自己变成了一个球，然后猛烈地猛击，把自己扔成了一张弓。看起来真的很恶魔。古德伦看到杰拉尔德的身体绷紧了，看到他的眼睛里闪现出锐利的失明。

‘I know these beggars of old,’ he said.
“我认识这些老乞丐，”他说。

The long, demon-like beast lashed out again, spread on the air as if it were flying, looking something like a dragon, then closing up again, inconceivably powerful and explosive. The man’s body, strung to its efforts, vibrated strongly. Then a sudden sharp, white-edged wrath came up in him. Swift as lightning he drew back and brought his free hand down like a hawk on the neck of the rabbit. Simultaneously, there came the unearthly abhorrent scream of a rabbit in the fear of death. It made one immense writhe, tore his wrists and his sleeves in a final convulsion, all its belly flashed white in a whirlwind of paws, and then he had slung it round and had it under his arm, fast. It cowered and skulked. His face was gleaming with a smile.
长长的恶魔般的巨兽再次猛击而出，在空中蔓延开来，如同飞翔一般，看上去就像一条巨龙，然后又合拢在一起，威力惊人，爆发力惊人。男人的身体因用力而剧烈颤抖。突然，一股尖锐的、白边的愤怒从他心中升起。他闪电般地后退，空着的那只手像鹰一样落在兔子的脖子上。与此同时，传来兔子因死亡而发出的诡异可憎的惨叫声。它做了一次巨大的扭动，在最后的抽搐中撕开了他的手腕和袖子，它的整个腹部在一阵旋风般的爪子中闪烁着白色，然后他把它甩到一边，快速地把它夹在腋下。它畏缩着、躲藏着。他的脸上洋溢着笑容。

‘You wouldn’t think there was all that force in a rabbit,’ he said, looking at Gudrun. And he saw her eyes black as night in her pallid face, she looked almost unearthly. The scream of the rabbit, after the violent tussle, seemed to have torn the veil of her consciousness. He looked at her, and the whitish, electric gleam in his face intensified.
“你不会认为兔子有那么大的力量，”他看着古德伦说道。他在她苍白的脸上看到了如夜色般漆黑的眼睛，她看起来几乎是超凡脱俗的。剧烈的扭打之后，兔子的尖叫声似乎撕开了她意识的面纱。他看着她，脸上泛白的电光更加强烈。

‘I don’t really like him,’ Winifred was crooning. ‘I don’t care for him as I do for Loozie. He’s hateful really.’
“我真的不喜欢他，”威妮弗雷德低声说道。 “我不像关心卢齐那样关心他。他真的很可恨。

A smile twisted Gudrun’s face, as she recovered. She knew she was revealed. ‘Don’t they make the most fearful noise when they scream?’ she cried, the high note in her voice, like a sea-gull’s cry.
当古珍恢复过来时，她的脸上露出了微笑。她知道自己的身份暴露了。 “他们尖叫的时候不是发出最可怕的声音吗？”她喊道，声音高亢，像海鸥的叫声。

‘Abominable,’ he said.
“太可恶了，”他说。

‘He shouldn’t be so silly when he has to be taken out,’ Winifred was saying, putting out her hand and touching the rabbit tentatively, as it skulked under his arm, motionless as if it were dead.
“当他必须被带出去的时候，他不应该这么傻。”威妮弗雷德伸出手，试探性地碰触兔子，兔子躲在他的腋下，一动不动，就像死了一样。

‘He’s not dead, is he Gerald?’ she asked.
“他没有死，是杰拉尔德吗？”她问道。

‘No, he ought to be,’ he said.
“不，他应该是这样，”他说。

‘Yes, he ought!’ cried the child, with a sudden flush of amusement. And she touched the rabbit with more confidence. ‘His heart is beating SO fast. Isn’t he funny? He really is.’
“是的，他应该这么做！”孩子突然高兴地红了脸，大声说道。而她摸着兔子也更有信心了。 “他的心跳得很快。他不是很有趣吗？他确实是。

‘Where do you want him?’ asked Gerald.
“你想要他去哪里？”杰拉德问道。

‘In the little green court,’ she said.
“在绿色的小庭院里，”她说。

Gudrun looked at Gerald with strange, darkened eyes, strained with underworld knowledge, almost supplicating, like those of a creature which is at his mercy, yet which is his ultimate victor. He did not know what to say to her. He felt the mutual hellish recognition. And he felt he ought to say something, to cover it. He had the power of lightning in his nerves, she seemed like a soft recipient of his magical, hideous white fire. He was unconfident, he had qualms of fear.
古德伦用奇怪的、漆黑的眼睛看着杰拉尔德，由于地狱的知识而紧张，几乎是在恳求，就像一个受他摆布的生物的眼睛，但这是他的最终胜利者。他不知道该对她说什么。他感受到了地狱般的相互认可。他觉得自己应该说点什么来掩盖这件事。他的神经里有闪电般的力量，而她似乎是他神奇而可怕的白色火焰的柔软接受者。他不自信，他有恐惧的不安。

‘Did he hurt you?’ he asked.
“他伤害了你吗？”他问。

‘No,’ she said.
“不，”她说。

‘He’s an insensible beast,’ he said, turning his face away.
“他是一头没有知觉的野兽，”他说着，转过脸去。

They came to the little court, which was shut in by old red walls in whose crevices wall-flowers were growing. The grass was soft and fine and old, a level floor carpeting the court, the sky was blue overhead. Gerald tossed the rabbit down. It crouched still and would not move. Gudrun watched it with faint horror.
他们来到小院子，院子被古老的红墙围住，墙缝里长着壁花。草地又软又细又老，球场上铺着平坦的地板，头顶上天空蔚蓝。杰拉尔德把兔子扔了下去。它蹲着一动也不动。古德伦带着淡淡的恐惧看着它。

‘Why doesn’t it move?’ she cried.
“它为什么不动？”她喊道。

‘It’s skulking,’ he said.
“它在偷偷摸摸，”他说。

She looked up at him, and a slight sinister smile contracted her white face.
她抬头看着他，苍白的脸庞上浮现出一丝阴险的笑容。

‘Isn’t it a FOOL!’ she cried. ‘Isn’t it a sickening FOOL ?’ The vindictive mockery in her voice made his brain quiver. Glancing up at him, into his eyes, she revealed again the mocking, white-cruel recognition. There was a league between them, abhorrent to them both. They were implicated with each other in abhorrent mysteries.
“这不是个傻瓜吗！”她喊道。 “这不是一个令人作呕的傻瓜吗？”她声音中的报复性嘲讽让他的大脑颤抖起来。她抬头看了他一眼，在他的眼睛里，再次露出了嘲讽的、白色的残酷的表情。他们之间存在着联盟，而他们都对此深恶痛绝。他们彼此被卷入令人憎恶的谜团之中。

‘How many scratches have you?’ he asked, showing his hard forearm, white and hard and torn in red gashes.
“你身上有多少划痕？”他问道，露出坚硬的前臂，又白又硬，还被红色的伤口撕裂。

‘How really vile!’ she cried, flushing with a sinister vision. ‘Mine is nothing.’
“真是太卑鄙了！”她喊道，看到一种邪恶的景象，脸涨得通红。 “我的什么都不是。”

She lifted her arm and showed a deep red score down the silken white flesh.
她抬起手臂，在丝质白色的肌肤上露出一道深红色的痕迹。

‘What a devil!’ he exclaimed. But it was as if he had had knowledge of her in the long red rent of her forearm, so silken and soft. He did not want to touch her. He would have to make himself touch her, deliberately. The long, shallow red rip seemed torn across his own brain, tearing the surface of his ultimate consciousness, letting through the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond, the obscene beyond.
“真是个魔鬼！”他惊呼道。但他仿佛从她前臂那道长长的红色裂缝中就了解了她，那么丝滑而柔软。他不想碰她。他必须刻意地让自己触碰她。长而浅的红色裂口似乎撕裂了他自己的大脑，撕裂了他终极意识的表面，让永远无意识的、难以想象的彼岸的红色以太穿过，那肮脏的彼岸。

‘It doesn’t hurt you very much, does it?’ he asked, solicitous.
“你伤得不太重，是吗？”他关心地问道。

‘Not at all,’ she cried.
“一点也不，”她喊道。

And suddenly the rabbit, which had been crouching as if it were a flower, so still and soft, suddenly burst into life. Round and round the court it went, as if shot from a gun, round and round like a furry meteorite, in a tense hard circle that seemed to bind their brains. They all stood in amazement, smiling uncannily, as if the rabbit were obeying some unknown incantation. Round and round it flew, on the grass under the old red walls like a storm.
突然，那只蹲着的兔子像一朵花一样安静而柔软，突然勃勃生机。它在球场上绕了一圈又一圈，就像是从枪里射出来的，像毛茸茸的陨石一样，绕着一个紧张而坚硬的圆圈，似乎束缚了他们的大脑。他们全都惊愕地站着，露出诡异的笑容，仿佛兔子在遵循着某种不为人知的咒语。它一圈又一圈地飞过，在古老的红墙下的草地上，像一场风暴。

And then quite suddenly it settled down, hobbled among the grass, and sat considering, its nose twitching like a bit of fluff in the wind. After having considered for a few minutes, a soft bunch with a black, open eye, which perhaps was looking at them, perhaps was not, it hobbled calmly forward and began to nibble the grass with that mean motion of a rabbit’s quick eating.
然后它突然安静下来，一瘸一拐地在草丛中行走，坐下来思考，鼻子像风中的绒毛一样抽动着。想了几分钟，一团柔软的东西睁着黑色的眼睛，也许正在看他们，也许没有，平静地一瘸一拐地向前走，开始用兔子快速进食的卑鄙动作啃草。

‘It’s mad,’ said Gudrun. ‘It is most decidedly mad.’
“这太疯狂了，”古德伦说。 “这绝对是疯了。”

He laughed.
他笑了。

‘The question is,’ he said, ‘what is madness? I don’t suppose it is rabbit-mad.’
“问题是，”他说，“什么是疯狂？我不认为它是兔子疯了。

‘Don’t you think it is?’ she asked.
“你不这么认为吗？”她问。

‘No. That’s what it is to be a rabbit.’
'不。这就是成为一只兔子的意义。

There was a queer, faint, obscene smile over his face. She looked at him and saw him, and knew that he was initiate as she was initiate. This thwarted her, and contravened her, for the moment.
他的脸上挂着一丝奇怪、淡淡、淫秽的微笑。她看着他，看到了他，知道他和她一样是入会者。这暂时阻碍了她，也违背了她。

‘God be praised we aren’t rabbits,’ she said, in a high, shrill voice.
“感谢上帝，我们不是兔子，”她用高亢、尖锐的声音说道。

The smile intensified a little, on his face.
脸上的笑意更浓了一些。

‘Not rabbits?’ he said, looking at her fixedly.
“不是兔子吗？”他盯着她说。

Slowly her face relaxed into a smile of obscene recognition.
慢慢地，她的脸放松下来，露出淫秽的微笑。

‘Ah Gerald,’ she said, in a strong, slow, almost man-like way. ‘-All that, and more.’ Her eyes looked up at him with shocking nonchalance.
“啊杰拉尔德，”她用一种有力、缓慢、几乎像男人的方式说道。 “——所有这些，还有更多。”她的眼睛抬头看着他，眼神中带着令人震惊的漠然。

He felt again as if she had torn him across the breast, dully, finally. He turned aside.
他再次感觉到她仿佛将他的胸口撕裂了，迟钝地，最后。他转过身去。

‘Eat, eat my darling!’ Winifred was softly conjuring the rabbit, and creeping forward to touch it. It hobbled away from her. ‘Let its mother stroke its fur then, darling, because it is so mysterious-’
“吃吧，吃吧，我亲爱的！”威妮弗雷德轻轻地召唤出兔子，并爬上前去触摸它。它一瘸一拐地离开了她。 “那就让它的妈妈抚摸它的皮毛吧，亲爱的，因为它是如此神秘——”

CHAPTER XIX
第十九章

MOONY
穆尼

After his illness Birkin went to the south of France for a time. He did not write, nobody heard anything of him. Ursula, left alone, felt as if everything were lapsing out. There seemed to be no hope in the world. One was a tiny little rock with the tide of nothingness rising higher and higher She herself was real, and only herself—just like a rock in a wash of flood-water. The rest was all nothingness. She was hard and indifferent, isolated in herself.
病愈后，柏金曾前往法国南部一段时间。他没有写信，没有人听到他的任何消息。乌苏拉独自一人，感觉一切都在崩溃。世界似乎没有希望了。其中一个是一块小小的岩石，虚无的潮水越涨越高，她自己是真实的，而且只有她自己——就像洪水中的一块岩石。其余的一切都是虚无。她冷漠、冷漠、冷漠，自我孤立。

There was nothing for it now, but contemptuous, resistant indifference. All the world was lapsing into a grey wish-wash of nothingness, she had no contact and no connection anywhere. She despised and detested the whole show. From the bottom of her heart, from the bottom of her soul, she despised and detested people, adult people. She loved only children and animals: children she loved passionately, but coldly. They made her want to hug them, to protect them, to give them life. But this very love, based on pity and despair, was only a bondage and a pain to her. She loved best of all the animals, that were single and unsocial as she herself was. She loved the horses and cows in the field. Each was single and to itself, magical. It was not referred away to some detestable social principle. It was incapable of soulfulness and tragedy, which she detested so profoundly.
现在除了轻蔑、抗拒的冷漠之外，别无他法。整个世界都陷入了一片灰色的虚无之中，她与任何地方都没有联系，也没有联系。她鄙视和厌恶整个节目。她从心底里，从灵魂深处，鄙视和厌恶人，成年人。她只爱孩子和动物：她热爱孩子，但又冷漠。他们让她想要拥抱他们，保护他们，赋予他们生命。但这种基于怜悯和绝望的爱，对她来说只是一种束缚和痛苦。她最喜欢所有的动物，这些动物和她一样单身且不合群。她喜欢田野里的马和牛。每一个都是独一无二的，而且对于自己来说，都是神奇的。它并没有被归咎于某种可憎的社会原则。它没有深情和悲剧的能力，而她对此深恶痛绝。

She could be very pleasant and flattering, almost subservient, to people she met. But no one was taken in. Instinctively each felt her contemptuous mockery of the human being in himself, or herself. She had a profound grudge against the human being. That which the word ‘human’ stood for was despicable and repugnant to her.
她对她遇到的人可能非常和蔼可亲、阿谀奉承，几乎是顺从的。但没有人被欺骗。每个人都本能地感受到她对自己或她自己的人性的轻蔑嘲笑。她对人类怀有深仇大恨。 “人类”这个词所代表的含义对她来说是卑鄙的、令人厌恶的。

Mostly her heart was closed in this hidden, unconscious strain of contemptuous ridicule. She thought she loved, she thought she was full of love. This was her idea of herself. But the strange brightness of her presence, a marvellous radiance of intrinsic vitality, was a luminousness of supreme repudiation, nothing but repudiation.
她的心大多被这种隐藏的、无意识的轻蔑嘲笑所封闭。她以为她爱过，她以为她充满了爱。这就是她对自己的想法。但她那奇异的光芒，内在生命力的奇妙光芒，却是一种至高无上的否定的光芒，只不过是否定。

Yet, at moments, she yielded and softened, she wanted pure love, only pure love. This other, this state of constant unfailing repudiation, was a strain, a suffering also. A terrible desire for pure love overcame her again.
但有时候，她会屈服、软化，她要的是纯粹的爱情，只是纯粹的爱情。这种他者，这种持续不断的否认状态，是一种压力，也是一种痛苦。对纯洁爱情的可怕渴望再次征服了她。

She went out one evening, numbed by this constant essential suffering. Those who are timed for destruction must die now. The knowledge of this reached a finality, a finishing in her. And the finality released her. If fate would carry off in death or downfall all those who were timed to go, why need she trouble, why repudiate any further. She was free of it all, she could seek a new union elsewhere.
一天晚上，她因这种持续不断的基本痛苦而麻木了，出去了。那些注定要毁灭的人现在就必须死。对这一点的认识在她身上达到了终点，终结了。最终的结局释放了她。如果命运会带走所有那些注定要离开的人的死亡或垮台，她为什么还要麻烦，为什么要进一步拒绝。她摆脱了这一切，她可以在其他地方寻求新的结合。

Ursula set off to Willey Green, towards the mill. She came to Willey Water. It was almost full again, after its period of emptiness. Then she turned off through the woods. The night had fallen, it was dark. But she forgot to be afraid, she who had such great sources of fear. Among the trees, far from any human beings, there was a sort of magic peace. The more one could find a pure loneliness, with no taint of people, the better one felt. She was in reality terrified, horrified in her apprehension of people.
乌苏拉出发前往威利格林，前往磨坊。她来到了威利水公司。在经历了一段空虚期之后，它几乎再次充满了。然后她转身穿过树林。夜幕降临，天色漆黑。但她忘记了害怕，她有如此大的恐惧来源。树林之中，远离人类，有一种神奇的平静。越能找到一种纯粹的孤独，没有人的污染，感觉就越好。事实上，她很害怕，因为她对人们的恐惧而感到恐惧。

She started, noticing something on her right hand, between the tree trunks. It was like a great presence, watching her, dodging her. She started violently. It was only the moon, risen through the thin trees. But it seemed so mysterious, with its white and deathly smile. And there was no avoiding it. Night or day, one could not escape the sinister face, triumphant and radiant like this moon, with a high smile. She hurried on, cowering from the white planet. She would just see the pond at the mill before she went home.
她吃了一惊，注意到右手上树干之间有什么东西。就像有一个伟大的存在，注视着她，躲避着她。她猛地一惊。只有月亮，透过稀疏的树林升起。但它的笑容却显得那么神秘，苍白而死气沉沉。这是无法避免的。无论白天黑夜，都无法逃脱那张阴险的脸，那张脸如这月亮般得意洋洋，笑容灿烂。她匆忙前行，躲避着这颗白色的星球。回家之前她只会看到磨坊里的池塘。

Not wanting to go through the yard, because of the dogs, she turned off along the hill-side to descend on the pond from above. The moon was transcendent over the bare, open space, she suffered from being exposed to it. There was a glimmer of nightly rabbits across the ground. The night was as clear as crystal, and very still. She could hear a distant coughing of a sheep.
因为有狗的缘故，她不想穿过院子，于是沿着山坡转向，从上面降落到池塘上。月亮高高地挂在这片光秃秃的空地上，让她很痛苦。地上有一丝夜间兔子的光芒。夜色如水晶般清澈，十分静谧。她能听到远处传来羊的咳嗽声。

So she swerved down to the steep, tree-hidden bank above the pond, where the alders twisted their roots. She was glad to pass into the shade out of the moon. There she stood, at the top of the fallen-away bank, her hand on the rough trunk of a tree, looking at the water, that was perfect in its stillness, floating the moon upon it. But for some reason she disliked it. It did not give her anything. She listened for the hoarse rustle of the sluice. And she wished for something else out of the night, she wanted another night, not this moon-brilliant hardness. She could feel her soul crying out in her, lamenting desolately.
于是她突然转向池塘上方陡峭的、树木掩映的河岸，那里的桤木盘根错节。她很高兴能进入月光下的阴凉处。她站在那儿，在倒塌的河岸顶端，手放在粗糙的树干上，看着水面，水面静谧得完美，月亮漂浮在水面上。但出于某种原因，她不喜欢这样。它没有给她任何东西。她倾听水闸沙哑的沙沙声。她希望夜晚能有别的东西，她想要另一个夜晚，而不是这月光般的坚硬。她能感觉到自己的灵魂在内心哭泣，悲凉地哀叹。

She saw a shadow moving by the water. It would be Birkin. He had come back then, unawares. She accepted it without remark, nothing mattered to her. She sat down among the roots of the alder tree, dim and veiled, hearing the sound of the sluice like dew distilling audibly into the night. The islands were dark and half revealed, the reeds were dark also, only some of them had a little frail fire of reflection. A fish leaped secretly, revealing the light in the pond. This fire of the chill night breaking constantly on to the pure darkness, repelled her. She wished it were perfectly dark, perfectly, and noiseless and without motion. Birkin, small and dark also, his hair tinged with moonlight, wandered nearer. He was quite near, and yet he did not exist in her. He did not know she was there. Supposing he did something he would not wish to be seen doing, thinking he was quite private? But there, what did it matter? What did the small priyacies matter? How could it matter, what he did? How can there be any secrets, we are all the same organisms? How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to all of us?
她看到水边有一个影子在移动。这将是柏金包。那时他不知不觉就回来了。她没有多说什么就接受了，对她来说什么都不重要。她坐在桤木树根间，昏暗而朦胧，听着水闸的声音，就像露珠在夜色中升腾的声音。岛屿一片漆黑，半隐半现，芦苇丛也是一片漆黑，只有一些芦苇反射着微弱的火光。一条鱼偷偷地一跃，露出了池塘里的光亮。这寒冷的夜晚的火焰不断地冲向纯粹的黑暗，让她感到排斥。她希望周围是完全黑暗、完美、没有噪音、没有任何动静。伯金又小又黑，头发染上了月光，他走近了一些。他离她很近，但她却不存在。他不知道她在那里。假设他做了一些他不希望被人看到的事情，认为他很私密？但那又有什么关系呢？小小的特权有什么关系呢？他做了什么又有什么关系呢？我们都是同一种生物，哪有什么秘密？当我们所有人都知道一切时，怎么可能有任何秘密呢？

He was touching unconsciously the dead husks of flowers as he passed by, and talking disconnectedly to himself.
他走过时，无意识地抚摸着死去的花壳，断断续续地自言自语。

‘You can’t go away,’ he was saying. ‘There IS no away. You only withdraw upon yourself.’
“你不能走，”他说。 ‘没有什么可走的。你只能依靠自己。

He threw a dead flower-husk on to the water.
他把一块死去的花壳扔到水面上。

‘An antiphony—they lie, and you sing back to them. There wouldn’t have to be any truth, if there weren’t any lies. Then one needn’t assert anything—‘
‘对唱——他们撒谎，你对他们唱。如果没有谎言，就不必有任何真相。那么人们就不需要断言任何事情——”

He stood still, looking at the water, and throwing upon it the husks of the flowers.
他一动不动地站着，看着水面，把花壳扔在水面上。

‘Cybele—curse her! The accursed Syria Dea! Does one begrudge it her? What else is there—?’
‘西布莉——诅咒她！该死的叙利亚迪亚！有人会嫉妒她吗？那里还有什么-？'

Ursula wanted to laugh loudly and hysterically, hearing his isolated voice speaking out. It was so ridiculous.
乌苏拉听到他孤立的声音说话，想歇斯底里地大笑。太可笑了。

He stood staring at the water. Then he stooped and picked up a stone, which he threw sharply at the pond. Ursula was aware of the bright moon leaping and swaying, all distorted, in her eyes. It seemed to shoot out arms of fire like a cuttle-fish, like a luminous polyp, palpitating strongly before her.
他站在那里，凝视着水面。然后他弯腰捡起一块石头，猛地扔到池塘里。乌苏拉意识到她眼中的明月在跳跃、摇曳，一切都扭曲了。它就像墨鱼一样射出火臂，又像发光的息肉，在她面前剧烈地跳动。

And his shadow on the border of the pond, was watching for a few moments, then he stooped and groped on the ground. Then again there was a burst of sound, and a burst of brilliant light, the moon had exploded on the water, and was flying asunder in flakes of white and dangerous fire. Rapidly, like white birds, the fires all broken rose across the pond, fleeing in clamorous confusion, battling with the flock of dark waves that were forcing their way in. The furthest waves of light, fleeing out, seemed to be clamouring against the shore for escape, the waves of darkness came in heavily, running under towards the centre. But at the centre, the heart of all, was still a vivid, incandescent quivering of a white moon not quite destroyed, a white body of fire writhing and striving and not even now broken open, not yet violated. It seemed to be drawing itself together with strange, violent pangs, in blind effort. It was getting stronger, it was re-asserting itself, the inviolable moon. And the rays were hastening in in thin lines of light, to return to the strengthened moon, that shook upon the water in triumphant reassumption.
而他的影子在池塘边，注视了一会儿，然后弯下腰，在地上摸索着。紧接着，又是一声爆响，一道绚丽的光芒，月亮在水面上炸开，化作一片片危险的白色火焰飞散开来。迅速的，如同白色的鸟儿，全部破碎的火光在池塘上腾空而起，喧闹地逃窜，与那群强行涌入的黑浪搏斗着。最远的光浪，逃了出来，似乎在对岸咆哮。为了逃避，黑暗的波浪重重地涌来，向中心涌去。但在中心，一切的心脏，仍然是一轮生动的、炽热的颤抖的白月，没有完全被摧毁，白色的火体在扭动和挣扎，甚至现在还没有破裂，还没有被侵犯。它似乎在盲目地努力中，以一种奇怪的、猛烈的剧痛将自己拉回到一起。它变得越来越强大，它正在重新发挥自己的作用，不可侵犯的月亮。光线以细细的光线迅速射入，返回到增强的月亮上，月亮在水面上以胜利的姿态重新出现。

Birkin stood and watched, motionless, till the pond was almost calm, the moon was almost serene. Then, satisfied of so much, he looked for more stones. She felt his invisible tenacity. And in a moment again, the broken lights scattered in explosion over her face, dazzling her; and then, almost immediately, came the second shot. The moon leapt up white and burst through the air. Darts of bright light shot asunder, darkness swept over the centre. There was no moon, only a battlefield of broken lights and shadows, running close together. Shadows, dark and heavy, struck again and again across the place where the heart of the moon had been, obliterating it altogether. The white fragments pulsed up and down, and could not find where to go, apart and brilliant on the water like the petals of a rose that a wind has blown far and wide.
伯金站着，一动不动地看着，直到池塘几乎平静，月亮几乎平静。然后，他对此感到满意，开始寻找更多的石头。她感受到了他无形的坚韧。又过了一会儿，破碎的光芒在她的脸上爆炸般地散开，让她眼花缭乱。然后，几乎立刻，第二声枪响了。白色的月亮跃起，破空而出。明亮的光芒四散开来，黑暗席卷了中心。没有月亮，只有破碎的光影交错的战场。黑暗而沉重的阴影一次又一次地袭击了原本是月心的地方，将它彻底抹去了。白色的碎片上下跳动，找不到去向，散落在水面上，闪闪发光，就像被风吹得很远很远的玫瑰花瓣。

Yet again, they were flickering their way to the centre, finding the path blindly, enviously. And again, all was still, as Birkin and Ursula watched. The waters were loud on the shore. He saw the moon regathering itself insidiously, saw the heart of the rose intertwining vigorously and blindly, calling back the scattered fragments, winning home the fragments, in a pulse and in effort of return.
他们又一次摇摇晃晃地向中心移动，盲目而羡慕地寻找着道路。伯金和乌苏拉注视着一切，一切又恢复了平静。岸边的水声很大。他看见月亮阴险地重聚，看见玫瑰花心猛烈地、盲目地缠绕在一起，把散落的碎片收回来，把碎片带回家，在脉搏里，在努力归来。

And he was not satisfied. Like a madness, he must go on. He got large stones, and threw them, one after the other, at the white-burning centre of the moon, till there was nothing but a rocking of hollow noise, and a pond surged up, no moon any more, only a few broken flakes tangled and glittering broadcast in the darkness, without aim or meaning, a darkened confusion, like a black and white kaleidoscope tossed at random. The hollow night was rocking and crashing with noise, and from the sluice came sharp, regular flashes of sound. Flakes of light appeared here and there, glittering tormented among the shadows, far off, in strange places; among the dripping shadow of the willow on the island. Birkin stood and listened and was satisfied.
但他并不满意。像疯子一样，他必须继续下去。他找来大石头，把它们一个接一个地扔到月亮烧着白色的中心，直到除了空洞的摇晃声之外什么也没有，池塘涌了起来，不再有月亮，只有一些破碎的东西。雪花在黑暗中纠缠在一起、闪闪发光，没有目的，也没有意义，一种黑暗的混乱，就像一个随意抛掷的黑白万花筒。空荡荡的夜晚充满了噪音，从水闸里传来尖锐、有规律的闪烁声响。远处，在陌生的地方，星星点点地出现在阴影中，闪烁着光芒。岛上柳树的滴影之中。伯金站着听着，感到很满意。

Ursula was dazed, her mind was all gone. She felt she had fallen to the ground and was spilled out, like water on the earth. Motionless and spent she remained in the gloom. Though even now she was aware, unseeing, that in the darkness was a little tumult of ebbing flakes of light, a cluster dancing secretly in a round, twining and coming steadily together. They were gathering a heart again, they were coming once more into being. Gradually the fragments caught together re-united, heaving, rocking, dancing, falling back as in panic, but working their way home again persistently, making semblance of fleeing away when they had advanced, but always flickering nearer, a little closer to the mark, the cluster growing mysteriously larger and brighter, as gleam after gleam fell in with the whole, until a ragged rose, a distorted, frayed moon was shaking upon the waters again, re-asserted, renewed, trying to recover from its convulsion, to get over the disfigurement and the agitation, to be whole and composed, at peace.
乌苏拉茫然无措，她的思绪完全消失了。她感觉自己摔在了地上，像水一样洒落在地上。她一动不动，筋疲力尽，仍然沉浸在阴暗之中。尽管现在她虽然看不见，但仍意识到黑暗中闪烁着一点点渐渐消退的光片，一簇光团秘密地绕圈跳舞，缠绕着，稳定地聚集在一起。他们再次聚集了一颗心，他们再次诞生。渐渐地，那些碎片重新聚集在一起，起伏、摇晃、跳舞、惊慌地向后倒去，但又坚持不懈地回到家，看起来像是前进时逃跑的样子，但总是闪烁着越来越近、越来越接近目标。星团神秘地变大、变亮，一道道光芒融入到整体中，直到一朵破烂的玫瑰，一颗扭曲、磨损的月亮再次在水面上摇晃，重新出现，更新，试图从抽搐中恢复过来，克服毁容和躁动，变得完整、平静、平静。

Birkin lingered vaguely by the water. Ursula was afraid that he would stone the moon again. She slipped from her seat and went down to him, saying:
伯金在水边若有所思地徘徊。乌苏拉担心他会再次向月球扔石头。她从座位上溜下来，走到他面前，说道：

‘You won’t throw stones at it any more, will you?’
“你不会再向它扔石头了，是吗？”

‘How long have you been there?’
'你到这多久了？'

‘All the time. You won’t throw any more stones, will you?’
'每时每刻。你不会再扔石头了，是吗？

‘I wanted to see if I could make it be quite gone off the pond,’ he said.
他说：“我想看看能否让它完全消失。”

‘Yes, it was horrible, really. Why should you hate the moon? It hasn’t done you any harm, has it?’
“是的，这真的太可怕了。为什么你要讨厌月亮？它没有对你造成任何伤害，不是吗？

‘Was it hate?’ he said.
“是仇恨吗？”他说。

And they were silent for a few minutes.
他们沉默了几分钟。

‘When did you come back?’ she said.
“你什么时候回来的？”她说。

‘Today.’
'今天​​。'

‘Why did you never write?’
“你为什么不写信？”

‘I could find nothing to say.’
“我找不到什么可说的。”

‘Why was there nothing to say?’
“为什么没什么可说的？”

‘I don’t know. Why are there no daffodils now?’
'我不知道。为什么现在没有水仙花了？

‘No.’
'不。'

Again there was a space of silence. Ursula looked at the moon. It had gathered itself together, and was quivering slightly.
又是一片寂静。乌苏拉看着月亮。它已经聚集在一起，并且轻微地颤抖着。

‘Was it good for you, to be alone?’ she asked.
“独自一人对你有好处吗？”她问。

‘Perhaps. Not that I know much. But I got over a good deal. Did you do anything important?’
'也许。并不是说我懂得很多。但我已经克服了很多困难。你做了什么重要的事吗？

‘No. I looked at England, and thought I’d done with it.’
'不。我看着英格兰，觉得我已经受够了。

‘Why England?’ he asked in surprise.
“为什么是英国？”他惊讶地问道。

‘I don’t know, it came like that.’
“我不知道，事情就是这样的。”

‘It isn’t a question of nations,’ he said. ‘France is far worse.’
“这不是国家的问题，”他说。 “法国情况更糟。”

‘Yes, I know. I felt I’d done with it all.’
'是的，我知道。我觉得我已经完成了这一切。

They went and sat down on the roots of the trees, in the shadow. And being silent, he remembered the beauty of her eyes, which were sometimes filled with light, like spring, suffused with wonderful promise. So he said to her, slowly, with difficulty:
他们走过去，坐在树根的阴影里。沉默着，他想起了她那双美丽的眼睛，有时充满了光芒，像春天一样，充满了美好的希望。于是他缓慢而艰难地对她说道：

‘There is a golden light in you, which I wish you would give me.’ It was as if he had been thinking of this for some time.
“你身上有一道金光，我希望你能赐予我。”他似乎已经思考这个问题有一段时间了。

She was startled, she seemed to leap clear of him. Yet also she was pleased.
她吓了一跳，似乎要从他身边跳开。但她也很高兴。

‘What kind of a light,’ she asked.
“什么样的光？”她问道。

But he was shy, and did not say any more. So the moment passed for this time. And gradually a feeling of sorrow came over her.
但他很害羞，没有再说什么。所以这一刻就这样过去了。渐渐地，一种悲伤的感觉涌上心头。

‘My life is unfulfilled,’ she said.
“我的生活并不充实，”她说。

‘Yes,’ he answered briefly, not wanting to hear this.
“是的，”他简短地回答，不想听这个。

‘And I feel as if nobody could ever really love me,’ she said.
“我觉得好像没有人能真正爱我，”她说。

But he did not answer.
但他没有回答。

‘You think, don’t you,’ she said slowly, ‘that I only want physical things? It isn’t true. I want you to serve my spirit.’
“你认为，不是吗，”她慢慢地说，“我只想要物质的东西？这不是真的。我希望你为我的精神服务。

‘I know you do. I know you don’t want physical things by themselves. But, I want you to give me—to give your spirit to me—that golden light which is you—which you don’t know—give it me—‘
“我知道你会的。”我知道你不想要物质的东西本身。但是，我希望你给我——把你的灵魂给我——那金色的光芒，就是你——你不知道——把它给我——”

After a moment’s silence she replied:
沉默片刻后，她回答道：

‘But how can I, you don’t love me! You only want your own ends. You don’t want to serve ME, and yet you want me to serve you. It is so one-sided!’
‘可是我怎么能，你不爱我！你只想达到你自己的目的。你不想服务我，却又想让我服务你。这太片面了！

It was a great effort to him to maintain this conversation, and to press for the thing he wanted from her, the surrender of her spirit.
他付出了巨大的努力才能维持这次谈话，并敦促她得到他想要的东西，即她的精神的屈服。

‘It is different,’ he said. ‘The two kinds of service are so different. I serve you in another way—not through YOURSELF—somewhere else. But I want us to be together without bothering about ourselves—to be really together because we ARE together, as if it were a phenomenon, not a not a thing we have to maintain by our own effort.’
“这是不同的，”他说。 “这两种服务非常不同。我以另一种方式为你服务——不是通过你自己——在其他地方。但我希望我们在一起，不用担心自己——真正在一起，因为我们在一起，就好像这是一种现象，而不是我们必须靠自己的努力来维持的东西。

‘No,’ she said, pondering. ‘You are just egocentric. You never have any enthusiasm, you never come out with any spark towards me. You want yourself, really, and your own affairs. And you want me just to be there, to serve you.’
“不，”她沉思着说道。 ‘你只是以自我为中心。你从来没有任何热情，你从来没有对我迸发出任何火花。你真的想要你自己，以及你自己的事情。你希望我就在那里，为你服务。

But this only made him shut off from her.
但这只会让他与她隔绝。

‘Ah well,’ he said, ‘words make no matter, any way. The thing IS between us, or it isn’t.’
“啊，好吧，”他说，“无论如何，言语无关紧要。”这件事是我们之间的事情，或者不是。”

‘You don’t even love me,’ she cried.
“你根本不爱我，”她哭道。

‘I do,’ he said angrily. ‘But I want—‘ His mind saw again the lovely golden light of spring transfused through her eyes, as through some wonderful window. And he wanted her to be with him there, in this world of proud indifference. But what was the good of telling her he wanted this company in proud indifference. What was the good of talking, any way? It must happen beyond the sound of words. It was merely ruinous to try to work her by conviction. This was a paradisal bird that could never be netted, it must fly by itself to the heart.
“我愿意，”他愤怒地说。 “但我想要——”他的脑海里再次看到春天可爱的金色光芒从她的眼睛里注入，就像透过一扇奇妙的窗户一样。他希望她能和他在一起，在这个傲慢冷漠的世界里。但高傲而冷漠地告诉她他想要这家公司又有什么用呢？说话有什么好处呢？它一定会发生在言语之外。试图用信念来激励她只会带来毁灭性的后果。这是一只永远无法被网捕捉到的天堂鸟，它必须自己飞向心脏。

‘I always think I am going to be loved—and then I am let down. You DON’T love me, you know. You don’t want to serve me. You only want yourself.’
“我总是以为我会被爱——然后我就感到失望。你不爱我，你知道。你不想为我服务。你只想要你自己。

A shiver of rage went over his veins, at this repeated: ‘You don’t want to serve me.’ All the paradisal disappeared from him.
他的血管里一阵愤怒的颤抖，他重复道：“你不想为我服务。”所有的天堂都从他身上消失了。

‘No,’ he said, irritated, ‘I don’t want to serve you, because there is nothing there to serve. What you want me to serve, is nothing, mere nothing. It isn’t even you, it is your mere female quality. And I wouldn’t give a straw for your female ego—it’s a rag doll.’
“不，”他生气地说，“我不想为你服务，因为那里没有什么可以服务的。”你要我服务的，什么也不是，什么也不是。甚至不是你，这只是你的女性品质。我不会为你的女性自尊心付出任何代价——它只是一个布娃娃。

‘Ha!’ she laughed in mockery. ‘That’s all you think of me, is it? And then you have the impudence to say you love me.’
“哈！”她嘲讽地笑道。 ‘这就是你对我的看法，是吗？然后你就厚颜无耻地说你爱我。

She rose in anger, to go home.
她一怒之下起身，要回家。

You want the paradisal unknowing,’ she said, turning round on him as he still sat half-visible in the shadow. ‘I know what that means, thank you. You want me to be your thing, never to criticise you or to have anything to say for myself. You want me to be a mere THING for you! No thank you! IF you want that, there are plenty of women who will give it to you. There are plenty of women who will lie down for you to walk over them—GO to them then, if that’s what you want—go to them.’
你想要在不知情的情况下进入天堂，”她转过身看着他，因为他仍然坐在阴影中，隐约可见。 “我知道这意味着什么，谢谢。你希望我成为你的事，永远不要批评你或为自己说些什么。你想让我成为你的一个东西！不，谢谢！如果你想要的话，有很多女人会给你。有很多女人会躺下来让你从她们身上走过——那就去找她们吧，如果你想要的话——去找她们。”

‘No,’ he said, outspoken with anger. ‘I want you to drop your assertive WILL, your frightened apprehensive self-insistence, that is what I want. I want you to trust yourself so implicitly, that you can let yourself go.’
“不，”他愤怒地说。 ‘我希望你放弃你的坚定意志，你害怕的、忧虑的自我坚持，这就是我想要的。我希望你完全相信自己，这样你就可以放手。

‘Let myself go!’ she re-echoed in mockery. ‘I can let myself go, easily enough. It is you who can’t let yourself go, it is you who hang on to yourself as if it were your only treasure. YOU—YOU are the Sunday school teacher—YOU—you preacher.’
“放开我自己吧！”她再次嘲笑道。 “我可以轻松地放开自己。是你放不下自己，是你把自己当成唯一的宝藏。你——你是主日学老师——你——你传教士。

The amount of truth that was in this made him stiff and unheeding of her.
这话里的真相让他变得僵硬，对她视而不见。

‘I don’t mean let yourself go in the Dionysic ecstatic way,’ he said. ‘I know you can do that. But I hate ecstasy, Dionysic or any other. It’s like going round in a squirrel cage. I want you not to care about yourself, just to be there and not to care about yourself, not to insist—be glad and sure and indifferent.’
“我的意思并不是让自己以酒神狂喜的方式去，”他说。 ‘我知道你能做到。但我讨厌狂喜、酒神或其他任何形式。就像在松鼠笼里转来转去一样。我希望你不要关心自己，只是在那里，不要关心自己，不要坚持——要高兴、确定、冷漠。

‘Who insists?’ she mocked. ‘Who is it that keeps on insisting? It isn’t ME!’
“谁坚持呢？”她嘲笑道。 ‘到底是谁一直坚持？这不是我！

There was a weary, mocking bitterness in her voice. He was silent for some time.
她的声音里带着疲倦、嘲讽的苦涩。他沉默了一段时间。

‘I know,’ he said. ‘While ever either of us insists to the other, we are all wrong. But there we are, the accord doesn’t come.’
“我知道，”他说。 “虽然我们中的任何一方都坚持对方，但我们都错了。但我们却没有达成协议。

They sat in stillness under the shadow of the trees by the bank. The night was white around them, they were in the darkness, barely conscious.
他们静静地坐在岸边的树荫下。周围的夜色一片漆黑，他们在黑暗中，几乎没有知觉。

Gradually, the stillness and peace came over them. She put her hand tentatively on his. Their hands clasped softly and silently, in peace.
渐渐地，安静与平和笼罩着他们。她试探性地将手放在他的手上。他们的手轻轻地、无声地、平静地握在一起。

‘Do you really love me?’ she said.
“你真的爱我吗？”她说。

He laughed.
他笑了。

‘I call that your war-cry,’ he replied, amused.
“我把这称为你的战争口号，”他有趣地回答道。

‘Why!’ she cried, amused and really wondering.
“为什么！”她叫道，既觉得好笑，又很想知道。

‘Your insistence—Your war-cry—‘A Brangwen, A Brangwen’—an old battle-cry. Yours is, ‘Do you love me? Yield knave, or die.‘‘
“你的坚持——你的战斗口号——‘布朗温，布朗温’——古老的战斗口号。你的问题是‘你爱我吗？屈服无赖，否则死。”

‘No,’ she said, pleading, ‘not like that. Not like that. But I must know that you love me, mustn’t I?’
“不，”她恳求道，“不是那样的。”不是这样的。但我必须知道你爱我，不是吗？

‘Well then, know it and have done with it.’
“那么，知道了，就结束了。”

‘But do you?’
“但是你呢？”

‘Yes, I do. I love you, and I know it’s final. It is final, so why say any more about it.’
'是的，我愿意。我爱你，我知道这是最终的决定。这是最终决定，所以为什么还要多说呢？

She was silent for some moments, in delight and doubt.
她沉默了一会儿，既高兴又疑惑。

‘Are you sure?’ she said, nestling happily near to him.
“你确定吗？”她高兴地依偎在他身边说道。

‘Quite sure—so now have done—accept it and have done.’
“非常确定——所以现在已经完成了——接受它并完成了。”

She was nestled quite close to him.
她依偎着他，离他很近。

‘Have done with what?’ she murmured, happily.
“完成什么了吗？”她高兴地低声说道。

‘With bothering,’ he said.
“很麻烦，”他说。

She clung nearer to him. He held her close, and kissed her softly, gently. It was such peace and heavenly freedom, just to fold her and kiss her gently, and not to have any thoughts or any desires or any will, just to be still with her, to be perfectly still and together, in a peace that was not sleep, but content in bliss. To be content in bliss, without desire or insistence anywhere, this was heaven: to be together in happy stillness.
她离他更近了。他紧紧地抱住她，轻轻地、温柔地吻着她。那是多么的平静和天堂般的自由，只是把她抱起来，轻轻地亲吻她，没有任何想法、任何欲望或任何意志，只是静静地和她在一起，完全安静地在一起，在一种不存在的平静中。睡眠，但满足于幸福。满足于幸福，没有任何欲望或坚持，这就是天堂：在幸福的宁静中在一起。

For a long time she nestled to him, and he kissed her softly, her hair, her face, her ears, gently, softly, like dew falling. But this warm breath on her ears disturbed her again, kindled the old destructive fires. She cleaved to him, and he could feel his blood changing like quicksilver.
她依偎在他身边良久，他轻轻地吻着她，她的头发，她的脸，她的耳朵，轻轻地，轻柔地，如露珠飘落。但耳边这股温暖的气息再次扰乱了她，点燃了旧日的毁灭之火。她紧贴着他，他能感觉到自己的血液像水银一样变化。

‘But we’ll be still, shall we?’ he said.
“但我们会保持安静，不是吗？”他说。

‘Yes,’ she said, as if submissively.
“是的，”她说道，仿佛顺从。

And she continued to nestle against him.
而她继续依偎在他身边。

But in a little while she drew away and looked at him.
但过了一会儿，她就躲开了，看着他。

‘I must be going home,’ she said.
“我得回家了，”她说。

‘Must you—how sad,’ he replied.
“你一定要——多么悲伤啊，”他回答道。

She leaned forward and put up her mouth to be kissed.
她倾身向前，抬起嘴等待被吻。

‘Are you really sad?’ she murmured, smiling.
“你真的很难过吗？”她微笑着低声说道。

‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I wish we could stay as we were, always.’
“是的，”他说，“我希望我们能一直保持原样。”

‘Always! Do you?’ she murmured, as he kissed her. And then, out of a full throat, she crooned ‘Kiss me! Kiss me!’ And she cleaved close to him. He kissed her many times. But he too had his idea and his will. He wanted only gentle communion, no other, no passion now. So that soon she drew away, put on her hat and went home.
'总是！你是吗？”当他吻她时，她低声说道。然后，她从满是喉咙的地方低吟着“吻我！”吻我！”她紧紧地贴着他。他吻了她很多次。但他也有他的想法和意志。他现在只想要温柔的交流，没有其他，没有激情。于是她很快就离开了，戴上帽子回家了。

The next day however, he felt wistful and yearning. He thought he had been wrong, perhaps. Perhaps he had been wrong to go to her with an idea of what he wanted. Was it really only an idea, or was it the interpretation of a profound yearning? If the latter, how was it he was always talking about sensual fulfilment? The two did not agree very well.
然而第二天，他却感到了渴望和渴望。他认为他可能错了。也许他带着自己想要的想法去找她是错误的。这真的只是一个想法，还是一种深刻向往的诠释？如果是后者，他怎么总是谈论感官的满足？两人意见不太一致。

Suddenly he found himself face to face with a situation. It was as simple as this: fatally simple. On the one hand, he knew he did not want a further sensual experience—something deeper, darker, than ordinary life could give. He remembered the African fetishes he had seen at Halliday’s so often. There came back to him one, a statuette about two feet high, a tall, slim, elegant figure from West Africa, in dark wood, glossy and suave. It was a woman, with hair dressed high, like a melon-shaped dome. He remembered her vividly: she was one of his soul’s intimates. Her body was long and elegant, her face was crushed tiny like a beetle’s, she had rows of round heavy collars, like a column of quoits, on her neck. He remembered her: her astonishing cultured elegance, her diminished, beetle face, the astounding long elegant body, on short, ugly legs, with such protuberant buttocks, so weighty and unexpected below her slim long loins. She knew what he himself did not know. She had thousands of years of purely sensual, purely unspiritual knowledge behind her. It must have been thousands of years since her race had died, mystically: that is, since the relation between the senses and the outspoken mind had broken, leaving the experience all in one sort, mystically sensual. Thousands of years ago, that which was imminent in himself must have taken place in these Africans: the goodness, the holiness, the desire for creation and productive happiness must have lapsed, leaving the single impulse for knowledge in one sort, mindless progressive knowledge through the senses, knowledge arrested and ending in the senses, mystic knowledge in disintegration and dissolution, knowledge such as the beetles have, which live purely within the world of corruption and cold dissolution. This was why her face looked like a beetle’s: this was why the Egyptians worshipped the ball-rolling scarab: because of the principle of knowledge in dissolution and corruption.
突然，他发现自己面临着一个境况。事情就这么简单：极其简单。一方面，他知道自己不想要更多的感官体验——比平常生活所能给予的更深刻、更黑暗的东西。他记得他经常在哈利迪餐厅看到的非洲崇拜物。他回到了一个雕像，一尊约两英尺高的小雕像，是一个来自西非的高大、苗条、优雅的人物，采用深色木材制成，光滑而温文尔雅。那是一个女人，头发梳得高高的，像一个瓜形的圆顶。他清楚地记得她：她是他灵魂的知己之一。她的身体修长而优雅，她的脸被压得像甲虫一样小，脖子上有一排又圆又重的项圈，就像一列绕圈一样。他记得她：她令人惊叹的优雅气质，她那缩小的甲虫脸，令人惊叹的修长优雅的身体，短而丑陋的腿，如此突出的臀部，在她细长的腰部下面如此沉重和出乎意料。她知道他自己不知道的事情。她背后有几千年纯粹感性、纯粹非精神的知识。自从她的种族神秘地消亡以来，肯定已经有数千年了：也就是说，自从感官与直言不讳的心灵之间的关系破裂以来，所有的体验都只剩下一种神秘的感性。几千年前，他身上迫在眉睫的事情一定已经在这些非洲人身上发生了：善良、神圣、对创造和生产性幸福的渴望一定已经消失，留下了一种求知的单一冲动，通过无意识的进步知识。感官，知识在感官中被逮捕和终结，神秘的知识在瓦解和溶解中，像甲虫那样的知识，纯粹生活在腐败和冰冷溶解的世界中。 这就是为什么她的脸看起来像甲虫的原因：这就是埃及人崇拜滚球圣甲虫的原因：因为溶解和腐败的知识原理。

There is a long way we can travel, after the death-break: after that point when the soul in intense suffering breaks, breaks away from its organic hold like a leaf that falls. We fall from the connection with life and hope, we lapse from pure integral being, from creation and liberty, and we fall into the long, long African process of purely sensual understanding, knowledge in the mystery of dissolution.
在死亡破裂之后，我们还有很长的路要走：在那之后，当灵魂在剧烈的痛苦中破裂，像一片落叶一样脱离其有机的束缚。我们脱离了与生命和希望的联系，我们脱离了纯粹的整体存在，脱离了创造和自由，我们陷入了漫长的非洲纯粹感性理解的过程，以及消解神秘中的知识。

He realised now that this is a long process—thousands of years it takes, after the death of the creative spirit. He realised that there were great mysteries to be unsealed, sensual, mindless, dreadful mysteries, far beyond the phallic cult. How far, in their inverted culture, had these West Africans gone beyond phallic knowledge? Very, very far. Birkin recalled again the female figure: the elongated, long, long body, the curious unexpected heavy buttocks, he long, imprisoned neck, the face with tiny features like a beetle’s. This was far beyond any phallic knowledge, sensual subtle realities far beyond the scope of phallic investigation.
他现在意识到，这是一个漫长的过程——在创造精神死亡之后，需要数千年的时间。他意识到有一些伟大的奥秘需要解开，那些感性的、无意识的、可怕的奥秘，远远超出了阳具崇拜。在他们颠倒的文化中，这些西非人超越了阳具知识有多远？非常非常远。伯金再次回忆起了女性的形象：修长、长长的身体，奇怪的、意想不到的沉重臀部，长长的、被囚禁的脖子，脸上有像甲虫一样的微小特征。这远远超出了任何阳具知识，感官微妙的现实也远远超出了阳具调查的范围。

There remained this way, this awful African process, to be fulfilled. It would be done differently by the white races. The white races, having the arctic north behind them, the vast abstraction of ice and snow, would fulfil a mystery of ice-destructive knowledge, snow-abstract annihilation. Whereas the West Africans, controlled by the burning death-abstraction of the Sahara, had been fulfilled in sun-destruction, the putrescent mystery of sun-rays.
这个可怕的非洲进程还有待完成。白人会采取不同的做法。白种人背靠北极，拥有广阔的冰雪抽象，将实现冰破坏知识、雪抽象毁灭的奥秘。而西非人则受到撒哈拉沙漠燃烧的死亡抽象的控制，在太阳毁灭中实现了太阳光线腐烂的神秘。

Was this then all that remained? Was there left now nothing but to break off from the happy creative being, was the time up? Is our day of creative life finished? Does there remain to us only the strange, awful afterwards of the knowledge in dissolution, the African knowledge, but different in us, who are blond and blue-eyed from the north?
这就是剩下的一切了吗？现在除了与快乐的创造性存在断绝别无他法了吗？时间到了吗？我们的创意生活结束了吗？我们是否只剩下奇怪的、可怕的解体之后的知识，非洲的知识，但在我们这些来自北方的金发碧眼的人身上却有所不同？

Birkin thought of Gerald. He was one of these strange white wonderful demons from the north, fulfilled in the destructive frost mystery. And was he fated to pass away in this knowledge, this one process of frost-knowledge, death by perfect cold? Was he a messenger, an omen of the universal dissolution into whiteness and snow?
伯金想到了杰拉德。他是来自北方的奇怪的白色奇妙恶魔之一，在毁灭性的冰霜之谜中得到了实现。他是否注定要在这种知识中死去，在这种冰霜知识的过程中，在完全寒冷中死亡？他是一个使者，一个宇宙将化为白雪的预兆吗？

Birkin was frightened. He was tired too, when he had reached this length of speculation. Suddenly his strange, strained attention gave way, he could not attend to these mysteries any more. There was another way, the way of freedom. There was the paradisal entry into pure, single being, the individual soul taking precedence over love and desire for union, stronger than any pangs of emotion, a lovely state of free proud singleness, which accepted the obligation of the permanent connection with others, and with the other, submits to the yoke and leash of love, but never forfeits its own proud individual singleness, even while it loves and yields.
伯金很害怕。当他进行了这么长的猜测时，他也累了。突然间，他奇怪的、紧张的注意力消失了，他无法再关注这些谜团了。还有另一条路，那就是自由之路。这是进入纯粹、单一存在的天堂，个人灵魂优先于爱和结合的愿望，比任何情感的痛苦都强烈，这是一种自由自豪的单身的可爱状态，它接受了与他人永久联系的义务，并且与另一个人一起，服从于爱的枷锁和束缚，但永远不会放弃自己自豪的个体单身性，即使它爱和屈服。

There was the other way, the remaining way. And he must run to follow it. He thought of Ursula, how sensitive and delicate she really was, her skin so over-fine, as if one skin were wanting. She was really so marvellously gentle and sensitive. Why did he ever forget it? He must go to her at once. He must ask her to marry him. They must marry at once, and so make a definite pledge, enter into a definite communion. He must set out at once and ask her, this moment. There was no moment to spare.
还有另一条路，剩下的路。他必须跑去追随它。他想到了乌苏拉，她真的是多么的敏感和娇嫩，她的皮肤是那么的细腻，好像还缺一层皮肤。她真的是非常的温柔和敏感。为什么他会忘记呢？他必须立刻去找她。他必须向她求婚。他们必须立即结婚，并做出明确的承诺，进入明确的共融。他必须立刻出发去问她，就在这个时候。没有空闲的时间。

He drifted on swiftly to Beldover, half-unconscious of his own movement. He saw the town on the slope of the hill, not straggling, but as if walled-in with the straight, final streets of miners’ dwellings, making a great square, and it looked like Jerusalem to his fancy. The world was all strange and transcendent.
他迅速朝贝尔多弗走去，几乎没有意识到自己的动作。他看到山坡上的小镇并不散乱，而是像围墙一样，与矿工住宅最后笔直的街道围成一个巨大的广场，在他的想象中，它看起来就像耶路撒冷。世界一切都是陌生而超然的。

Rosalind opened the door to him. She started slightly, as a young girl will, and said:
罗莎琳德给他开门。她像一个年轻女孩一样，微微吃了一惊，说道：

‘Oh, I’ll tell father.’
“哦，我会告诉父亲的。”

With which she disappeared, leaving Birkin in the hall, looking at some reproductions from Picasso, lately introduced by Gudrun. He was admiring the almost wizard, sensuous apprehension of the earth, when Will Brangwen appeared, rolling down his shirt sleeves.
说完她就消失了，把伯金留在大厅里，看着戈德伦最近介绍的一些毕加索的复制品。当威尔·布兰文出现时，他正欣赏着大地那近乎巫师般的、感性的忧虑，他卷起了衬衫袖子。

‘Well,’ said Brangwen, ‘I’ll get a coat.’ And he too disappeared for a moment. Then he returned, and opened the door of the drawing-room, saying:
“好吧，”布兰文说，“我去拿一件外套。”然后他也消失了一会儿。然后他回来了，打开客厅的门，说道：

‘You must excuse me, I was just doing a bit of work in the shed. Come inside, will you.’
“请原谅，我只是在棚屋里做了一些工作。进来吧，好吗？

Birkin entered and sat down. He looked at the bright, reddish face of the other man, at the narrow brow and the very bright eyes, and at the rather sensual lips that unrolled wide and expansive under the black cropped moustache. How curious it was that this was a human being! What Brangwen thought himself to be, how meaningless it was, confronted with the reality of him. Birkin could see only a strange, inexplicable, almost patternless collection of passions and desires and suppressions and traditions and mechanical ideas, all cast unfused and disunited into this slender, bright-faced man of nearly fifty, who was as unresolved now as he was at twenty, and as uncreated. How could he be the parent of Ursula, when he was not created himself. He was not a parent. A slip of living flesh had been transmitted through him, but the spirit had not come from him. The spirit had not come from any ancestor, it had come out of the unknown. A child is the child of the mystery, or it is uncreated.
伯金进来坐下。他看着另一个男人那张明亮、泛红的脸，看着那窄窄的眉毛和非常明亮的眼睛，还有那张在黑色短胡子下张开的相当性感的嘴唇。多么奇怪，这是一个人类！布兰文所认为的自己是多么的毫无意义，面对他的现实。伯金只能看到一种奇怪的、莫名其妙的、几乎没有模式的激情、欲望、压抑、传统和机械观念的集合，所有这些都未融合和分散在这个身材苗条、面容明亮的年近五十的男人身上，他现在和以前一样没有决心。二十岁，并且是非受造的。当他不是自己创造出来的时候，他怎么可能是乌苏拉的父母呢？他不是父母。活生生的肉身已经通过他传了过来，但灵却不是从他身上发出来的。灵魂并非来自任何祖先，而是来自未知。孩子是神秘的孩子，或者说它是非创造的。

‘The weather’s not so bad as it has been,’ said Brangwen, after waiting a moment. There was no connection between the two men.
“天气没有以前那么糟糕了，”布兰文等了一会儿后说道。这两个人之间没有任何联系。

‘No,’ said Birkin. ‘It was full moon two days ago.’
“不，”伯金说。 “两天前是满月。”

‘Oh! You believe in the moon then, affecting the weather?’
'哦！那么你相信月亮会影响天气吗？

‘No, I don’t think I do. I don’t really know enough about it.’
“不，我不这么认为。我对此了解还不够。

‘You know what they say? The moon and the weather may change together, but the change of the moon won’t change the weather.’
'你知道他们说了什么？月亮和天气可能会一起变化，但月亮的变化不会改变天气。

‘Is that it?’ said Birkin. ‘I hadn’t heard it.’
“是这样吗？”伯金说。 “我没听到。”

There was a pause. Then Birkin said:
一阵停顿。然后伯金说：

‘Am I hindering you? I called to see Ursula, really. Is she at home?’
‘我妨碍你了吗？我真的打电话来见乌苏拉。她在家吗？'

‘I don’t believe she is. I believe she’s gone to the library. I’ll just see.’
“我不相信她是这样。我相信她去了图书馆。我看看。

Birkin could hear him enquiring in the dining-room.
伯金能听到他在餐厅里询问。

‘No,’ he said, coming back. ‘But she won’t be long. You wanted to speak to her?’
“不，”他回来后说道。 '但她不会呆太久。你想和她说话吗？

Birkin looked across at the other man with curious calm, clear eyes.
伯金用好奇、平静、清澈的眼睛看着对面的另一个人。

‘As a matter of fact,’ he said, ‘I wanted to ask her to marry me.’
“事实上，”他说，“我想向她求婚。”

A point of light came on the golden-brown eyes of the elder man.
老者金褐色的眼眸中，闪现出一丝光芒。

‘O-oh?’ he said, looking at Birkin, then dropping his eyes before the calm, steadily watching look of the other: ‘Was she expecting you then?’
“哦——哦？”他看着伯金说道，然后低下头看着对方平静而坚定的目光：“那么她是在等你吗？”

‘No,’ said Birkin.
“不，”伯金说。

‘No? I didn’t know anything of this sort was on foot—‘ Brangwen smiled awkwardly.
'不？我不知道这种东西是步行的——”布兰文尴尬地笑了笑。

Birkin looked back at him, and said to himself: ‘I wonder why it should be ‘on foot’!’ Aloud he said:
伯金回头看着他，自言自语道：“我不知道为什么要‘步行’！”他大声说道：

‘No, it’s perhaps rather sudden.’ At which, thinking of his relationship with Ursula, he added—‘but I don’t know—‘
“不，这也许相当突然。”想到他和乌苏拉的关系，他补充道——“但我不知道——”

‘Quite sudden, is it? Oh!’ said Brangwen, rather baffled and annoyed.
‘很突然，是吗？哦！”布兰文显得相当困惑和恼火。

‘In one way,’ replied Birkin, ‘—not in another.’
“在某种程度上，”伯金回答道，“——在另一种方面则不然。”

There was a moment’s pause, after which Brangwen said:
停顿了一会儿，布兰文说道：

‘Well, she pleases herself—‘
“好吧，她取悦自己——”

‘Oh yes!’ said Birkin, calmly.
“哦，是的！”伯金平静地说。

A vibration came into Brangwen’s strong voice, as he replied:
布兰文的声音带着一丝颤抖，回答道：

‘Though I shouldn’t want her to be in too big a hurry, either. It’s no good looking round afterwards, when it’s too late.’
“不过我也不希望她太着急。事后再环顾四周是没有好处的，那时就为时已晚了。”

‘Oh, it need never be too late,’ said Birkin, ‘as far as that goes.’
“哦，就目前而言，永远不会太晚，”伯金说。

‘How do you mean?’ asked the father.
“你这是什么意思？”父亲问。

‘If one repents being married, the marriage is at an end,’ said Birkin.
伯金说：“如果一个人后悔结婚了，婚姻就结束了。”

‘You think so?’
“你这么认为吗？”

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

‘Ay, well that may be your way of looking at it.’
“嗯，这可能是你看待这件事的方式。”

Birkin, in silence, thought to himself: ‘So it may. As for YOUR way of looking at it, William Brangwen, it needs a little explaining.’
伯金默默地心想：“也许吧。”至于你看待它的方式，威廉·布兰文，需要稍微解释一下。

‘I suppose,’ said Brangwen, ‘you know what sort of people we are? What sort of a bringing-up she’s had?’
“我想，”布兰文说，“你知道我们是什么样的人吗？她是受过怎样的教育？

‘’She’,’ thought Birkin to himself, remembering his childhood’s corrections, ‘is the cat’s mother.’
“她”，伯金想起自己童年时的纠正，心里想，“是猫的妈妈。”

‘Do I know what sort of a bringing-up she’s had?’ he said aloud.
“我知道她是怎样长大的吗？”他大声说道。

He seemed to annoy Brangwen intentionally.
他似乎是故意惹恼布兰文。

‘Well,’ he said, ‘she’s had everything that’s right for a girl to have—as far as possible, as far as we could give it her.’
“好吧，”他说，“她已经拥有了一个女孩应该拥有的一切——尽可能地，尽可能地给她。”

‘I’m sure she has,’ said Birkin, which caused a perilous full-stop. The father was becoming exasperated. There was something naturally irritant to him in Birkin’s mere presence.
“我确信她做到了，”伯金说道，这引起了危险的句号。父亲变得越来越恼怒。只要伯金在场，他就会自然地感到恼火。

‘And I don’t want to see her going back on it all,’ he said, in a clanging voice.
“我不想看到她反悔，”他用铿锵的声音说道。

‘Why?’ said Birkin.
“为什么？”伯金说。

This monosyllable exploded in Brangwen’s brain like a shot.
这个单音节词像一声枪响一样在布兰文的大脑中爆炸。

‘Why! I don’t believe in your new-fangled ways and new-fangled ideas—in and out like a frog in a gallipot. It would never do for me.’
'为什么！我不相信你们新奇的方式和新奇的想法——就像青蛙在大锅里进出一样。这对我来说永远不会有用。

Birkin watched him with steady emotionless eyes. The radical antagnoism in the two men was rousing.
伯金用坚定、无感情的眼睛看着他。这两个人之间的激烈对抗令人振奋。

‘Yes, but are my ways and ideas new-fangled?’ asked Birkin.
“是的，但是我的方式和想法是新奇的吗？”伯金问道。

‘Are they?’ Brangwen caught himself up. ‘I’m not speaking of you in particular,’ he said. ‘What I mean is that my children have been brought up to think and do according to the religion I was brought up in myself, and I don’t want to see them going away from THAT.’
“是吗？”布兰文猛地回过神来。 “我不是特别说你，”他说。 “我的意思是，我的孩子们从小就按照我从小到大的宗教信仰来思考和做事，我不想看到他们背离这一点。”

There was a dangerous pause.
有一个危险的停顿。

‘And beyond that—?’ asked Birkin.
“除此之外——？”伯金问道。

The father hesitated, he was in a nasty position.
父亲犹豫了，他的处境很糟糕。

‘Eh? What do you mean? All I want to say is that my daughter’—he tailed off into silence, overcome by futility. He knew that in some way he was off the track.
‘呃？你是什​​么意思？我只想说，我的女儿——他陷入了沉默，陷入了徒劳的境地。他知道在某种程度上他已经偏离了轨道。

‘Of course,’ said Birkin, ‘I don’t want to hurt anybody or influence anybody. Ursula does exactly as she pleases.’
“当然，”伯金说，“我不想伤害任何人或影响任何人。乌苏拉完全按照她的意愿行事。

There was a complete silence, because of the utter failure in mutual understanding. Birkin felt bored. Her father was not a coherent human being, he was a roomful of old echoes. The eyes of the younger man rested on the face of the elder. Brangwen looked up, and saw Birkin looking at him. His face was covered with inarticulate anger and humiliation and sense of inferiority in strength.
由于完全无法相互理解，大家陷入了彻底的沉默。伯金感到无聊。她的父亲不是一个思路清晰的人，他满屋子都是旧的回声。年轻男子的目光落在了老者的脸上。布兰文抬起头，看到伯金正在看着他。他的脸上写满了说不出的愤怒和屈辱以及实力上的自卑感。

‘And as for beliefs, that’s one thing,’ he said. ‘But I’d rather see my daughters dead tomorrow than that they should be at the beck and call of the first man that likes to come and whistle for them.’
“至于信仰，这是一回事，”他说。 “但我宁愿看到我的女儿们明天死去，也不愿她们听从第一个愿意为她们吹口哨的男人的指挥。”

A queer painful light came into Birkin’s eyes.
伯金的眼中闪现出一种奇怪的、痛苦的光芒。

‘As to that,’ he said, ‘I only know that it’s much more likely that it’s I who am at the beck and call of the woman, than she at mine.’
“至于这一点，”他说，“我只知道，我更有可能听从那个女人的指挥，而不是她听从我的指挥。”

Again there was a pause. The father was somewhat bewildered.
又是一阵停顿。父亲有些茫然。

‘I know,’ he said, ‘she’ll please herself—she always has done. I’ve done my best for them, but that doesn’t matter. They’ve got themselves to please, and if they can help it they’ll please nobody BUT themselves. But she’s a right to consider her mother, and me as well—‘
“我知道，”他说，“她会取悦自己的——她一直都是这么做的。”我已经为他们尽力了，但这并不重要。他们必须取悦自己，如果他们能做到这一点，他们就会取悦任何人，除了他们自己。但她有权考虑她的母亲，还有我——”

Brangwen was thinking his own thoughts.
布兰文正在思考自己的想法。

‘And I tell you this much, I would rather bury them, than see them getting into a lot of loose ways such as you see everywhere nowadays. I’d rather bury them—‘
“我告诉你这么多，我宁愿埋葬他们，也不愿看到他们陷入像现在随处可见的许多松散的方式。我宁愿埋葬它们——”

‘Yes but, you see,’ said Birkin slowly, rather wearily, bored again by this new turn, ‘they won’t give either you or me the chance to bury them, because they’re not to be buried.’
“是的，但是，你看，”伯金慢慢地、相当疲惫地说道，对这个新的转折又感到厌倦了，“他们不会给你或我埋葬他们的机会，因为他们不会被埋葬。”

Brangwen looked at him in a sudden flare of impotent anger.
布兰文看着他，突然爆发出无力的愤怒。

‘Now, Mr Birkin,’ he said, ‘I don’t know what you’ve come here for, and I don’t know what you’re asking for. But my daughters are my daughters—and it’s my business to look after them while I can.’
“现在，伯金先生，”他说，“我不知道你来这里的目的是什么，我也不知道你要什么。但我的女儿就是我的女儿——我有责任尽我所能照顾她们。”

Birkin’s brows knitted suddenly, his eyes concentrated in mockery. But he remained perfectly stiff and still. There was a pause.
伯金的眉头突然皱起，眼神里充满了嘲讽。但他依然僵硬、一动不动。一阵停顿。

‘I’ve nothing against your marrying Ursula,’ Brangwen began at length. ‘It’s got nothing to do with me, she’ll do as she likes, me or no me.’
“我并不反对你嫁给乌苏拉，”布兰文最后说道。 “这与我无关，她爱怎么做就怎么做，有我也好，没有我也好。”

Birkin turned away, looking out of the window and letting go his consciousness. After all, what good was this? It was hopeless to keep it up. He would sit on till Ursula came home, then speak to her, then go away. He would not accept trouble at the hands of her father. It was all unnecessary, and he himself need not have provoked it.
伯金转过身，看着窗外，释放了意识。毕竟，这有什么好处呢？坚持下去是没有希望的。他会一直坐着，直到乌苏拉回家，然后和她说话，然后离开。他不会接受她父亲的麻烦。这一切都是不必要的，也不必是他自己挑起的。

The two men sat in complete silence, Birkin almost unconscious of his own whereabouts. He had come to ask her to marry him—well then, he would wait on, and ask her. As for what she said, whether she accepted or not, he did not think about it. He would say what he had come to say, and that was all he was conscious of. He accepted the complete insignificance of this household, for him. But everything now was as if fated. He could see one thing ahead, and no more. From the rest, he was absolved entirely for the time being. It had to be left to fate and chance to resolve the issues.
两个人一言不发地坐着，伯金几乎不知道自己在哪里。他是来向她求婚的——那么，他就等着，向她求婚吧。至于她说的话，接不接受，他都没有想。他会说出他想说的话，而这就是他所意识到的。他接受了这个家庭对于他而言完全微不足道的事实。但现在的一切都仿佛是命中注定。他只能看到前方的一件事，但仅此而已。暂时，他已经完全摆脱了其余的束缚。问题只能交给命运和机会来解决。

At length they heard the gate. They saw her coming up the steps with a bundle of books under her arm. Her face was bright and abstracted as usual, with the abstraction, that look of being not quite THERE, not quite present to the facts of reality, that galled her father so much. She had a maddening faculty of assuming a light of her own, which excluded the reality, and within which she looked radiant as if in sunshine.
终于，他们听到了大门的声音。他们看见她腋下夹着一包书走上台阶。她的脸像往常一样明亮而心不在焉，那种心不在焉的神情让她的父亲感到非常恼火。她有一种令人发狂的能力，能够呈现出自己的光芒，排除了现实，而在这种光芒中，她看起来就像在阳光下一样容光焕发。

They heard her go into the dining-room, and drop her armful of books on the table.
他们听到她走进餐厅，把抱着的书放在桌子上。

‘Did you bring me that Girl’s Own?’ cried Rosalind.
“你给我带来了那个女孩的礼物吗？”罗莎琳德喊道。

‘Yes, I brought it. But I forgot which one it was you wanted.’
‘是的，我带来了。但我忘记了你想要哪一件。”

‘You would,’ cried Rosalind angrily. ‘It’s right for a wonder.’
“你会的，”罗莎琳德愤怒地喊道。 “这真是一个奇迹。”

Then they heard her say something in a lowered tone.
然后他们听到她低声说了些什么。

‘Where?’ cried Ursula.
“去哪儿？”乌苏拉喊道。

Again her sister’s voice was muffled.
姐姐的声音又低沉了。

Brangwen opened the door, and called, in his strong, brazen voice:
布兰文打开门，用他那强有力、厚颜无耻的声音喊道：

‘Ursula.’
“乌苏拉。”

She appeared in a moment, wearing her hat.
一会儿她就出现了，戴着帽子。

‘Oh how do you do!’ she cried, seeing Birkin, and all dazzled as if taken by surprise. He wondered at her, knowing she was aware of his presence. She had her queer, radiant, breathless manner, as if confused by the actual world, unreal to it, having a complete bright world of her self alone.
“哦，你好！”她看到伯金包时大喊道，整个人都眼花缭乱，仿佛吃了一惊。他惊讶地看着她，知道她知道他的存在。她的举止古怪、容光焕发、气喘吁吁，仿佛被现实世界迷惑了，不真实，有一个完全属于她自己的明亮世界。

‘Have I interrupted a conversation?’ she asked.
“我打断了谈话吗？”她问道。

‘No, only a complete silence,’ said Birkin.
“不，只有完全的沉默，”伯金说。

‘Oh,’ said Ursula, vaguely, absent. Their presence was not vital to her, she was withheld, she did not take them in. It was a subtle insult that never failed to exasperate her father.
“哦，”乌苏拉含糊地说，心不在焉。他们的存在对她来说并不重要，她被拒绝了，她没有接受他们。这是一种微妙的侮辱，总是激怒她的父亲。

‘Mr Birkin came to speak to YOU, not to me,’ said her father.
“伯金先生是来和你说话的，不是和我说话，”她的父亲说。

‘Oh, did he!’ she exclaimed vaguely, as if it did not concern her. Then, recollecting herself, she turned to him rather radiantly, but still quite superficially, and said: ‘Was it anything special?’
“哦，是吗！”她含糊地喊道，好像这与她无关。然后，她回过神来，满面笑容地转向他，但仍然很肤浅地说：“有什么特别的吗？”

‘I hope so,’ he said, ironically.
“我希望如此，”他讽刺地说。

‘—To propose to you, according to all accounts,’ said her father.
“——据各方面报道，是向你求婚，”她父亲说。

‘Oh,’ said Ursula.
“哦，”乌苏拉说。

‘Oh,’ mocked her father, imitating her. ‘Have you nothing more to say?’
“哦，”她父亲模仿她的样子嘲笑道。 “你还有什么要说的吗？”

She winced as if violated.
她皱起眉头，仿佛受到了侵犯。

‘Did you really come to propose to me?’ she asked of Birkin, as if it were a joke.
“你真的是来向我求婚的吗？”她问伯金，仿佛这是一个笑话。

‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I suppose I came to propose.’ He seemed to fight shy of the last word.
“是的，”他说。 “我想我是来求婚的。”他似乎不愿说出最后一句话。

‘Did you?’ she cried, with her vague radiance. He might have been saying anything whatsoever. She seemed pleased.
“是吗？”她喊道，脸上带着模糊的光芒。他可能已经说了任何话。她看起来很高兴。

‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘I wanted to—I wanted you to agree to marry me.’
“是的，”他回答道。 “我想要——我想要你同意嫁给我。”

She looked at him. His eyes were flickering with mixed lights, wanting something of her, yet not wanting it. She shrank a little, as if she were exposed to his eyes, and as if it were a pain to her. She darkened, her soul clouded over, she turned aside. She had been driven out of her own radiant, single world. And she dreaded contact, it was almost unnatural to her at these times.
她看着他。他的眼眸闪烁着复杂的光芒，想要从她身上得到什么，却又不想要。她身子微微一缩，仿佛暴露在他的目光之中，又仿佛让她感到疼痛。她脸色阴沉，灵魂阴云密布，她转过身去。她被赶出了自己光辉灿烂的单一世界。她害怕接触，这对她来说几乎是不自然的。

‘Yes,’ she said vaguely, in a doubting, absent voice.
“是的，”她含糊地说，语气带着怀疑、心不在焉。

Birkin’s heart contracted swiftly, in a sudden fire of bitterness. It all meant nothing to her. He had been mistaken again. She was in some self-satisfied world of her own. He and his hopes were accidentals, violations to her. It drove her father to a pitch of mad exasperation. He had had to put up with this all his life, from her.
伯金的心迅速收缩，突然燃起一股苦涩之火。这一切对她来说毫无意义。他又错了。她沉浸在自己的某个自我满足的世界里。他和他的希望对她来说都是偶然的、侵犯的。这让她的父亲非常愤怒。他一生都必须忍受她的这一切。

‘Well, what do you say?’ he cried.
“好吧，你说什么？”他喊道。

She winced. Then she glanced down at her father, half-frightened, and she said:
她皱起了眉头。然后她低头看了一眼她的父亲，半是害怕，她说：

‘I didn’t speak, did I?’ as if she were afraid she might have committed herself.
“我没有说话，是吗？”好像她担心自己会做出承诺。

‘No,’ said her father, exasperated. ‘But you needn’t look like an idiot. You’ve got your wits, haven’t you?’
“不，”她父亲恼怒地说。 “但你不必看起来像个白痴。你有你的智慧，不是吗？

She ebbed away in silent hostility.
她在无声的敌意中逐渐消失。

‘I’ve got my wits, what does that mean?’ she repeated, in a sullen voice of antagonism.
“我有我的智慧，这是什么意思？”她重复道，语气阴沉，充满敌意。

‘You heard what was asked you, didn’t you?’ cried her father in anger.
“你听到了别人问你的话，不是吗？”她父亲愤怒地喊道。

‘Of course I heard.’
“我当然听到了。”

‘Well then, can’t you answer?’ thundered her father.
“那么，你就不能回答吗？”她父亲怒吼道。

‘Why should I?’
'我为什么要？'

At the impertinence of this retort, he went stiff. But he said nothing.
听到这无礼的反驳，他整个人都僵住了。但他什么也没说。

‘No,’ said Birkin, to help out the occasion, ‘there’s no need to answer at once. You can say when you like.’
“不，”伯金为了应付这个场合说道，“没有必要立刻回答。”你什么时候愿意就可以说。

Her eyes flashed with a powerful light.
她的双眸闪烁着强大的光芒。

‘Why should I say anything?’ she cried. ‘You do this off your OWN bat, it has nothing to do with me. Why do you both want to bully me?’
“我为什么要说什么？”她喊道。 “这是你自己做的，与我无关。为什么你们两个都想欺负我？

‘Bully you! Bully you!’ cried her father, in bitter, rancorous anger. ‘Bully you! Why, it’s a pity you can’t be bullied into some sense and decency. Bully you! YOU’LL see to that, you self-willed creature.’
‘欺负你！欺负你！”她父亲愤怒地喊道。 ‘欺负你！唉，可惜你不能被欺负得有理智、有尊严。欺负你！你会看到这一点的，你这个任性的生物。

She stood suspended in the middle of the room, her face glimmering and dangerous. She was set in satisfied defiance. Birkin looked up at her. He too was angry.
她悬浮在房间中央，脸上闪烁着危险的光芒。她心满意足地反抗着。伯金抬头看着她。他也很生气。

‘But none is bullying you,’ he said, in a very soft dangerous voice also.
“但没有人欺负你，”他说，声音也非常轻柔，危险。

‘Oh yes,’ she cried. ‘You both want to force me into something.’
“哦，是的，”她喊道。 “你们俩都想强迫我做某事。”

‘That is an illusion of yours,’ he said ironically.
“那是你的幻觉。”他讽刺地说。

‘Illusion!’ cried her father. ‘A self-opinionated fool, that’s what she is.’
“幻觉！”她父亲叫道。 “她就是一个自以为是的傻瓜。”

Birkin rose, saying:
柏金玫瑰，说道：

‘However, we’ll leave it for the time being.’
“不过，我们暂时先不管它。”

And without another word, he walked out of the house.
说完，他没有再多说什么，就走出了屋子。

‘You fool! You fool!’ her father cried to her, with extreme bitterness. She left the room, and went upstairs, singing to herself. But she was terribly fluttered, as after some dreadful fight. From her window, she could see Birkin going up the road. He went in such a blithe drift of rage, that her mind wondered over him. He was ridiculous, but she was afraid of him. She was as if escaped from some danger.
'你个笨蛋！你这个傻瓜！”她父亲极其痛苦地对她喊道。她离开房间，上楼，自言自语。但她心慌意乱，就像经历了一场可怕的战斗一样。从窗户里，她可以看到伯金正在路上行驶。他的心情如此愉快、愤怒，以至于她的思绪都在想着他。他很可笑，但她却害怕他。她就像是逃离了某种危险。

Her father sat below, powerless in humiliation and chagrin. It was as if he were possessed with all the devils, after one of these unaccountable conflicts with Ursula. He hated her as if his only reality were in hating her to the last degree. He had all hell in his heart. But he went away, to escape himself. He knew he must despair, yield, give in to despair, and have done.
她的父亲坐在下面，因羞辱和懊恼而无能为力。在与乌苏拉发生了一场莫名其妙的冲突之后，他仿佛被所有的魔鬼附身了。他恨她，仿佛他唯一的现实就是恨她到极点。他的心里充满了地狱。但他却离开了，是为了逃避自己。他知道他必须绝望、屈服、向绝望屈服，然后就这么做了。

Ursula’s face closed, she completed herself against them all. Recoiling upon herself, she became hard and self-completed, like a jewel. She was bright and invulnerable, quite free and happy, perfectly liberated in her self-possession. Her father had to learn not to see her blithe obliviousness, or it would have sent him mad. She was so radiant with all things, in her possession of perfect hostility.
乌苏拉闭着脸，面对所有人，她完成了自己。她退缩了，变得坚强而自我完善，就像一颗宝石。她很聪明，无懈可击，非常自由和快乐，完全解放了她的自制力。她的父亲必须学会不要看到她无忧无虑的健忘，否则他会发疯的。她对一切都是如此容光焕发，充满了十足的敌意。

She would go on now for days like this, in this bright frank state of seemingly pure spontaneity, so essentially oblivious of the existence of anything but herself, but so ready and facile in her interest. Ah it was a bitter thing for a man to be near her, and her father cursed his fatherhood. But he must learn not to see her, not to know.
她会继续这样的日子，在这种看似纯粹自发的明亮坦率的状态中，基本上忘记了除了她自己之外的任何东西的存在，但她准备好并轻松地感兴趣。啊，一个男人靠近她真是一件痛苦的事情，她的父亲诅咒了他的父亲身份。但他必须学会不去见她，不去了解她。

She was perfectly stable in resistance when she was in this state: so bright and radiant and attractive in her pure opposition, so very pure, and yet mistrusted by everybody, disliked on every hand. It was her voice, curiously clear and repellent, that gave her away. Only Gudrun was in accord with her. It was at these times that the intimacy between the two sisters was most complete, as if their intelligence were one. They felt a strong, bright bond of understanding between them, surpassing everything else. And during all these days of blind bright abstraction and intimacy of his two daughters, the father seemed to breathe an air of death, as if he were destroyed in his very being. He was irritable to madness, he could not rest, his daughters seemed to be destroying him. But he was inarticulate and helpless against them. He was forced to breathe the air of his own death. He cursed them in his soul, and only wanted, that they should be removed from him.
当她处于这种状态时，她的反抗是完全稳定的：在她纯粹的反对中是如此明亮、容光焕发和有吸引力，如此非常纯洁，但却被每个人不信任，各方面都不喜欢。她的声音出奇地清晰，令人厌恶，暴露了她的身份。只有古德伦同意她的看法。正是在这个时候，两姐妹之间的亲密感最为彻底，仿佛她们的智力合而为一。他们感到彼此之间有一种强烈而明亮的理解纽带，超越了其他一切。在他的两个女儿盲目而明亮的抽象和亲密的这些天里，父亲似乎呼吸着死亡的空气，仿佛他的存在被摧毁了。他烦躁得发疯，无法休息，他的女儿们似乎正在毁掉他。但他对他们却口齿不清、无能为力。他被迫呼吸着自己死亡的空气。他在灵魂中诅咒他们，只想将他们从他身边除掉。

They continued radiant in their easy female transcendancy, beautiful to look at. They exchanged confidences, they were intimate in their revelations to the last degree, giving each other at last every secret. They withheld nothing, they told everything, till they were over the border of evil. And they armed each other with knowledge, they extracted the subtlest flavours from the apple of knowledge. It was curious how their knowledge was complementary, that of each to that of the other.
她们继续散发着轻松的女性超越光芒，看起来很美丽。他们交换了秘密，他们在吐露心事时极其亲密，最后互相透露了每一个秘密。他们什么也不隐瞒，他们把一切都说出来，直到他们越过了邪恶的边界。他们用知识武装彼此，从知识的苹果中提取最微妙的味道。令人好奇的是，他们的知识如何相互补充。

Ursula saw her men as sons, pitied their yearning and admired their courage, and wondered over them as a mother wonders over her child, with a certain delight in their novelty. But to Gudrun, they were the opposite camp. She feared them and despised them, and respected their activities even overmuch.
乌苏拉将她的男人视为儿子，同情他们的渴望并钦佩他们的勇气，并像母亲好奇她的孩子一样好奇他们，对他们的新奇感到一定的高兴。但对于古珍来说，他们却是相反的阵营。她害怕他们，鄙视他们，对他们的行为更是过分尊重。

‘Of course,’ she said easily, ‘there is a quality of life in Birkin which is quite remarkable. There is an extraordinary rich spring of life in him, really amazing, the way he can give himself to things. But there are so many things in life that he simply doesn’t know. Either he is not aware of their existence at all, or he dismisses them as merely negligible—things which are vital to the other person. In a way, he is not clever enough, he is too intense in spots.’
“当然，”她轻松地说，“伯金的生活质量非常出色。他身上有一种非同寻常的丰富的生命之泉，他能够把自己奉献给事物，这真是令人惊奇。但生活中有很多事情他根本不知道。要么他根本不知道它们的存在，要么他认为它们只是微不足道的——对他人来说至关重要的事情。从某种程度上来说，他不够聪明，他在某些方面过于紧张。”

‘Yes,’ cried Ursula, ‘too much of a preacher. He is really a priest.’
“是的，”乌苏拉喊道，“太像个传教士了。”他真的是一位牧师。

‘Exactly! He can’t hear what anybody else has to say—he simply cannot hear. His own voice is so loud.’
'确切地！他听不到别人在说什么——他根本听不到。他自己的声音太大了。

‘Yes. He cries you down.’
'是的。他让你哭了。

‘He cries you down,’ repeated Gudrun. ‘And by mere force of violence. And of course it is hopeless. Nobody is convinced by violence. It makes talking to him impossible—and living with him I should think would be more than impossible.’
“他让你哭了，”古德伦重复道。 '并且仅仅通过暴力。当然，这是没有希望的。没有人相信暴力。这使得与他交谈变得不可能——我想和他一起生活更是不可能的。

‘You don’t think one could live with him’ asked Ursula.
“你认为没人能和他住在一起”乌苏拉问道。

‘I think it would be too wearing, too exhausting. One would be shouted down every time, and rushed into his way without any choice. He would want to control you entirely. He cannot allow that there is any other mind than his own. And then the real clumsiness of his mind is its lack of self-criticism. No, I think it would be perfectly intolerable.’
“我认为这太累了，太累了。每次都会被喊倒，然后无可奈何地冲上前去。他会想完全控制你。他不能允许除了他自己的思想之外还有任何其他的思想。他的思想真正的笨拙在于缺乏自我批评。不，我认为这是完全无法容忍的。

‘Yes,’ assented Ursula vaguely. She only half agreed with Gudrun. ‘The nuisance is,’ she said, ‘that one would find almost any man intolerable after a fortnight.’
“是的，”乌苏拉含糊地表示同意。她只同意古德伦的一半观点。 “令人讨厌的是，”她说，“两周后，人们会发现几乎任何男人都无法忍受。”

‘It’s perfectly dreadful,’ said Gudrun. ‘But Birkin—he is too positive. He couldn’t bear it if you called your soul your own. Of him that is strictly true.’
“这太可怕了，”古德伦说。 “但是伯金——他太积极了。如果你称自己的灵魂为自己的灵魂，他将无法忍受。对他来说，这是完全正确的。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula. ‘You must have HIS soul.’
“是的，”乌苏拉说。 “你必须拥有他的灵魂。”

‘Exactly! And what can you conceive more deadly?’ This was all so true, that Ursula felt jarred to the bottom of her soul with ugly distaste.
'确切地！还有什么比这更致命的呢？”这一切都是如此真实，乌苏拉感到灵魂深处的震动，充满了丑恶的厌恶。

She went on, with the discord jarring and jolting through her, in the most barren of misery.
她继续前行，不和谐的声音在她身上刺痛、震动，在最贫瘠的痛苦中。

Then there started a revulsion from Gudrun. She finished life off so thoroughly, she made things so ugly and so final. As a matter of fact, even if it were as Gudrun said, about Birkin, other things were true as well. But Gudrun would draw two lines under him and cross him out like an account that is settled. There he was, summed up, paid for, settled, done with. And it was such a lie. This finality of Gudrun’s, this dispatching of people and things in a sentence, it was all such a lie. Ursula began to revolt from her sister.
然后古德伦开始感到厌恶。她如此彻底地结束了生命，她让事情变得如此丑陋，如此最终。事实上，即使像古德伦所说的那样，关于Birkin，其他的事情也是如此。但古德伦会在他下面画两条线，然后把他划掉，就像一笔已算清的账一样。他就在那里，总结、付钱、安顿下来、结束了。这真是一个谎言。古珍的这种结局，一句话中的人和事的调度，这一切都是谎言。乌苏拉开始反抗她的姐姐。

One day as they were walking along the lane, they saw a robin sitting on the top twig of a bush, singing shrilly. The sisters stood to look at him. An ironical smile flickered on Gudrun’s face.
有一天，他们沿着小巷散步，看见一只知更鸟坐在灌木丛的顶端，尖声歌唱。姐妹们站起来看着他。古德伦的脸上闪过一丝讽刺的笑容。

‘Doesn’t he feel important?’ smiled Gudrun.
“他不觉得自己很重要吗？”古珍微笑道。

‘Doesn’t he!’ exclaimed Ursula, with a little ironical grimace. ‘Isn’t he a little Lloyd George of the air!’
“不是吗！”乌苏拉大声说道，脸上带着一丝讽刺的表情。 “他是不是有点空中劳合·乔治！”

‘Isn’t he! Little Lloyd George of the air! That’s just what they are,’ cried Gudrun in delight. Then for days, Ursula saw the persistent, obtrusive birds as stout, short politicians lifting up their voices from the platform, little men who must make themselves heard at any cost.
‘不是吗！空中的小劳埃德·乔治！就是这样，”古德伦高兴地喊道。接下来的几天里，乌苏拉把这些坚持不懈、引人注目的鸟儿看作是在讲台上高调发声的矮胖政客，是必须不惜一切代价让自己的声音被听到的小人物。

But even from this there came the revulsion. Some yellowhammers suddenly shot along the road in front of her. And they looked to her so uncanny and inhuman, like flaring yellow barbs shooting through the air on some weird, living errand, that she said to herself: ‘After all, it is impudence to call them little Lloyd Georges. They are really unknown to us, they are the unknown forces. It is impudence to look at them as if they were the same as human beings. They are of another world. How stupid anthropomorphism is! Gudrun is really impudent, insolent, making herself the measure of everything, making everything come down to human standards. Rupert is quite right, human beings are boring, painting the universe with their own image. The universe is non-human, thank God.’ It seemed to her irreverence, destructive of all true life, to make little Lloyd Georges of the birds. It was such a lie towards the robins, and such a defamation. Yet she had done it herself. But under Gudrun’s influence: so she exonerated herself.
但即便如此，反感也随之而来。一些黄锤突然沿着她前面的道路射击。在她看来，它们是如此的不可思议和不人道，就像在执行一些奇怪的、活生生的差事时在空中射出的黄色倒刺，以至于她对自己说：“毕竟，称它们为小劳合·乔治是无礼的。”他们对我们来说确实是未知的，他们是未知的力量。把他们当作人类一样看待是无礼的。他们是另一个世界的人。拟人化是多么愚蠢啊！古珍真是无礼、无礼，以自己为衡量一切的标准，以人类的标准来衡量一切。鲁珀特说得很对，人类很无聊，用自己的形象来描绘宇宙。感谢上帝，这个宇宙是非人类的。”在她看来，把小劳埃德·乔治变成鸟儿似乎是一种不敬，破坏了所有真正的生活。这是对知更鸟的谎言，也是诽谤。然而她自己却做到了。但在古德伦的影响下：所以她为自己开脱了。

So she withdrew away from Gudrun and from that which she stood for, she turned in spirit towards Birkin again. She had not seen him since the fiasco of his proposal. She did not want to, because she did not want the question of her acceptance thrust upon her. She knew what Birkin meant when he asked her to marry him; vaguely, without putting it into speech, she knew. She knew what kind of love, what kind of surrender he wanted. And she was not at all sure that this was the kind of love that she herself wanted. She was not at all sure that it was this mutual unison in separateness that she wanted. She wanted unspeakable intimacies. She wanted to have him, utterly, finally to have him as her own, oh, so unspeakably, in intimacy. To drink him down—ah, like a life-draught. She made great professions, to herself, of her willingness to warm his foot-soles between her breasts, after the fashion of the nauseous Meredith poem. But only on condition that he, her lover, loved her absolutely, with complete self-abandon. And subtly enough, she knew he would never abandon himself FINALLY to her. He did not believe in final self-abandonment. He said it openly. It was his challenge. She was prepared to fight him for it. For she believed in an absolute surrender to love. She believed that love far surpassed the individual. He said the individual was MORE than love, or than any relationship. For him, the bright, single soul accepted love as one of its conditions, a condition of its own equilibrium. She believed that love was EVERYTHING. Man must render himself up to her. He must be quaffed to the dregs by her. Let him be HER MAN utterly, and she in return would be his humble slave—whether she wanted it or not.
于是她离开了古德伦，离开了她所代表的一切，她的精神再次转向了柏金。自从他求婚失败后，她就没有见过他了。她不想，因为她不想让自己接受这个问题。当伯金向她求婚时，她知道他的意思。她隐隐约约地知道，虽然没有用言语表达出来。她知道他想要什么样的爱，什么样的臣服。而她也完全不确定这就是她自己想要的那种爱情。她完全不确定自己想要的就是这种分离中的统一。她想要难以言喻的亲密。她想要拥有他，彻底地，最终拥有他，哦，如此难以言表的亲密。让他喝下去——啊，就像生命药水一样。她向自己表白，她愿意按照令人作呕的梅雷迪思诗的风格，用自己的乳房温暖他的脚底。但前提是他，她的爱人，绝对地爱她，完全的自我放弃。微妙的是，她知道他永远不会最终放弃自己。他不相信最终的自我放弃。他公开地说了这句话。这是他的挑战。她已经做好了与他决斗的准备。因为她相信对爱的绝对臣服。她相信爱远远超越个人。他说个人不仅仅是爱情，也不仅仅是任何关系。对他来说，明亮而单一的灵魂接受爱作为其条件之一，作为其自身平衡的条件。她相信爱就是一切。男人必须向她屈服。他一定是被她喝得一干二净了。让他完全成为她的男人，作为回报，她将成为他卑微的奴隶——无论她愿意与否。

CHAPTER XX.
第二十章。

GLADIATORIAL
角斗士

After the fiasco of the proposal, Birkin had hurried blindly away from Beldover, in a whirl of fury. He felt he had been a complete fool, that the whole scene had been a farce of the first water. But that did not trouble him at all. He was deeply, mockingly angry that Ursula persisted always in this old cry: ‘Why do you want to bully me?’ and in her bright, insolent abstraction.
求婚惨败后，伯金一怒之下盲目地离开了贝尔多弗。他觉得自己简直就是个傻瓜，整个场面简直就是一场闹剧。但这根本没有困扰他。他对乌苏拉总是老喊着“你为什么想欺负我？”以及她那明亮、傲慢的抽象感到深深的、嘲讽的愤怒。

He went straight to Shortlands. There he found Gerald standing with his back to the fire, in the library, as motionless as a man is, who is completely and emptily restless, utterly hollow. He had done all the work he wanted to do—and now there was nothing. He could go out in the car, he could run to town. But he did not want to go out in the car, he did not want to run to town, he did not want to call on the Thirlbys. He was suspended motionless, in an agony of inertia, like a machine that is without power.
他径直前往肖特兰兹。他发现杰拉尔德背对着火站在图书馆里，一动不动，就像一个人一样，完全空虚不安，完全空虚。他已经完成了所有他想做的工作——但现在什么也没有了。他可以开车出去，也可以跑进城。但他不想开车出去，他不想跑进城，他不想拜访瑟尔比一家。他一动不动地悬在空中，陷入惯性的痛苦之中，就像一台没有动力的机器。

This was very bitter to Gerald, who had never known what boredom was, who had gone from activity to activity, never at a loss. Now, gradually, everything seemed to be stopping in him. He did not want any more to do the things that offered. Something dead within him just refused to respond to any suggestion. He cast over in his mind, what it would be possible to do, to save himself from this misery of nothingness, relieve the stress of this hollowness. And there were only three things left, that would rouse him, make him live. One was to drink or smoke hashish, the other was to be soothed by Birkin, and the third was women. And there was no-one for the moment to drink with. Nor was there a woman. And he knew Birkin was out. So there was nothing to do but to bear the stress of his own emptiness.
这对杰拉尔德来说非常痛苦，他从来不知道无聊是什么，他从一个活动到另一个活动，从来没有迷失过。现在，渐渐地，一切似乎都在他身上停止了。他不想再做那些提供的事情了。他内心深处有某种死气沉沉的东西拒绝回应任何建议。他心里盘算着，能做些什么，才能把自己从这种虚无的痛苦中拯救出来，缓解这种空虚的压力。现在只剩下三件事可以唤醒他，让他活下去。一是喝酒或抽大麻，二是用柏金包安抚，三是女人。而且暂时没有人可以一起喝酒。也没有女人。他知道柏金包已经过时了。所以除了承受自己空虚的压力之外，别无他法。

When he saw Birkin his face lit up in a sudden, wonderful smile.
当他看到 Birkin 时，脸上突然绽放出灿烂的笑容。

‘By God, Rupert,’ he said, ‘I’d just come to the conclusion that nothing in the world mattered except somebody to take the edge off one’s being alone: the right somebody.’
“天哪，鲁珀特，”他说，“我刚刚得出的结论是，世界上没有什么比一个人能减轻孤独的压力更重要的了：一个合适的人。”

The smile in his eyes was very astonishing, as he looked at the other man. It was the pure gleam of relief. His face was pallid and even haggard.
他看着对方，眼中的笑意十分惊人。那是纯粹的如释重负的光芒。他的脸色苍白，甚至有些憔悴。

‘The right woman, I suppose you mean,’ said Birkin spitefully.
“我想你是说合适的女人，”伯金恶毒地说。

‘Of course, for choice. Failing that, an amusing man.’
‘当然，可以选择。如果做不到这一点，他就是一个有趣的人。

He laughed as he said it. Birkin sat down near the fire.
他一边说一边笑起来。伯金在火边坐下。

‘What were you doing?’ he asked.
“你在做什么？”他问。

‘I? Nothing. I’m in a bad way just now, everything’s on edge, and I can neither work nor play. I don’t know whether it’s a sign of old age, I’m sure.’
'我？没有什么。我现在的状态很不好，一切都紧张，既不能工作，也不能玩耍。我确定，我不知道这是否是衰老的迹象。

‘You mean you are bored?’
“你是说你很无聊？”

‘Bored, I don’t know. I can’t apply myself. And I feel the devil is either very present inside me, or dead.’
‘无聊，我不知道。我自己无法申请。我觉得魔鬼要么就在我体内，要么已经死了。”

Birkin glanced up and looked in his eyes.
伯金抬起头，看着他的眼睛。

‘You should try hitting something,’ he said.
“你应该尝试击打一些东西，”他说。

Gerald smiled.
杰拉德笑了。

‘Perhaps,’ he said. ‘So long as it was something worth hitting.’
“也许吧，”他说。 “只要是值得打的东西就行。”

‘Quite!’ said Birkin, in his soft voice. There was a long pause during which each could feel the presence of the other.
“完全可以！”伯金用柔和的声音说道。有一个很长的停顿，在此期间，每个人都能感觉到对方的存在。

‘One has to wait,’ said Birkin.
“人们必须等待，”伯金说。

‘Ah God! Waiting! What are we waiting for?’
‘啊上帝！等待！我们还在等什么？'

‘Some old Johnny says there are three cures for ENNUI, sleep, drink, and travel,’ said Birkin.
“一些老约翰尼说缓解倦怠的方法有三种：睡眠、饮酒和旅行，”伯金说。

‘All cold eggs,’ said Gerald. ‘In sleep, you dream, in drink you curse, and in travel you yell at a porter. No, work and love are the two. When you’re not at work you should be in love.’
“都是冷鸡蛋，”杰拉尔德说。 “睡觉时你会做梦，喝酒时你会咒骂，旅行时你会对搬运工大喊大叫。不，工作和爱情是两个。当你不工作的时候，你应该恋爱。”

‘Be it then,’ said Birkin.
“那就这样吧，”伯金说。

‘Give me the object,’ said Gerald. ‘The possibilities of love exhaust themselves.’
“把那个东西给我，”杰拉尔德说。 “爱的可能性耗尽了。”

‘Do they? And then what?’
‘是吗？然后什么？'

‘Then you die,’ said Gerald.
“然后你就死了，”杰拉德说。

‘So you ought,’ said Birkin.
“所以你应该这样做，”伯金说。

‘I don’t see it,’ replied Gerald. He took his hands out of his trousers pockets, and reached for a cigarette. He was tense and nervous. He lit the cigarette over a lamp, reaching forward and drawing steadily. He was dressed for dinner, as usual in the evening, although he was alone.
“我没有看到，”杰拉德回答道。他把手从裤兜里拿出来，伸手去拿一支烟。他很紧张，很紧张。他在灯上点燃香烟，向前伸手，稳稳地抽着。尽管只有他一个人，但他还是像往常一样穿好了去吃晚饭的衣服。

‘There’s a third one even to your two,’ said Birkin. ‘Work, love, and fighting. You forget the fight.’
“即使是你的两个，还有第三个，”伯金说。 “工作、爱情和战斗。你忘记了战斗。

‘I suppose I do,’ said Gerald. ‘Did you ever do any boxing—?’
“我想是的，”杰拉尔德说。 “你打过拳击吗——？”

‘No, I don’t think I did,’ said Birkin.
“不，我想我没有这么做，”伯金说。

‘Ay—‘ Gerald lifted his head and blew the smoke slowly into the air.
“哎——”杰拉德抬起头，慢慢地将烟雾吹向空中。

‘Why?’ said Birkin.
“为什么？”伯金说。

‘Nothing. I thought we might have a round. It is perhaps true, that I want something to hit. It’s a suggestion.’
'没有什么。我想我们可以打一轮。也许确实如此，我想要击中一些东西。这是一个建议。

‘So you think you might as well hit me?’ said Birkin.
“所以你认为你最好打我吗？”伯金说。

‘You? Well! Perhaps—! In a friendly kind of way, of course.’
'你？出色地！也许-！当然，以一种友好的方式。

‘Quite!’ said Birkin, bitingly.
“确实如此！”伯金尖刻地说。

Gerald stood leaning back against the mantel-piece. He looked down at Birkin, and his eyes flashed with a sort of terror like the eyes of a stallion, that are bloodshot and overwrought, turned glancing backwards in a stiff terror.
杰拉尔德站在那里，靠在壁炉架上。他低头看着伯金，他的眼睛里闪烁着一种恐惧，就像种马的眼睛一样，布满血丝，过度紧张，在僵硬的恐惧中向后看了一眼。

‘I fell that if I don’t watch myself, I shall find myself doing something silly,’ he said.
“我觉得如果我不注意自己，我会发现自己在做一些愚蠢的事情，”他说。

‘Why not do it?’ said Birkin coldly.
“为什么不这么做呢？”伯金冷冷地说。

Gerald listened with quick impatience. He kept glancing down at Birkin, as if looking for something from the other man.
杰拉德听得很快不耐烦。他一直低头看着伯金，仿佛在从对方身上寻找什么。

‘I used to do some Japanese wrestling,’ said Birkin. ‘A Jap lived in the same house with me in Heidelberg, and he taught me a little. But I was never much good at it.’
“我曾经参加过一些日本摔跤比赛，”伯金说。 “一个日本人和我在海德堡住在同一栋房子里，他教了我一些东西。但我从来都不擅长。

‘You did!’ exclaimed Gerald. ‘That’s one of the things I’ve never ever seen done. You mean jiu-jitsu, I suppose?’
“你做到了！”杰拉尔德喊道。 “这是我从未见过的事情之一。我想你是说柔术？

‘Yes. But I am no good at those things—they don’t interest me.’
'是的。但我不擅长这些事情——我对它们不感兴趣。”

‘They don’t? They do me. What’s the start?’
‘他们不这么认为吗？他们做我。什么是开始？

‘I’ll show you what I can, if you like,’ said Birkin.
“如果你愿意的话，我会告诉你我能做什么，”伯金说。

‘You will?’ A queer, smiling look tightened Gerald’s face for a moment, as he said, ‘Well, I’d like it very much.’
“你会吗？”杰拉尔德的脸上露出了一丝奇怪的微笑，他说道：“好吧，我非常想要。”

‘Then we’ll try jiu-jitsu. Only you can’t do much in a starched shirt.’
‘那我们就试试柔术。只是你穿着浆过的衬衫做不了多少事。”

‘Then let us strip, and do it properly. Hold a minute—‘ He rang the bell, and waited for the butler.
‘那么，让我们脱掉衣服，好好脱掉吧。等一下——”他按响了门铃，等待管家。

‘Bring a couple of sandwiches and a syphon,’ he said to the man, ‘and then don’t trouble me any more tonight—or let anybody else.’
“带上几个三明治和一个虹吸管来，”他对那人说，“然后今晚就别再麻烦我了——也别让其他人来麻烦我了。”

The man went. Gerald turned to Birkin with his eyes lighted.
那人走了。杰拉德转向伯金，眼睛闪闪发亮。

‘And you used to wrestle with a Jap?’ he said. ‘Did you strip?’
“你以前和一个日本人摔跤吗？”他说。 “你脱衣服了吗？”

‘Sometimes.’
'有时。'

‘You did! What was he like then, as a wrestler?’
‘你做到了！作为一名摔跤手，他当时是什么样子？

‘Good, I believe. I am no judge. He was very quick and slippery and full of electric fire. It is a remarkable thing, what a curious sort of fluid force they seem to have in them, those people not like a human grip—like a polyp—‘
‘很好，我相信。我不是法官。他动作敏捷，动作敏捷，浑身充满电火。这是一件了不起的事情，他们身上似乎有一种奇怪的流体力量，这些人不像人类的握力——就像息肉——”

Gerald nodded.
杰拉德点点头。

‘I should imagine so,’ he said, ‘to look at them. They repel me, rather.’
“我应该这样想，”他说，“看看它们。”相反，他们让我厌恶。

‘Repel and attract, both. They are very repulsive when they are cold, and they look grey. But when they are hot and roused, there is a definite attraction—a curious kind of full electric fluid—like eels.’
‘排斥和吸引，两者兼而有之。它们在寒冷的时候非常令人厌恶，而且看起来是灰色的。但当它们发热并被唤醒时，就会有一种明显的吸引力——一种奇怪的充满电流的液体——就像鳗鱼一样。

‘Well—yes—probably.’
“嗯——是的——可能吧。”

The man brought in the tray and set it down.
男人把托盘端了进来，放了下来。

‘Don’t come in any more,’ said Gerald.
“别再进来了，”杰拉尔德说。

The door closed.
门关上了。

‘Well then,’ said Gerald; ‘shall we strip and begin? Will you have a drink first?’
“那么，”杰拉尔德说。 ‘我们脱光衣服开始吧？你先喝一杯吗？

‘No, I don’t want one.’
“不，我不想要。”

‘Neither do I.’
'我也不。'

Gerald fastened the door and pushed the furniture aside. The room was large, there was plenty of space, it was thickly carpeted. Then he quickly threw off his clothes, and waited for Birkin. The latter, white and thin, came over to him. Birkin was more a presence than a visible object, Gerald was aware of him completely, but not really visually. Whereas Gerald himself was concrete and noticeable, a piece of pure final substance.
杰拉尔德关上门，把家具推到一边。房间很大，空间很大，铺着厚厚的地毯。然后他迅速脱掉衣服，等待伯金。后者，又白又瘦，向他走了过来。伯金与其说是一个可见的物体，不如说是一个存在，杰拉德完全意识到了他，但实际上并不是在视觉上。而杰拉德本人则具体而引人注目，是一块纯粹的最终实体。

‘Now,’ said Birkin, ‘I will show you what I learned, and what I remember. You let me take you so—‘ And his hands closed on the naked body of the other man. In another moment, he had Gerald swung over lightly and balanced against his knee, head downwards. Relaxed, Gerald sprang to his feet with eyes glittering.
“现在，”伯金说，“我将向你展示我学到了什么，以及我记得什么。”你让我这样带你——”他的双手放在另一个男人赤裸的身体上。又过了一会儿，他让杰拉德轻轻地转过身来，头朝下靠在他的膝盖上保持平衡。杰拉德放松下来，一跃而起，眼睛闪闪发亮。

‘That’s smart,’ he said. ‘Now try again.’
“这很聪明，”他说。 “现在再试一次。”

So the two men began to struggle together. They were very dissimilar. Birkin was tall and narrow, his bones were very thin and fine. Gerald was much heavier and more plastic. His bones were strong and round, his limbs were rounded, all his contours were beautifully and fully moulded. He seemed to stand with a proper, rich weight on the face of the earth, whilst Birkin seemed to have the centre of gravitation in his own middle. And Gerald had a rich, frictional kind of strength, rather mechanical, but sudden and invincible, whereas Birkin was abstract as to be almost intangible. He impinged invisibly upon the other man, scarcely seeming to touch him, like a garment, and then suddenly piercing in a tense fine grip that seemed to penetrate into the very quick of Gerald’s being.
于是两个人开始纠缠在一起。他们非常不同。柏金身材又高又窄，骨头又细又细。杰拉德更重，更具塑料感。他的骨骼强健圆润，四肢圆润，所有的轮廓都优美而完整。他似乎以一种适当的、丰富的重量站立在地球表面，而柏金的重心似乎就在他自己的中间。杰拉尔德有一种丰富的、摩擦性的力量，相当机械，但突然且不可战胜，而伯金则抽象得几乎是无形的。他无形地撞到了另一个人身上，几乎没有接触到他，就像一件衣服，然后突然用紧张的细握刺入，似乎刺入了杰拉尔德的身体的最深处。

They stopped, they discussed methods, they practised grips and throws, they became accustomed to each other, to each other’s rhythm, they got a kind of mutual physical understanding. And then again they had a real struggle. They seemed to drive their white flesh deeper and deeper against each other, as if they would break into a oneness. Birkin had a great subtle energy, that would press upon the other man with an uncanny force, weigh him like a spell put upon him. Then it would pass, and Gerald would heave free, with white, heaving, dazzling movements.
他们停下来，讨论方法，练习抓握和投掷，他们习惯了彼此，习惯了彼此的节奏，他们获得了一种身体上的相互理解。然后他们又进行了一场真正的斗争。他们似乎将白色的肉体彼此推得越来越深，仿佛要融为一体。伯金有一种巨大而微妙的能量，会以一种不可思议的力量压在另一个人身上，像施咒语一样压在他身上。然后一切都会过去，杰拉尔德会自由地起伏，动作是白色的、起伏的、令人眼花缭乱的。

So the two men entwined and wrestled with each other, working nearer and nearer. Both were white and clear, but Gerald flushed smart red where he was touched, and Birkin remained white and tense. He seemed to penetrate into Gerald’s more solid, more diffuse bulk, to interfuse his body through the body of the other, as if to bring it subtly into subjection, always seizing with some rapid necromantic fore-knowledge every motion of the other flesh, converting and counteracting it, playing upon the limbs and trunk of Gerald like some hard wind. It was as if Birkin’s whole physical intelligence interpenetrated into Gerald’s body, as if his fine, sublimated energy entered into the flesh of the fuller man, like some potency, casting a fine net, a prison, through the muscles into the very depths of Gerald’s physical being.
于是，两个人纠缠在一起，扭打在一起，越走越近。两人都是白皙透明的，但杰拉尔德被碰触的地方涨得通红，而伯金则依然苍白而紧张。他似乎渗透进了杰拉德更坚实、更分散的身体，将自己的身体融入到对方的身体中，仿佛要巧妙地让对方屈服，总是以某种快速的死灵预知力抓住对方肉体的每一个动作，将对方的身体转化为力量。并抵消它，像一阵强风一样吹拂着杰拉尔德的四肢和躯干。就好像伯金的整个身体智慧渗透到了杰拉德的身体里，仿佛他精妙的、升华的能量进入了更充实的人的肉体，就像某种力量，投下一张细密的网，一座监狱，穿过肌肉进入杰拉德的最深处。物理存在。

So they wrestled swiftly, rapturously, intent and mindless at last, two essential white figures working into a tighter closer oneness of struggle, with a strange, octopus-like knotting and flashing of limbs in the subdued light of the room; a tense white knot of flesh gripped in silence between the walls of old brown books. Now and again came a sharp gasp of breath, or a sound like a sigh, then the rapid thudding of movement on the thickly-carpeted floor, then the strange sound of flesh escaping under flesh. Often, in the white interlaced knot of violent living being that swayed silently, there was no head to be seen, only the swift, tight limbs, the solid white backs, the physical junction of two bodies clinched into oneness. Then would appear the gleaming, ruffled head of Gerald, as the struggle changed, then for a moment the dun-coloured, shadow-like head of the other man would lift up from the conflict, the eyes wide and dreadful and sightless.
于是他们迅速地、兴高采烈地、全神贯注地、无意识地摔跤，两个基本的白色人物在斗争中变得更加紧密，在房间柔和的光线下，四肢像章鱼一样奇怪地打结和闪烁。一堆紧张的白色肉疙瘩静静地夹在棕色旧书的墙壁之间。时不时地传来一声急促的喘息声，或者一声类似叹息的声音，然后是厚地毯地板上快速移动的重击声，然后是肉体从肉体下逃逸的奇怪声音。通常，在无声摇曳的暴力生物的白色交错结中，看不到头部，只有敏捷而紧绷的四肢，坚实的白色背部，两个身体的物理连接紧密结合在一起。然后，随着斗争的变化，杰拉尔德那闪闪发亮、皱巴巴的头就会出现，然后，有那么一会儿，另一个人的暗褐色、阴影般的头会从冲突中抬起来，眼睛睁得大大的，可怕的，看不见。

At length Gerald lay back inert on the carpet, his breast rising in great slow panting, whilst Birkin kneeled over him, almost unconscious. Birkin was much more exhausted. He caught little, short breaths, he could scarcely breathe any more. The earth seemed to tilt and sway, and a complete darkness was coming over his mind. He did not know what happened. He slid forward quite unconscious, over Gerald, and Gerald did not notice. Then he was half-conscious again, aware only of the strange tilting and sliding of the world. The world was sliding, everything was sliding off into the darkness. And he was sliding, endlessly, endlessly away.
最后，杰拉尔德一动不动地躺在地毯上，他的胸脯缓慢地喘息着，而伯金则跪在他身上，几乎失去知觉。伯金更加疲惫不堪。他的呼吸变得微弱、短促，他几乎无法呼吸了。大地似乎在倾斜摇晃，一片黑暗笼罩了他的脑海。他不知道发生了什么事。他毫无意识地向前滑去，越过杰拉德，而杰拉德没有注意到。然后他又陷入半昏迷状态，只感觉到世界奇怪的倾斜和滑动。世界在滑动，一切都在滑向黑暗。他正在滑行，无休无止，无休无止。

He came to consciousness again, hearing an immense knocking outside. What could be happening, what was it, the great hammer-stroke resounding through the house? He did not know. And then it came to him that it was his own heart beating. But that seemed impossible, the noise was outside. No, it was inside himself, it was his own heart. And the beating was painful, so strained, surcharged. He wondered if Gerald heard it. He did not know whether he were standing or lying or falling.
他再次清醒过来，听到外面传来巨大的敲门声。到底发生了什么？是什么？巨大的锤击声响彻整个房子？他不知道。然后他意识到那是他自己的心跳。但这似乎是不可能的，外面有噪音。不，是在他自己的内心，是他自己的心。殴打是痛苦的、紧张的、超负荷的。他想知道杰拉德是否听到了。他不知道自己是站着、躺着还是跌倒。

When he realised that he had fallen prostrate upon Gerald’s body he wondered, he was surprised. But he sat up, steadying himself with his hand and waiting for his heart to become stiller and less painful. It hurt very much, and took away his consciousness.
当他意识到自己已经倒在杰拉尔德的身上时，他感到很惊讶。但他坐了起来，用手稳住自己，等待自己的心变得更加平静，不再那么痛苦。疼得很厉害，夺走了他的意识。

Gerald however was still less conscious than Birkin. They waited dimly, in a sort of not-being, for many uncounted, unknown minutes.
然而，杰拉德的意识仍然不如伯金。他们茫然地等待了无数、未知的分钟。

‘Of course—‘ panted Gerald, ‘I didn’t have to be rough—with you—I had to keep back—my force—‘
“当然——”杰拉尔德气喘吁吁地说，“我不必对你粗暴——我必须保留——我的力量——”

Birkin heard the sound as if his own spirit stood behind him, outside him, and listened to it. His body was in a trance of exhaustion, his spirit heard thinly. His body could not answer. Only he knew his heart was getting quieter. He was divided entirely between his spirit, which stood outside, and knew, and his body, that was a plunging, unconscious stroke of blood.
伯金听到这个声音，就好像他自己的灵魂就站在他身后、体外，聆听着它。他的身体处于一种恍惚的疲惫状态，他的精神听得稀薄。他的身体无法回答。只有他知道，他的心越来越安静。他完全被分为两部分：他的精神，站在外面，知道，而他的身体，那是一股无意识的血流。

‘I could have thrown you—using violence—‘ panted Gerald. ‘But you beat me right enough.’
“我本可以用暴力把你扔下去的——”杰拉德气喘吁吁地说。 “但你打败我是对的。”

‘Yes,’ said Birkin, hardening his throat and producing the words in the tension there, ‘you’re much stronger than I—you could beat me—easily.’
“是的，”伯金咬紧牙关说道，“你比我强大得多——你可以轻松击败我。”

Then he relaxed again to the terrible plunging of his heart and his blood.
然后，他的心和血液剧烈地跳动，他再次放松下来。

‘It surprised me,’ panted Gerald, ‘what strength you’ve got. Almost supernatural.’
“这让我很惊讶，”杰拉德气喘吁吁地说，“你有多么强大的力量。”几乎是超自然的。

‘For a moment,’ said Birkin.
“一会儿，”伯金说。

He still heard as if it were his own disembodied spirit hearing, standing at some distance behind him. It drew nearer however, his spirit. And the violent striking of blood in his chest was sinking quieter, allowing his mind to come back. He realised that he was leaning with all his weight on the soft body of the other man. It startled him, because he thought he had withdrawn. He recovered himself, and sat up. But he was still vague and unestablished. He put out his hand to steady himself. It touched the hand of Gerald, that was lying out on the floor. And Gerald’s hand closed warm and sudden over Birkin’s, they remained exhausted and breathless, the one hand clasped closely over the other. It was Birkin whose hand, in swift response, had closed in a strong, warm clasp over the hand of the other. Gerald’s clasp had been sudden and momentaneous.
他仍然站在身后一段距离，听见仿佛是他自己的无形灵魂的听觉。然而，他的灵魂却越来越近了。胸口剧烈的血流渐渐平静下来，让他的思绪清醒过来。他意识到自己的全部重量都靠在了另一个男人柔软的身体上。这让他吃了一惊，因为他以为自己已经退缩了。他回过神来，坐了起来。但他的说法仍然含糊不清、不明确。他伸出手来稳住自己。它碰到了杰拉尔德躺在地板上的手。杰拉德的手突然温暖地握在伯金的手上，他们仍然疲惫不堪，气喘吁吁，一只手紧紧地握着另一只手。伯金的手迅速做出反应，紧紧地握住了对方的手。杰拉德的拥抱突然而瞬间。

The normal consciousness however was returning, ebbing back. Birkin could breathe almost naturally again. Gerald’s hand slowly withdrew, Birkin slowly, dazedly rose to his feet and went towards the table. He poured out a whiskey and soda. Gerald also came for a drink.
然而，正常的意识正在恢复，正在消退。伯金又可以几乎自然地呼吸了。杰拉尔德的手慢慢收回，伯金茫然地慢慢站起来，走向桌子。他倒了一杯威士忌和苏打水。杰拉德也来喝一杯。

‘It was a real set-to, wasn’t it?’ said Birkin, looking at Gerald with darkened eyes.
“这真是一场势均力敌的比赛，不是吗？”伯金用漆黑的眼睛看着杰拉德说道。

‘God, yes,’ said Gerald. He looked at the delicate body of the other man, and added: ‘It wasn’t too much for you, was it?’
“上帝，是的，”杰拉尔德说。他看着对方娇嫩的身体，补充道：“这对你来说并不算太多，不是吗？”

‘No. One ought to wrestle and strive and be physically close. It makes one sane.’
'不。一个人应该摔跤、努力、身体上靠近。它使人神志清醒。

‘You do think so?’
“你确实这么认为吗？”

‘I do. Don’t you?’
'我愿意。你不是吗？

‘Yes,’ said Gerald.
“是的，”杰拉德说。

There were long spaces of silence between their words. The wrestling had some deep meaning to them—an unfinished meaning.
他们的话语之间有很长的一段沉默。摔跤对他们来说有某种深刻的意义——一种未完成的意义。

‘We are mentally, spiritually intimate, therefore we should be more or less physically intimate too—it is more whole.’
“我们在精神上、精神上都很亲密，因此我们在身体上也应该或多或少地亲密——这样更完整。”

‘Certainly it is,’ said Gerald. Then he laughed pleasantly, adding: ‘It’s rather wonderful to me.’ He stretched out his arms handsomely.
“当然是这样，”杰拉尔德说。然后他愉快地笑起来，补充道：“这对我来说真是太棒了。”他帅气地伸出双臂。

‘Yes,’ said Birkin. ‘I don’t know why one should have to justify oneself.’
“是的，”伯金说。 “我不知道为什么一个人必须为自己辩护。”

‘No.’
'不。'

The two men began to dress.
两个人开始穿衣服。

‘I think also that you are beautiful,’ said Birkin to Gerald, ‘and that is enjoyable too. One should enjoy what is given.’
“我也认为你很漂亮，”伯金对杰拉德说，“这也很令人愉快。”人们应该享受所给予的东西。

‘You think I am beautiful—how do you mean, physically?’ asked Gerald, his eyes glistening.
“你认为我很漂亮——这是什么意思，身体上的？”杰拉德问道，他的眼睛闪闪发光。

‘Yes. You have a northern kind of beauty, like light refracted from snow—and a beautiful, plastic form. Yes, that is there to enjoy as well. We should enjoy everything.’
'是的。你有一种北方的美，就像雪折射的光一样——还有美丽的、可塑的形状。是的，那也是可以享受的。我们应该享受一切。

Gerald laughed in his throat, and said:
杰拉尔德喉咙里笑了起来，说道：

‘That’s certainly one way of looking at it. I can say this much, I feel better. It has certainly helped me. Is this the Bruderschaft you wanted?’
“这当然是看待问题的一种方式。我能说这么多，我感觉好多了。这确实对我有帮助。这就是你想要的 Bruderschaft 吗？

‘Perhaps. Do you think this pledges anything?’
'也许。你认为这有什么承诺吗？

‘I don’t know,’ laughed Gerald.
“我不知道，”杰拉尔德笑道。

‘At any rate, one feels freer and more open now—and that is what we want.’
“无论如何，人们现在感觉更自由、更开放——这就是我们想要的。”

‘Certainly,’ said Gerald.
“当然，”杰拉尔德说。

They drew to the fire, with the decanters and the glasses and the food.
他们带着酒瓶、玻璃杯和食物来到火边。

‘I always eat a little before I go to bed,’ said Gerald. ‘I sleep better.’
“我睡觉前总是吃一点，”杰拉德说。 “我睡得更好了。”

‘I should not sleep so well,’ said Birkin.
“我不应该睡得这么好，”伯金说。

‘No? There you are, we are not alike. I’ll put a dressing-gown on.’ Birkin remained alone, looking at the fire. His mind had reverted to Ursula. She seemed to return again into his consciousness. Gerald came down wearing a gown of broad-barred, thick black-and-green silk, brilliant and striking.
'不？原来如此，我们不一样。我会穿上晨衣。”伯金独自一人，看着火。他的思绪又回到了乌苏拉身上。她似乎又回到了他的意识之中。杰拉德下来时穿着一件宽条纹厚黑绿丝绸长袍，光彩夺目，引人注目。

‘You are very fine,’ said Birkin, looking at the full robe.
“你很好，”伯金看着整件长袍说道。

‘It was a caftan in Bokhara,’ said Gerald. ‘I like it.’
“那是博卡拉的一件长袍，”杰拉尔德说。 '我喜欢。'

‘I like it too.’
'我也喜欢这个。'

Birkin was silent, thinking how scrupulous Gerald was in his attire, how expensive too. He wore silk socks, and studs of fine workmanship, and silk underclothing, and silk braces. Curious! This was another of the differences between them. Birkin was careless and unimaginative about his own appearance.
伯金沉默不语，心想杰拉德的衣着是多么讲究，也多么昂贵。他穿着丝绸袜子、做工精细的饰钉、丝绸内衣和丝绸背带。好奇的！这是他们之间的另一个区别。伯金对自己的外表粗心且缺乏想象力。

‘Of course you,’ said Gerald, as if he had been thinking; ‘there’s something curious about you. You’re curiously strong. One doesn’t expect it, it is rather surprising.’
“当然是你，”杰拉尔德说道，仿佛他一直在思考。 ‘你身上有些奇怪的东西。你出奇地坚强。出乎意料的是，这是相当令人惊讶的。

Birkin laughed. He was looking at the handsome figure of the other man, blond and comely in the rich robe, and he was half thinking of the difference between it and himself—so different; as far, perhaps, apart as man from woman, yet in another direction. But really it was Ursula, it was the woman who was gaining ascendance over Birkin’s being, at this moment. Gerald was becoming dim again, lapsing out of him.
伯金笑了。他看着另一个男人英俊的身材，金发碧眼，穿着华丽的长袍，俊美俊美，他一半在思考这个男人和他自己之间的区别——如此不同；如此不同。或许，男人和女人之间的距离很远，但却是在另一个方向。但事实上，这就是乌苏拉，这个女人此时此刻正在超越伯金的存在。杰拉德再次变得昏暗，从他身上消失了。

‘Do you know,’ he said suddenly, ‘I went and proposed to Ursula Brangwen tonight, that she should marry me.’
“你知道吗，”他突然说道，“今晚我去向乌苏拉·布朗文求婚，她应该嫁给我。”

He saw the blank shining wonder come over Gerald’s face.
他看到杰拉尔德脸上闪现出茫然、闪亮的惊奇。

‘You did?’
“你做到了？”

‘Yes. Almost formally—speaking first to her father, as it should be, in the world—though that was accident—or mischief.’
'是的。几乎是正式的——首先对她的父亲说话，这是应该的，在这个世界上——尽管那是意外——或者说是恶作剧。

Gerald only stared in wonder, as if he did not grasp.
杰拉尔德只是惊讶地看着，好像没有明白。

‘You don’t mean to say that you seriously went and asked her father to let you marry her?’
“你该不会是说你认真地去请求她父亲让你娶她吧？”

‘Yes,’ said Birkin, ‘I did.’
“是的，”伯金说，“我做到了。”

‘What, had you spoken to her before about it, then?’
“怎么，你之前跟她谈过这件事吗？”

‘No, not a word. I suddenly thought I would go there and ask her—and her father happened to come instead of her—so I asked him first.’
‘不，一个字也没有。我突然想到我应该去那里问她——而她的父亲碰巧代替她来了——所以我先问了他。

‘If you could have her?’ concluded Gerald.
“如果你能拥有她的话？”杰拉德总结道。

‘Ye-es, that.’
“是的，就是那个。”

‘And you didn’t speak to her?’
“你没跟她说话吗？”

‘Yes. She came in afterwards. So it was put to her as well.’
'是的。她后来进来了。所以它也交给了她。

‘It was! And what did she say then? You’re an engaged man?’
'它是！然后她说什么了？你已经订婚了？

‘No,—she only said she didn’t want to be bullied into answering.’
“不，她只是说她不想被胁迫回答。”

‘She what?’
“她什么？”

‘Said she didn’t want to be bullied into answering.’
“她说她不想被胁迫才回答。”

‘’Said she didn’t want to be bullied into answering!’ Why, what did she mean by that?’
“她说她不想被胁迫才回答！”为什么，她这是什么意思？

Birkin raised his shoulders. ‘Can’t say,’ he answered. ‘Didn’t want to be bothered just then, I suppose.’
伯金抬起肩膀。 “不能说，”他回答道。 “我想当时不想被打扰。”

‘But is this really so? And what did you do then?’
‘但事实真的是这样吗？然后你做了什么？

‘I walked out of the house and came here.’
“我走出房子来到这里。”

‘You came straight here?’
“你是直接来这里的吗？”

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

Gerald stared in amazement and amusement. He could not take it in.
杰拉尔德惊讶而有趣地看着。他无法接受。

‘But is this really true, as you say it now?’
“但这真的如你现在所说的那样吗？”

‘Word for word.’
'一个字一个字地。'

‘It is?’
'这是？'

He leaned back in his chair, filled with delight and amusement.
他靠在椅子上，心里充满了喜悦和乐趣。

‘Well, that’s good,’ he said. ‘And so you came here to wrestle with your good angel, did you?’
“嗯，那很好，”他说。 “所以你来这里是为了和你的善良天使摔跤，是吗？”

‘Did I?’ said Birkin.
“是吗？”伯金说。

‘Well, it looks like it. Isn’t that what you did?’
‘嗯，看起来是这样。这不是你做的吗？

Now Birkin could not follow Gerald’s meaning.
现在伯金无法理解杰拉德的意思。

‘And what’s going to happen?’ said Gerald. ‘You’re going to keep open the proposition, so to speak?’
“那么接下来会发生什么呢？”杰拉德问道。 “可以这么说，你会继续开放这个提议吗？”

‘I suppose so. I vowed to myself I would see them all to the devil. But I suppose I shall ask her again, in a little while.’
'我想是这样。我向自己发誓，我要把他们全部见鬼去。但我想一会儿我会再问她一次。”

Gerald watched him steadily.
杰拉德目不转睛地看着他。

‘So you’re fond of her then?’ he asked.
“那么你喜欢她吗？”他问。

‘I think—I love her,’ said Birkin, his face going very still and fixed.
“我想——我爱她，”伯金说道，他的表情非常平静。

Gerald glistened for a moment with pleasure, as if it were something done specially to please him. Then his face assumed a fitting gravity, and he nodded his head slowly.
杰拉德一时高兴得闪闪发亮，仿佛这是专门为了取悦他而做的事情。然后他的脸变得严肃起来，慢慢地点了点头。

‘You know,’ he said, ‘I always believed in love—true love. But where does one find it nowadays?’
“你知道，”他说，“我一直相信爱——真爱。”但如今人们在哪里可以找到它呢？

‘I don’t know,’ said Birkin.
“我不知道，”伯金说。

‘Very rarely,’ said Gerald. Then, after a pause, ‘I’ve never felt it myself—not what I should call love. I’ve gone after women—and been keen enough over some of them. But I’ve never felt LOVE. I don’t believe I’ve ever felt as much LOVE for a woman, as I have for you—not LOVE. You understand what I mean?’
“很少见，”杰拉德说。然后，停顿了一下，“我自己从来没有感受到过——这不是我应该称之为爱的东西。”我曾经追求过女性，并且对其中的一些女性非常热衷。但我从未感受过爱。我不相信我对一个女人有过像对你那样多的爱——不是爱。你明白我的意思吗？

‘Yes. I’m sure you’ve never loved a woman.’
'是的。我确信你从来没有爱过一个女人。

‘You feel that, do you? And do you think I ever shall? You understand what I mean?’ He put his hand to his breast, closing his fist there, as if he would draw something out. ‘I mean that—that I can’t express what it is, but I know it.’
‘你有这种感觉，是吗？你认为我会吗？你明白我的意思吗？”他把手放在胸前，握紧拳头，仿佛要抽出什么东西。 “我的意思是——我无法表达它是什么，但我知道它。”

‘What is it, then?’ asked Birkin.
“那是什么？”伯金问道。

‘You see, I can’t put it into words. I mean, at any rate, something abiding, something that can’t change—‘
‘你看，我无法用语言来表达。我的意思是，无论如何，一些持久的、无法改变的东西——”

His eyes were bright and puzzled.
他的眼睛明亮而困惑。

‘Now do you think I shall ever feel that for a woman?’ he said, anxiously.
“你认为我会对一个女人有这种感觉吗？”他焦急地说道。

Birkin looked at him, and shook his head.
伯金看着他，摇了摇头。

‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘I could not say.’
“我不知道，”他说。 “我不能说。”

Gerald had been on the QUI VIVE, as awaiting his fate. Now he drew back in his chair.
杰拉德一直在《QUI VIVE》上，等待着他的命运。现在他向后靠在椅子上。

‘No,’ he said, ‘and neither do I, and neither do I.’
“不，”他说，“我也不，我也不。”

‘We are different, you and I,’ said Birkin. ‘I can’t tell your life.’
“我们是不同的，你和我，”伯金说。 “我无法告诉你的生活。”

‘No,’ said Gerald, ‘no more can I. But I tell you—I begin to doubt it!’
“不，”杰拉德说，“我不能再这样了。但我告诉你——我开始怀疑了！”

‘That you will ever love a woman?’
“你会永远爱一个女人吗？”

‘Well—yes—what you would truly call love—‘
“嗯——是的——你真正称之为爱的东西——”

‘You doubt it?’
“你对此表示怀疑吗？”

‘Well—I begin to.’
“嗯——我开始了。”

There was a long pause.
出现了长时间的停顿。

‘Life has all kinds of things,’ said Birkin. ‘There isn’t only one road.’
“生活中有各种各样的事情，”伯金说。 “并不只有一条路。”

‘Yes, I believe that too. I believe it. And mind you, I don’t care how it is with me—I don’t care how it is—so long as I don’t feel—‘ he paused, and a blank, barren look passed over his face, to express his feeling—‘so long as I feel I’ve LIVED, somehow—and I don’t care how it is—but I want to feel that—‘
‘是的，我也相信这一点。我相信这个。请注意，我不在乎我的情况如何——我不在乎情况如何——只要我感觉不到——”他停顿了一下，脸上闪过一丝茫然、贫瘠的表情，以表达他的感觉——“只要我觉得我还活着，不管怎样——我不在乎它是怎样的——但我想感觉到——”

‘Fulfilled,’ said Birkin.
“完成了，”伯金说。

‘We-ell, perhaps it is fulfilled; I don’t use the same words as you.’
‘好吧，也许它已经实现了；我不会用和你一样的词。

‘It is the same.’
'这是相同的。'

CHAPTER XXI
第二十一章

THRESHOLD
临界点

Gudrun was away in London, having a little show of her work, with a friend, and looking round, preparing for flight from Beldover. Come what might she would be on the wing in a very short time. She received a letter from Winifred Crich, ornamented with drawings.
古德伦正在伦敦，与一位朋友一起展示她的作品，然后环顾四周，准备从贝尔多弗起飞。无论发生什么事，她都会在很短的时间内出现在侧翼。她收到了温妮弗雷德·克里奇的一封信，信上装饰着图画。

‘Father also has been to London, to be examined by the doctors. It made him very tired. They say he must rest a very great deal, so he is mostly in bed. He brought me a lovely tropical parrot in faience, of Dresden ware, also a man ploughing, and two mice climbing up a stalk, also in faience. The mice were Copenhagen ware. They are the best, but mice don’t shine so much, otherwise they are very good, their tails are slim and long. They all shine nearly like glass. Of course it is the glaze, but I don’t like it. Gerald likes the man ploughing the best, his trousers are torn, he is ploughing with an ox, being I suppose a German peasant. It is all grey and white, white shirt and grey trousers, but very shiny and clean. Mr Birkin likes the girl best, under the hawthorn blossom, with a lamb, and with daffodils painted on her skirts, in the drawing room. But that is silly, because the lamb is not a real lamb, and she is silly too.
“父亲也去过伦敦，接受医生检查。这让他很累。他们说他必须多休息，所以他大部分时间都在床上。他给我带来了一只可爱的热带鹦鹉，上面是德累斯顿瓷器的彩陶，也是一个犁地的人，还有两只老鼠爬上一根同样是彩陶的茎。老鼠是哥本哈根器皿。它们是最好的，但是老鼠没有那么闪亮，否则它们很好，它们的尾巴又细又长。它们几乎都像玻璃一样闪闪发光。当然是釉料，但我不喜欢它。杰拉尔德最喜欢犁地的人，他的裤子破了，他正在用牛犁地，我猜他是德国农民。都是灰白色的，白衬衫，灰裤子，但是非常闪亮干净。伯金先生最喜欢客厅里那个在山楂花下、抱着一只小羊、裙子上画着水仙花的女孩。但这很傻，因为小羊不是真正的小羊，而且她也很傻。

‘Dear Miss Brangwen, are you coming back soon, you are very much missed here. I enclose a drawing of father sitting up in bed. He says he hopes you are not going to forsake us. Oh dear Miss Brangwen, I am sure you won’t. Do come back and draw the ferrets, they are the most lovely noble darlings in the world. We might carve them in holly-wood, playing against a background of green leaves. Oh do let us, for they are most beautiful.
“亲爱的布兰文小姐，你很快就会回来吗，这里非常想念你。”我附上一张父亲坐在床上的图画。他说他希望你不要抛弃我们。哦，亲爱的布兰文小姐，我相信你不会。一定要回来画雪貂，它们是世界上最可爱的高贵宠儿。我们可能会将它们雕刻成好莱坞风格，在绿叶背景下演奏。噢，让我们一起吧，因为它们是最美丽的。

‘Father says we might have a studio. Gerald says we could easily have a beautiful one over the stables, it would only need windows to be put in the slant of the roof, which is a simple matter. Then you could stay here all day and work, and we could live in the studio, like two real artists, like the man in the picture in the hall, with the frying-pan and the walls all covered with drawings. I long to be free, to live the free life of an artist. Even Gerald told father that only an artist is free, because he lives in a creative world of his own—‘
“父亲说我们可能有一个工作室。杰拉尔德说，我们可以很容易地在马厩上建一个漂亮的窗户，只需要在屋顶的倾斜处安装窗户，这是一件简单的事情。然后你可以整天呆在这里工作，我们可以住在工作室里，就像两个真正的艺术家，就像大厅里画里的那个人，煎锅和墙上都画满了图画。我渴望自由，渴望过艺术家自由的生活。甚至杰拉尔德也告诉父亲，只有艺术家才是自由的，因为他生活在自己的创意世界中——”

Gudrun caught the drift of the family intentions, in this letter. Gerald wanted her to be attached to the household at Shortlands, he was using Winifred as his stalking-horse. The father thought only of his child, he saw a rock of salvation in Gudrun. And Gudrun admired him for his perspicacity. The child, moreover, was really exceptional. Gudrun was quite content. She was quite willing, given a studio, to spend her days at Shortlands. She disliked the Grammar School already thoroughly, she wanted to be free. If a studio were provided, she would be free to go on with her work, she would await the turn of events with complete serenity. And she was really interested in Winifred, she would be quite glad to understand the girl.
古德伦在这封信中领会了家庭的意图。杰拉尔德希望她能融入肖特兰家族，他利用威妮弗雷德作为他的替身。父亲只想着他的孩子，他在古德伦身上看到了拯救的磐石。古珍钦佩他的洞察力。而且，这个孩子也确实很特别。古德伦很满足。如果有一个工作室，她非常愿意在肖特兰度过她的日子。她已经彻底不喜欢文法学校了，她想要自由。如果提供一个工作室，她就可以自由地继续她的工作，她会完全平静地等待事态的发展。而且她真的对威妮弗雷德很感兴趣，她会很高兴了解这个女孩。

So there was quite a little festivity on Winifred’s account, the day Gudrun returned to Shortlands.
因此，古德伦回到肖特兰的那天，威妮弗雷德的帐户上充满了庆祝活动。

‘You should make a bunch of flowers to give to Miss Brangwen when she arrives,’ Gerald said smiling to his sister.
“你应该做一束花，当布兰文小姐到来时送给她，”杰拉德微笑着对他的妹妹说。

‘Oh no,’ cried Winifred, ‘it’s silly.’
“哦，不，”威妮弗雷德喊道，“这太愚蠢了。”

‘Not at all. It is a very charming and ordinary attention.’
'一点也不。这是一种非常迷人而又平凡的关注。

‘Oh, it is silly,’ protested Winifred, with all the extreme MAUVAISE HONTE of her years. Nevertheless, the idea appealed to her. She wanted very much to carry it out. She flitted round the green-houses and the conservatory looking wistfully at the flowers on their stems. And the more she looked, the more she LONGED to have a bunch of the blossoms she saw, the more fascinated she became with her little vision of ceremony, and the more consumedly shy and self-conscious she grew, till she was almost beside herself. She could not get the idea out of her mind. It was as if some haunting challenge prompted her, and she had not enough courage to take it up. So again she drifted into the green-houses, looking at the lovely roses in their pots, and at the virginal cyclamens, and at the mystic white clusters of a creeper. The beauty, oh the beauty of them, and oh the paradisal bliss, if she should have a perfect bouquet and could give it to Gudrun the next day. Her passion and her complete indecision almost made her ill.
“哦，这太愚蠢了，”威妮弗雷德抗议道，她带着她这些年的极端莫韦斯洪特风格。尽管如此，这个想法还是吸引了她。她非常想把它实现。她在温室和温室里飞来飞去，若有所思地看着茎上的花朵。她看得越多，就越渴望拥有一束她看到的花朵，她对自己那小小的仪式幻想越着迷，她就越害羞和难为情，直到她几乎发疯了。 。她无法摆脱这个想法。仿佛有什么难以忘怀的挑战在催促着她，而她却没有足够的勇气去接受。于是她又走进了温室，看着花盆里可爱的玫瑰，看着原始的仙客来，还有神秘的白色爬山虎丛。多么美丽，噢，它们多么美丽，多么天堂般的幸福啊，如果她能有一束完美的花束，并能在第二天把它送给古德伦的话。她的热情和优柔寡断几乎让她生病了。

At last she slid to her father’s side.
最后她滑到了父亲身边。

‘Daddie—‘ she said.
“爸爸——”她说。

‘What, my precious?’
“什么，亲爱的？”

But she hung back, the tears almost coming to her eyes, in her sensitive confusion. Her father looked at her, and his heart ran hot with tenderness, an anguish of poignant love.
但她却犹豫不决，在敏感的困惑中，泪水几乎夺眶而出。父亲看着她，心中泛起温柔，一种浓浓的爱的痛苦。

‘What do you want to say to me, my love?’
“亲爱的，你想对我说什么？”

‘Daddie—!’ her eyes smiled laconically—‘isn’t it silly if I give Miss Brangwen some flowers when she comes?’
“爸爸——！”她的眼睛简洁地微笑着——“如果我在布兰文小姐来的时候送她一些花，不是很傻吗？”

The sick man looked at the bright, knowing eyes of his child, and his heart burned with love.
病人看着孩子那双明亮、懂事的眼睛，心中充满了爱。

‘No, darling, that’s not silly. It’s what they do to queens.’
“不，亲爱的，这并不傻。这就是他们对女王所做的事情。”

This was not very reassuring to Winifred. She half suspected that queens in themselves were a silliness. Yet she so wanted her little romantic occasion.
这让威妮弗雷德不太放心。她有点怀疑女王本身就是愚蠢的。然而她非常想要这个小小的浪漫时刻。

‘Shall I then?’ she asked.
“那我可以吗？”她问道。

‘Give Miss Brangwen some flowers? Do, Birdie. Tell Wilson I say you are to have what you want.’
“给布兰文小姐一些花吗？”做吧，小鸟。告诉威尔逊，我说你应该得到你想要的东西。

The child smiled a small, subtle, unconscious smile to herself, in anticipation of her way.
孩子不自觉地微笑着，期待着她的到来。

‘But I won’t get them till tomorrow,’ she said.
“但我要到明天才能拿到，”她说。

‘Not till tomorrow, Birdie. Give me a kiss then—‘
“明天再说吧，小鸟。”那么给我一个吻——”

Winifred silently kissed the sick man, and drifted out of the room. She again went the round of the green-houses and the conservatory, informing the gardener, in her high, peremptory, simple fashion, of what she wanted, telling him all the blooms she had selected.
威妮弗雷德默默地吻了吻病人，然后飘出了房间。她再次巡视了温室和暖房，以她高傲、专横、简单的方式告诉园丁她想要什么，告诉他她选择的所有花朵。

‘What do you want these for?’ Wilson asked.
“你要这些做什么？”威尔逊问。

‘I want them,’ she said. She wished servants did not ask questions.
“我想要它们，”她说。她希望仆人不要问问题。

‘Ay, you’ve said as much. But what do you want them for, for decoration, or to send away, or what?’
‘哎呀，你也说了这么多了。但你想要它们做什么，装饰，或者送走，或者什么？

‘I want them for a presentation bouquet.’
“我想要它们作为演示花束。”

‘A presentation bouquet! Who’s coming then?—the Duchess of Portland?’
‘演示花束！那么谁会来呢？——波特兰公爵夫人？

‘No.’
'不。'

‘Oh, not her? Well you’ll have a rare poppy-show if you put all the things you’ve mentioned into your bouquet.’
哦，不是她吗？好吧，如果你把你提到的所有东西都放进你的花束里，你就会看到一场罕见的罂粟花秀。

‘Yes, I want a rare poppy-show.’
“是的，我想要一场罕见的罂粟花表演。”

‘You do! Then there’s no more to be said.’
'你做！那么就没有什么可说的了。

The next day Winifred, in a dress of silvery velvet, and holding a gaudy bunch of flowers in her hand, waited with keen impatience in the schoolroom, looking down the drive for Gudrun’s arrival. It was a wet morning. Under her nose was the strange fragrance of hot-house flowers, the bunch was like a little fire to her, she seemed to have a strange new fire in her heart. This slight sense of romance stirred her like an intoxicant.
第二天，威妮弗雷德穿着银色天鹅绒连衣裙，手里拿着一束艳丽的鲜花，焦急地在教室里等着，眼睛望着车道，等待着古德伦的到来。那是一个潮湿的早晨。她的鼻子底下弥漫着奇异的温室花香，那一束花对她来说就像是一团小火，她的心里仿佛又燃起了一股奇异的新火。这种淡淡的浪漫感就像是一种麻醉剂一样让她兴奋不已。

At last she saw Gudrun coming, and she ran downstairs to warn her father and Gerald. They, laughing at her anxiety and gravity, came with her into the hall. The man-servant came hastening to the door, and there he was, relieving Gudrun of her umbrella, and then of her raincoat. The welcoming party hung back till their visitor entered the hall.
最后她看到古德伦来了，她跑下楼去警告她的父亲和杰拉尔德。他们嘲笑她的焦虑和严肃，跟着她走进大厅。男仆急忙跑到门口，帮古珍脱下雨伞，又脱下雨衣。欢迎队伍一直等待着，直到客人进入大厅。

Gudrun was flushed with the rain, her hair was blown in loose little curls, she was like a flower just opened in the rain, the heart of the blossom just newly visible, seeming to emit a warmth of retained sunshine. Gerald winced in spirit, seeing her so beautiful and unknown. She was wearing a soft blue dress, and her stockings were of dark red.
古珍被雨水冲得通红，头发被吹成了松散的小卷，她就像一朵在雨中刚刚开放的花，花心刚刚露出来，似乎散发着残留的阳光的温暖。看到她如此美丽却又如此陌生，杰拉德心里不禁皱起了眉头。她穿着一件柔和的蓝色连衣裙，长筒袜是深红色的。

Winifred advanced with odd, stately formality.
威妮弗雷德以一种奇怪而庄严的礼节走上前来。

‘We are so glad you’ve come back,’ she said. ‘These are your flowers.’ She presented the bouquet.
“我们很高兴你回来了，”她说。 “这些是你的花。”她递上花束。

‘Mine!’ cried Gudrun. She was suspended for a moment, then a vivid flush went over her, she was as if blinded for a moment with a flame of pleasure. Then her eyes, strange and flaming, lifted and looked at the father, and at Gerald. And again Gerald shrank in spirit, as if it would be more than he could bear, as her hot, exposed eyes rested on him. There was something so revealed, she was revealed beyond bearing, to his eyes. He turned his face aside. And he felt he would not be able to avert her. And he writhed under the imprisonment.
“我的！”古德伦喊道。她愣了一会儿，然后脸上泛起红晕，一时之间她仿佛被快乐的火焰蒙蔽了双眼。然后她抬起眼睛，奇怪而炽热，看着父亲，又看着杰拉德。当她那双赤裸的、炽热的眼睛落在他身上时，杰拉德再次感到精神上的畏缩，仿佛这超出了他的承受能力。在他的眼中，有一些东西如此显露，她无法承受。他把脸转向一边。他觉得自己无法避开她。他在禁锢之下痛苦不堪。

Gudrun put her face into the flowers.
古珍把脸埋进花里。

‘But how beautiful they are!’ she said, in a muffled voice. Then, with a strange, suddenly revealed passion, she stooped and kissed Winifred.
“但是它们多么美丽啊！”她低声说道。然后，带着一种奇怪的、突然流露的激情，她弯下腰吻了温妮弗雷德。

Mr Crich went forward with his hand held out to her.
克里奇先生走上前，向她伸出手。

‘I was afraid you were going to run away from us,’ he said, playfully.
“我担心你会从我们身边逃跑，”他开玩笑地说。

Gudrun looked up at him with a luminous, roguish, unknown face.
古德伦抬头看着他，脸上露出一张明亮、淘气、陌生的脸。

‘Really!’ she replied. ‘No, I didn’t want to stay in London.’ Her voice seemed to imply that she was glad to get back to Shortlands, her tone was warm and subtly caressing.
“真的！”她回答道。 “不，我不想留在伦敦。”她的声音似乎暗示着她很高兴回到肖特兰兹，语气温暖，带着微妙的爱抚。

‘That is a good thing,’ smiled the father. ‘You see you are very welcome here among us.’
父亲微笑着说：“这是一件好事。” “你看，我们很欢迎你。”

Gudrun only looked into his face with dark-blue, warm, shy eyes. She was unconsciously carried away by her own power.
古德伦只是用深蓝色、温暖、害羞的眼睛看着他的脸。她不自觉地被自己的力量冲昏了头脑。

‘And you look as if you came home in every possible triumph,’ Mr Crich continued, holding her hand.
“你看起来好像带着一切可能的胜利回家了，”克里奇先生握着她的手继续说道。

‘No,’ she said, glowing strangely. ‘I haven’t had any triumph till I came here.’
“不，”她说，脸上露出奇怪的光芒。 “在我来到这里之前，我还没有取得过任何胜利。”

‘Ah, come, come! We’re not going to hear any of those tales. Haven’t we read notices in the newspaper, Gerald?’
‘啊，来来来！我们不会听到任何这些故事。杰拉德，我们没有读过报纸上的通知吗？

‘You came off pretty well,’ said Gerald to her, shaking hands. ‘Did you sell anything?’
“你表现得很好，”杰拉尔德一边握手一边对她说。 “你卖过东西吗？”

‘No,’ she said, ‘not much.’
“不，”她说，“不多。”

‘Just as well,’ he said.
“那也好，”他说。

She wondered what he meant. But she was all aglow with her reception, carried away by this little flattering ceremonial on her behalf.
她想知道他的意思。但她对这次的接待感到非常高兴，被这个为她举办的小型奉承仪式冲昏了头脑。

‘Winifred,’ said the father, ‘have you a pair of shoes for Miss Brangwen? You had better change at once—‘
“威妮弗雷德，”父亲说，“你有给布兰文小姐一双鞋吗？你最好立即改变——”

Gudrun went out with her bouquet in her hand.
古珍手里拿着花走了出去。

‘Quite a remarkable young woman,’ said the father to Gerald, when she had gone.
“真是一位了不起的年轻女子，”她走后，父亲对杰拉尔德说。

‘Yes,’ replied Gerald briefly, as if he did not like the observation.
“是的，”杰拉德简短地回答道，好像他不喜欢这个观察。

Mr Crich liked Gudrun to sit with him for half an hour. Usually he was ashy and wretched, with all the life gnawed out of him. But as soon as he rallied, he liked to make believe that he was just as before, quite well and in the midst of life—not of the outer world, but in the midst of a strong essential life. And to this belief, Gudrun contributed perfectly. With her, he could get by stimulation those precious half-hours of strength and exaltation and pure freedom, when he seemed to live more than he had ever lived.
克里奇先生喜欢古德伦陪他坐半个小时。通常他面色苍白、可怜兮兮，所有的生命都被吞噬殆尽。但一旦他振作起来，他就喜欢相信自己和以前一样，一切都很好，而且正处于生活之中——不是外部世界，而是处于一种强大的本质生活之中。对于这一信念，古德伦做出了完美的贡献。和她在一起，他可以通过刺激获得宝贵的半个小时的力量、兴奋和纯粹的自由，此时他似乎比以往任何时候都活得更充实。

She came to him as he lay propped up in the library. His face was like yellow wax, his eyes darkened, as it were sightless. His black beard, now streaked with grey, seemed to spring out of the waxy flesh of a corpse. Yet the atmosphere about him was energetic and playful. Gudrun subscribed to this, perfectly. To her fancy, he was just an ordinary man. Only his rather terrible appearance was photographed upon her soul, away beneath her consciousness. She knew that, in spite of his playfulness, his eyes could not change from their darkened vacancy, they were the eyes of a man who is dead.
当他躺在图书馆里时，她来到了他身边。他的脸色如黄蜡，双目漆黑，如同失明。他的黑胡子现在已经变成了灰色，看起来像是从尸体的蜡质肉中长出来的。但他周围的气氛却充满活力和俏皮。古德伦完全同意这一点。在她看来，他只是一个普通的男人。只有他相当可怕的外表被记录在她的灵魂中，远离她的意识。她知道，尽管他很顽皮，但他的眼睛却无法从黑暗空洞中改变，那是一个死人的眼睛。

‘Ah, this is Miss Brangwen,’ he said, suddenly rousing as she entered, announced by the man-servant. ‘Thomas, put Miss Brangwen a chair here—that’s right.’ He looked at her soft, fresh face with pleasure. It gave him the illusion of life. ‘Now, you will have a glass of sherry and a little piece of cake. Thomas—‘
“啊，这是布兰文小姐，”当男仆宣布她进来时，他突然惊醒了。 “托马斯，把布兰文小姐放在这里——没错。”他高兴地看着她柔软、清新的脸。这给了他一种生活的错觉。 “现在，您将喝一杯雪利酒和一小块蛋糕。托马斯——‘

‘No thank you,’ said Gudrun. And as soon as she had said it, her heart sank horribly. The sick man seemed to fall into a gap of death, at her contradiction. She ought to play up to him, not to contravene him. In an instant she was smiling her rather roguish smile.
“不，谢谢，”古德伦说。而这句话一出口，她的心就狠狠的沉了下去。在她的反驳下，病人似乎陷入了死亡的深渊。她应该迎合他，而不是违背他。刹那间，她露出了相当淘气的笑容。

‘I don’t like sherry very much,’ she said. ‘But I like almost anything else.’
“我不太喜欢雪利酒，”她说。 “但我几乎喜欢其他任何东西。”

The sick man caught at this straw instantly.
病人立刻抓住了这根稻草。

‘Not sherry! No! Something else! What then? What is there, Thomas?’
“不是雪利酒！不！还有别的事！然后怎样呢？托马斯，那是什么？

‘Port wine—curacao—‘
“波特酒——库拉索岛——”

‘I would love some curacao—‘ said Gudrun, looking at the sick man confidingly.
“我想要一些柑橘酒——”古德伦说道，充满信心地看着病人。

‘You would. Well then Thomas, curacao—and a little cake, or a biscuit?’
'你会。那么托马斯，库拉索岛——还有一点蛋糕，还是一块饼干？

‘A biscuit,’ said Gudrun. She did not want anything, but she was wise.
“一块饼干，”古德伦说。她什么都不想要，但她很聪明。

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

He waited till she was settled with her little glass and her biscuit. Then he was satisfied.
他一直等到她拿着小玻璃杯和饼干安顿下来。然后他就满足了。

‘You have heard the plan,’ he said with some excitement, ‘for a studio for Winifred, over the stables?’
“你听说过这个计划，”他有些兴奋地说，“在马厩上方为威妮弗雷德建一个工作室？”

‘No!’ exclaimed Gudrun, in mock wonder.
“不！”古德伦假装惊讶地喊道。

‘Oh!—I thought Winnie wrote it to you, in her letter!’
“哦！——我以为温妮是在信里写给你的！”

‘Oh—yes—of course. But I thought perhaps it was only her own little idea—‘ Gudrun smiled subtly, indulgently. The sick man smiled also, elated.
'哦，是的，当然。但我想这也许只是她自己的小主意——”古德伦微妙而宽容地微笑着。病人也高兴地笑了。

‘Oh no. It is a real project. There is a good room under the roof of the stables—with sloping rafters. We had thought of converting it into a studio.’
'不好了。这是一个真实的项目。马厩的屋顶下有一个很好的房间——有倾斜的椽子。我们曾想过将其改造成工作室。

‘How VERY nice that would be!’ cried Gudrun, with excited warmth. The thought of the rafters stirred her.
“那该多好啊！”古德伦兴奋地热情地喊道。椽子的想法让她激动不已。

‘You think it would? Well, it can be done.’
‘你认为会吗？嗯，这是可以做到的。

‘But how perfectly splendid for Winifred! Of course, it is just what is needed, if she is to work at all seriously. One must have one’s workshop, otherwise one never ceases to be an amateur.’
“但是对于威妮弗雷德来说，这是多么完美啊！当然，如果她要认真工作，这正是所需要的。一个人必须有自己的工作室，否则就永远是一个业余爱好者。”

‘Is that so? Yes. Of course, I should like you to share it with Winifred.’
'是这样吗？是的。当然，我希望你能与威妮弗雷德分享。

‘Thank you SO much.’
'太感谢了。'

Gudrun knew all these things already, but she must look shy and very grateful, as if overcome.
古德伦已经知道了所有这些事情，但她一定看起来很害羞，而且非常感激，仿佛被克服了。

‘Of course, what I should like best, would be if you could give up your work at the Grammar School, and just avail yourself of the studio, and work there—well, as much or as little as you liked—‘
“当然，我最希望的是，你可以放弃在文法学校的工作，直接利用工作室，在那里工作——好吧，随你喜欢，多做少做——”

He looked at Gudrun with dark, vacant eyes. She looked back at him as if full of gratitude. These phrases of a dying man were so complete and natural, coming like echoes through his dead mouth.
他用黑色、空洞的眼睛看着古德伦。她回头看着他，脸上充满了感激之情。一个垂死之人​​的这些话语是那么完整、自然，就像是从他死去的嘴里发出的回声。

‘And as to your earnings—you don’t mind taking from me what you have taken from the Education Committee, do you? I don’t want you to be a loser.’
“至于你的收入——你不介意从我这里拿走你从教育委员会拿走的东西，是吗？”我不想让你成为一个失败者。

‘Oh,’ said Gudrun, ‘if I can have the studio and work there, I can earn money enough, really I can.’
“哦，”古德伦说，“如果我能拥有工作室并在那里工作，我就可以赚到足够的钱，真的可以。”

‘Well,’ he said, pleased to be the benefactor, ‘we can see about all that. You wouldn’t mind spending your days here?’
“好吧，”他很高兴成为捐助者，“我们可以看到这一切。”你不介意在这里度过几天吧？

‘If there were a studio to work in,’ said Gudrun, ‘I could ask for nothing better.’
“如果有一个工作室可以工作，”古德伦说，“我没有比这更好的了。”

‘Is that so?’
'是这样吗？'

He was really very pleased. But already he was getting tired. She could see the grey, awful semi-consciousness of mere pain and dissolution coming over him again, the torture coming into the vacancy of his darkened eyes. It was not over yet, this process of death. She rose softly saying:
他真的非常非常高兴。但他已经累了。她可以看到他再次陷入了灰色的、可怕的、半意识的痛苦和溶解状态，痛苦进入了他漆黑的眼睛的空虚之中。这个死亡的过程还没有结束。她起身轻声说道：

‘Perhaps you will sleep. I must look for Winifred.’
‘也许你会睡觉。我必须寻找威妮弗雷德。

She went out, telling the nurse that she had left him. Day by day the tissue of the sick man was further and further reduced, nearer and nearer the process came, towards the last knot which held the human being in its unity. But this knot was hard and unrelaxed, the will of the dying man never gave way. He might be dead in nine-tenths, yet the remaining tenth remained unchanged, till it too was torn apart. With his will he held the unit of himself firm, but the circle of his power was ever and ever reduced, it would be reduced to a point at last, then swept away.
她出去了，告诉护士她离开了他。日复一日，病人的组织越来越缩小，这个过程越来越接近将人类统一起来的最后一个结。但这个结是坚硬的，没有松开的，垂死之人的意志从未屈服。他可能死了十分之九，但剩下的十分之一却保持不变，直到也被撕裂。他用自己的意志牢牢地维持着自己的整体，但他的力量圈却在不断缩小，最后会缩小到一个点，然后被扫走。

To adhere to life, he must adhere to human relationships, and he caught at every straw. Winifred, the butler, the nurse, Gudrun, these were the people who meant all to him, in these last resources. Gerald, in his father’s presence, stiffened with repulsion. It was so, to a less degree, with all the other children except Winifred. They could not see anything but the death, when they looked at their father. It was as if some subterranean dislike overcame them. They could not see the familiar face, hear the familiar voice. They were overwhelmed by the antipathy of visible and audible death. Gerald could not breathe in his father’s presence. He must get out at once. And so, in the same way, the father could not bear the presence of his son. It sent a final irritation through the soul of the dying man.
要坚持生活，就必须坚持人际关系，他抓住了每一根稻草。威妮弗莱德、管家、护士、古德伦，在最后的资源中，这些人对他来说意味着一切。杰拉尔德在他父亲面前，因厌恶而僵住了。除威妮弗雷德外，其他所有孩子都是如此，但程度较轻。当他们看着父亲时，除了死亡，他们什么也看不见。就好像某种潜在的厌恶情绪战胜了他们。他们看不到熟悉的面孔，听不到熟悉的声音。他们对看得见、听得见的死亡感到厌恶。杰拉尔德在父亲面前无法呼吸。他必须立刻出去。同样，父亲也无法忍受儿子的存在。它给垂死之人的灵魂带来了最后的刺激。

The studio was made ready, Gudrun and Winifred moved in. They enjoyed so much the ordering and the appointing of it. And now they need hardly be in the house at all. They had their meals in the studio, they lived there safely. For the house was becoming dreadful. There were two nurses in white, flitting silently about, like heralds of death. The father was confined to his bed, there was a come and go of SOTTO-VOCE sisters and brothers and children.
工作室已经准备好，古德伦和威妮弗雷德搬了进去。他们非常喜欢它的订购和任命。现在他们几乎不需要呆在房子里了。他们在工作室吃饭，安全地住在那里。因为房子变得很可怕。两名身穿白衣的护士静静地走来走去，就像死亡的使者。父亲躺在床上，姐妹、兄弟和孩子们来来往往。

Winifred was her father’s constant visitor. Every morning, after breakfast, she went into his room when he was washed and propped up in bed, to spend half an hour with him.
威妮弗雷德是她父亲的常客。每天早上，吃完早餐后，她就走进他的房间，等他洗漱完毕，躺在床上，陪他半个小时。

‘Are you better, Daddie?’ she asked him invariably.
“你好点了吗，爸爸？”她总是问他。

And invariably he answered:
他总是回答：

‘Yes, I think I’m a little better, pet.’
“是的，我想我好一点了，宠物。”

She held his hand in both her own, lovingly and protectively. And this was very dear to him.
她用自己的双手握住他的手，充满爱意和保护。这对他来说非常珍贵。

She ran in again as a rule at lunch time, to tell him the course of events, and every evening, when the curtains were drawn, and his room was cosy, she spent a long time with him. Gudrun was gone home, Winifred was alone in the house: she liked best to be with her father. They talked and prattled at random, he always as if he were well, just the same as when he was going about. So that Winifred, with a child’s subtle instinct for avoiding the painful things, behaved as if nothing serious was the matter. Instinctively, she withheld her attention, and was happy. Yet in her remoter soul, she knew as well as the adults knew: perhaps better.
她通常在午餐时间再次跑进来，告诉他事情的经过，每天晚上，当窗帘拉上，他的房间变得舒适时，她会和他一起度过很长时间。古德伦回家了，威妮弗雷德独自一人在家里：她最喜欢和父亲在一起。他们随意地交谈着，闲聊着，他总是一副很好的样子，就像他出去时一样。因此，温妮弗雷德带着孩子回避痛苦事物的微妙本能，表现得好像没什么大不了的事情一样。她本能地收回了注意力，心里很高兴。然而，在她遥远的灵魂里，她和大人们一样清楚：也许更好。

Her father was quite well in his make-belief with her. But when she went away, he relapsed under the misery of his dissolution. But still there were these bright moments, though as his strength waned, his faculty for attention grew weaker, and the nurse had to send Winifred away, to save him from exhaustion.
她父亲对她的态度非常好。但当她离开后，他又在解体的痛苦中旧病复发。但仍然有这些美好的时刻，尽管随着他的体力减弱，他的注意力也越来越弱，护士不得不把威妮弗雷德送走，以免他精疲力竭。

He never admitted that he was going to die. He knew it was so, he knew it was the end. Yet even to himself he did not admit it. He hated the fact, mortally. His will was rigid. He could not bear being overcome by death. For him, there was no death. And yet, at times, he felt a great need to cry out and to wail and complain. He would have liked to cry aloud to Gerald, so that his son should be horrified out of his composure. Gerald was instinctively aware of this, and he recoiled, to avoid any such thing. This uncleanness of death repelled him too much. One should die quickly, like the Romans, one should be master of one’s fate in dying as in living. He was convulsed in the clasp of this death of his father’s, as in the coils of the great serpent of Laocoon. The great serpent had got the father, and the son was dragged into the embrace of horrifying death along with him. He resisted always. And in some strange way, he was a tower of strength to his father.
他从来不承认自己快要死了。他知道事情就是这样，他知道这就是结局。但连他自己也不承认。他讨厌这个事实，恨之入骨。他的意志是坚定的。他无法忍受死亡的折磨。对他来说，没有死亡。然而，有时，他觉得非常需要哭泣、哭泣和抱怨。他真想对杰拉德大声哭喊，这样他的儿子就会吓得魂不附体。杰拉尔德本能地意识到了这一点，他退缩了，避免发生这样的事情。这种死亡的不洁让他太厌恶了。一个人应该像罗马人一样快点死去，无论是生还是死，都应该成为自己命运的主宰。他在父亲的死亡的紧握中抽搐，就像在拉奥孔巨蛇的盘绕中一样。大蛇抓住了父亲，儿子也随之被拖入可怕的死亡怀抱。他一直在反抗。以某种奇怪的方式，他是他父亲的力量之塔。

The last time the dying man asked to see Gudrun he was grey with near death. Yet he must see someone, he must, in the intervals of consciousness, catch into connection with the living world, lest he should have to accept his own situation. Fortunately he was most of his time dazed and half gone. And he spent many hours dimly thinking of the past, as it were, dimly re-living his old experiences. But there were times even to the end when he was capable of realising what was happening to him in the present, the death that was on him. And these were the times when he called in outside help, no matter whose. For to realise this death that he was dying was a death beyond death, never to be borne. It was an admission never to be made.
上次那个垂死的人要求见古德伦时，他脸色苍白，濒临死亡。然而他必须见到某个人，他必须在意识的间隙与生活世界建立联系，以免他不得不接受自己的处境。幸运的是，他大部分时间都处于茫然状态，神志不清。他花了很多时间模模糊糊地思考过去，可以说，模模糊糊地重温了他以前的经历。但有时，直到生命的最后一刻，他仍然能够意识到现在发生在他身上的事情，死亡即将来临。在这些时候，他需要寻求外部帮助，无论是谁。因为认识到他正在死去的死亡是一种超越死亡的死亡，永远无法承受。这是一个永远无法承认的事实。

Gudrun was shocked by his appearance, and by the darkened, almost disintegrated eyes, that still were unconquered and firm.
古德伦对他的外表感到震惊，对他那双漆黑、几乎崩溃的眼睛感到震惊，但那双眼睛仍然不屈不挠、坚定。

‘Well,’ he said in his weakened voice, ‘and how are you and Winifred getting on?’
“好吧，”他用微弱的声音说道，“你和威妮弗雷德相处得怎么样？”

‘Oh, very well indeed,’ replied Gudrun.
“哦，确实很好，”古德伦回答道。

There were slight dead gaps in the conversation, as if the ideas called up were only elusive straws floating on the dark chaos of the sick man’s dying.
谈话中有轻微的死角，仿佛所提出的想法只是漂浮在病人垂死的黑暗混乱中的难以捉摸的稻草。

‘The studio answers all right?’ he said.
“工作室回答可以吗？”他说。

‘Splendid. It couldn’t be more beautiful and perfect,’ said Gudrun.
'灿烂。它再美丽不过了，”古德伦说。

She waited for what he would say next.
她等着他接下来说的话。

‘And you think Winifred has the makings of a sculptor?’
“你认为威妮弗雷德具备雕塑家的素质吗？”

It was strange how hollow the words were, meaningless.
奇怪的是，这些话是如此空洞，毫无意义。

‘I’m sure she has. She will do good things one day.’
“我确信她有。有一天她会做好事的。”

‘Ah! Then her life won’t be altogether wasted, you think?’
'啊！那么她的生命就不会完全被浪费了，你觉得吗？

Gudrun was rather surprised.
古德伦颇为惊讶。

‘Sure it won’t!’ she exclaimed softly.
“当然不会！”她轻声喊道。

‘That’s right.’
'这是正确的。'

Again Gudrun waited for what he would say.
古德伦再次等待他说的话。

‘You find life pleasant, it is good to live, isn’t it?’ he asked, with a pitiful faint smile that was almost too much for Gudrun.
“你觉得生活很愉快，活着真好，不是吗？”他问道，脸上带着一丝可怜的微笑，这对古德伦来说几乎是难以忍受的。

‘Yes,’ she smiled—she would lie at random—‘I get a pretty good time I believe.’
“是的，”她微笑着——她会随意撒谎——“我相信我度过了一段愉快的时光。”

‘That’s right. A happy nature is a great asset.’
'这是正确的。快乐的天性是一笔巨大的财富。”

Again Gudrun smiled, though her soul was dry with repulsion. Did one have to die like this—having the life extracted forcibly from one, whilst one smiled and made conversation to the end? Was there no other way? Must one go through all the horror of this victory over death, the triumph of the integral will, that would not be broken till it disappeared utterly? One must, it was the only way. She admired the self-possession and the control of the dying man exceedingly. But she loathed the death itself. She was glad the everyday world held good, and she need not recognise anything beyond.
古德伦再次微笑，尽管她的灵魂因厌恶而干涸。难道就得这样死吗——被强行夺走生命，而一个人却笑着说到底？难道就没有别的办法了吗？一个人是否必须经历这场战胜死亡的所有恐怖，这是整体意志的胜利，直到它完全消失才被打破？必须的，这是唯一的办法。她非常钦佩临终者的沉着和控制力。但她厌恶死亡本身。她很高兴日常生活的世界依然美好，她不需要认识任何超越的事物。

‘You are quite all right here?—nothing we can do for you?—nothing you find wrong in your position?’
“你在这儿还好吗？——我们无能为力？——你没发现你的处境有什么问题吗？”

‘Except that you are too good to me,’ said Gudrun.
“只是你对我太好了，”古德伦说。

‘Ah, well, the fault of that lies with yourself,’ he said, and he felt a little exultation, that he had made this speech.
“啊，好吧，这都是你自己的错，”他说，他为自己发表了这篇演讲感到有点欣喜。

He was still so strong and living! But the nausea of death began to creep back on him, in reaction.
他还是那么坚强，那么有活力！但作为反应，死亡的恶心感开始再次袭上心头。

Gudrun went away, back to Winifred. Mademoiselle had left, Gudrun stayed a good deal at Shortlands, and a tutor came in to carry on Winifred’s education. But he did not live in the house, he was connected with the Grammar School.
古德伦离开了，回到威妮弗雷德身边。小姐离开了，古德伦在肖特兰待了很长一段时间，一位家庭教师进来继续温妮弗雷德的教育。但他不住在房子里，他与文法学校有联系。

One day, Gudrun was to drive with Winifred and Gerald and Birkin to town, in the car. It was a dark, showery day. Winifred and Gudrun were ready and waiting at the door. Winifred was very quiet, but Gudrun had not noticed. Suddenly the child asked, in a voice of unconcern:
有一天，古德伦要与威妮弗雷德、杰拉尔德和伯金一起开车去镇上。那是一个阴暗、下雨的日子。威妮弗雷德和古德伦已经准备好了，正在门口等候。威妮弗雷德很安静，但古德伦没有注意到。突然，孩子用漫不经心的语气问道：

‘Do you think my father’s going to die, Miss Brangwen?’
“你认为我父亲会死吗，布兰文小姐？”

Gudrun started.
古德伦开始了。

‘I don’t know,’ she replied.
“我不知道，”她回答道。

‘Don’t you truly?’
“你真的不这么认为吗？”

‘Nobody knows for certain. He MAY die, of course.’
“没有人确切知道。当然，他可能会死。

The child pondered a few moments, then she asked:
孩子沉思了一会儿，问道：

‘But do you THINK he will die?’
“但是你认为他会死吗？”

It was put almost like a question in geography or science, insistent, as if she would force an admission from the adult. The watchful, slightly triumphant child was almost diabolical.
这几乎就像地理或科学问题一样，坚持不懈，仿佛她会强迫成年人承认。这个警惕的、略显得意的孩子几乎是恶魔。

‘Do I think he will die?’ repeated Gudrun. ‘Yes, I do.’
“我认为他会死吗？”古德伦重复道。 '是的，我愿意。'

But Winifred’s large eyes were fixed on her, and the girl did not move.
但威妮弗雷德的大眼睛死死地盯着她，女孩一动不动。

‘He is very ill,’ said Gudrun.
“他病得很重，”古德伦说。

A small smile came over Winifred’s face, subtle and sceptical.
威妮弗雷德的脸上浮现出一丝微笑，微妙而怀疑。

‘I don’t believe he will,’ the child asserted, mockingly, and she moved away into the drive. Gudrun watched the isolated figure, and her heart stood still. Winifred was playing with a little rivulet of water, absorbedly as if nothing had been said.
“我不相信他会这么做，”孩子嘲讽地说，然后她就走入了车道。戈珍看着那个孤立的身影，她的心停止了跳动。威妮弗雷德正在玩着一条小溪，全神贯注，好像什么也没说。

‘I’ve made a proper dam,’ she said, out of the moist distance.
“我已经建造了一座合适的水坝，”她在潮湿的远处说道。

Gerald came to the door from out of the hall behind.
杰拉尔德从后面的大厅来到门口。

‘It is just as well she doesn’t choose to believe it,’ he said.
“她不选择相信就好了，”他说。

Gudrun looked at him. Their eyes met; and they exchanged a sardonic understanding.
古德伦看着他。他们的目光相遇了；他们交换了一种讽刺的理解。

‘Just as well,’ said Gudrun.
“那也好，”古德伦说。

He looked at her again, and a fire flickered up in his eyes.
他再次看向她，眼中闪烁着火光。

‘Best to dance while Rome burns, since it must burn, don’t you think?’ he said.
“最好在罗马燃烧时跳舞，因为它一定会燃烧，你不觉得吗？”他说。

She was rather taken aback. But, gathering herself together, she replied:
她颇为吃惊。但是，她振作起来，回答道：

‘Oh—better dance than wail, certainly.’
“哦——当然，跳舞比哭泣更好。”

‘So I think.’
'所以我认为。'

And they both felt the subterranean desire to let go, to fling away everything, and lapse into a sheer unrestraint, brutal and licentious. A strange black passion surged up pure in Gudrun. She felt strong. She felt her hands so strong, as if she could tear the world asunder with them. She remembered the abandonments of Roman licence, and her heart grew hot. She knew she wanted this herself also—or something, something equivalent. Ah, if that which was unknown and suppressed in her were once let loose, what an orgiastic and satisfying event it would be. And she wanted it, she trembled slightly from the proximity of the man, who stood just behind her, suggestive of the same black licentiousness that rose in herself. She wanted it with him, this unacknowledged frenzy. For a moment the clear perception of this preoccupied her, distinct and perfect in its final reality. Then she shut it off completely, saying:
他们都感受到了内心深处想要放手的欲望，想要抛弃一切，陷入纯粹的放荡、野蛮和放荡之中。一种奇异的黑色激情在古珍身上纯粹地涌动起来。她感觉自己很坚强。她感觉自己的双手如此有力，仿佛可以将世界撕裂。她想起罗马执照被放弃的事，她的心变得火热。她知道她自己也想要这个——或者类似的东西。啊，如果她内心那股未知的、压抑的东西一旦释放出来，那将是多么的狂欢和满足啊。她想要它，她因为那个男人的靠近而微微颤抖，这个男人就站在她身后，暗示着她内心升起的同样的黑色放荡。她想要和他在一起，这种不被承认的疯狂。一时间，她对这一点的清晰感知全神贯注，最终的现实清晰而完美。然后她完全关闭了它，说道：

‘We might as well go down to the lodge after Winifred—we can get in the care there.’
“我们不妨跟着威妮弗雷德去小屋——我们可以在那里接受护理。”

‘So we can,’ he answered, going with her.
“所以我们可以，”他回答道，并和她一起走。

They found Winifred at the lodge admiring the litter of purebred white puppies. The girl looked up, and there was a rather ugly, unseeing cast in her eyes as she turned to Gerald and Gudrun. She did not want to see them.
他们在小屋里发现威妮弗雷德正在欣赏一窝纯种白色小狗。女孩抬起头，转向杰拉尔德和古德伦，眼中闪现出一种相当丑陋、看不见的神色。她不想看到他们。

‘Look!’ she cried. ‘Three new puppies! Marshall says this one seems perfect. Isn’t it a sweetling? But it isn’t so nice as its mother.’ She turned to caress the fine white bull-terrier bitch that stood uneasily near her.
“看！”她喊道。 “三只新小狗！马歇尔说这看起来很完美。不是甜甜的吗？但它不像它的母亲那么好。”她转身抚摸那只不安地站在她身边的漂亮的白色斗牛犬母狗。

‘My dearest Lady Crich,’ she said, ‘you are beautiful as an angel on earth. Angel—angel—don’t you think she’s good enough and beautiful enough to go to heaven, Gudrun? They will be in heaven, won’t they—and ESPECIALLY my darling Lady Crich! Mrs Marshall, I say!’
“我最亲爱的克里奇女士，”她说，“你像人间天使一样美丽。天使——天使——你不认为她足够优秀、足够美丽，可以去天堂吗，古珍？他们会在天堂，不是吗——尤其是我亲爱的克里奇夫人！马歇尔夫人，我说！

‘Yes, Miss Winifred?’ said the woman, appearing at the door.
“什么事，温妮弗雷德小姐？”出现在门口的女人说道。

‘Oh do call this one Lady Winifred, if she turns out perfect, will you? Do tell Marshall to call it Lady Winifred.’
“哦，请称呼她为温妮弗雷德女士，如果她看起来很完美，可以吗？”请告诉马歇尔称其为威妮弗雷德夫人。

‘I’ll tell him—but I’m afraid that’s a gentleman puppy, Miss Winifred.’
“我会告诉他的——但恐怕那是一只绅士小狗，温妮弗雷德小姐。”

‘Oh NO!’ There was the sound of a car. ‘There’s Rupert!’ cried the child, and she ran to the gate.
“哦，不！”传来汽车的声音。 “鲁珀特来了！”孩子喊道，然后跑向大门。

Birkin, driving his car, pulled up outside the lodge gate.
伯金开着车，把车停在旅馆大门外。

‘We’re ready!’ cried Winifred. ‘I want to sit in front with you, Rupert. May I?’
“我们准备好了！”威妮弗雷德喊道。 “我想坐在你前面，鲁珀特。我可以？'

‘I’m afraid you’ll fidget about and fall out,’ he said.
“我担心你会坐立不安并摔倒，”他说。

‘No I won’t. I do want to sit in front next to you. It makes my feet so lovely and warm, from the engines.’
‘不，我不会。我确实想坐在你旁边。发动机让我的脚变得如此可爱和温暖。

Birkin helped her up, amused at sending Gerald to sit by Gudrun in the body of the car.
伯金扶起她，让杰拉尔德坐在车内古德伦旁边，这让伯金感到很有趣。

‘Have you any news, Rupert?’ Gerald called, as they rushed along the lanes.
“鲁珀特，你有什么消息吗？”当他们沿着小巷奔跑时，杰拉德喊道。

‘News?’ exclaimed Birkin.
“新闻？”伯金惊呼道。

‘Yes,’ Gerald looked at Gudrun, who sat by his side, and he said, his eyes narrowly laughing, ‘I want to know whether I ought to congratulate him, but I can’t get anything definite out of him.’
“是的，”杰拉德看着坐在他身边的古德伦，眼睛里带着笑意，说道，“我想知道我是否应该祝贺他，但我无法从他那里得到任何明确的信息。”

Gudrun flushed deeply.
古德伦的脸涨得通红。

‘Congratulate him on what?’ she asked.
“祝贺他什么？”她问道。

‘There was some mention of an engagement—at least, he said something to me about it.’
“有人提到了订婚——至少，他对我说了一些关于这件事的事情。”

Gudrun flushed darkly.
古德伦的脸涨得通红。

‘You mean with Ursula?’ she said, in challenge.
“你是说和乌苏拉在一起吗？”她挑衅地说。

‘Yes. That is so, isn’t it?’
'是的。是这样，不是吗？

‘I don’t think there’s any engagement,’ said Gudrun, coldly.
“我不认为有任何订婚，”古珍冷冷地说。

‘That so? Still no developments, Rupert?’ he called.
'这么？ “鲁珀特，还是没有进展吗？”他喊道。

‘Where? Matrimonial? No.’
'在哪里？婚姻？不。'

‘How’s that?’ called Gudrun.
“怎么样？”古德伦喊道。

Birkin glanced quickly round. There was irritation in his eyes also.
伯金迅速环顾四周。他的眼眸中也浮现出一丝刺激。

‘Why?’ he replied. ‘What do you think of it, Gudrun?’
“为什么？”他回答道。 “你觉得怎么样，古德伦？”

‘Oh,’ she cried, determined to fling her stone also into the pool, since they had begun, ‘I don’t think she wants an engagement. Naturally, she’s a bird that prefers the bush.’ Gudrun’s voice was clear and gong-like. It reminded Rupert of her father’s, so strong and vibrant.
“哦，”她喊道，决心把她的石头也扔进池子里，因为他们已经开始了，“我认为她不想订婚。”自然，她是一只喜欢灌木的鸟儿。”古珍的声音清脆如锣。这让鲁珀特想起了她父亲的父亲，他是如此坚强而充满活力。

‘And I,’ said Birkin, his face playful but yet determined, ‘I want a binding contract, and am not keen on love, particularly free love.’
“而我，”伯金说道，他的表情俏皮但又坚定，“我想要一份有约束力的合同，并且不热衷爱情，尤其是自由恋爱。”

They were both amused. WHY this public avowal? Gerald seemed suspended a moment, in amusement.
他们都被逗乐了。为什么要公开声明？杰拉尔德似乎被逗乐了一会儿。

‘Love isn’t good enough for you?’ he called.
“爱情对你来说还不够好吗？”他喊道。

‘No!’ shouted Birkin.
“不！”伯金喊道。

‘Ha, well that’s being over-refined,’ said Gerald, and the car ran through the mud.
“哈，好吧，那是过度精炼了，”杰拉德说，然后汽车就在泥泞中行驶了。

‘What’s the matter, really?’ said Gerald, turning to Gudrun.
“到底是怎么回事？”杰拉尔德转向古德伦问道。

This was an assumption of a sort of intimacy that irritated Gudrun almost like an affront. It seemed to her that Gerald was deliberately insulting her, and infringing on the decent privacy of them all.
这种对亲密关系的假设几乎像一种侮辱一样激怒了古德伦。在她看来，杰拉尔德是在故意侮辱她，侵犯了他们所有人的正当隐私。

‘What is it?’ she said, in her high, repellent voice. ‘Don’t ask me!—I know nothing about ULTIMATE marriage, I assure you: or even penultimate.’
“什么事？”她用高亢而令人厌恶的声音问道。 “别问我！——我向你保证，我对终极婚姻一无所知：甚至是倒数第二。”

‘Only the ordinary unwarrantable brand!’ replied Gerald. ‘Just so—same here. I am no expert on marriage, and degrees of ultimateness. It seems to be a bee that buzzes loudly in Rupert’s bonnet.’
“只是普通的无保证的品牌！”杰拉德回答道。 ‘就是这样——这里也一样。我不是婚姻和终极程度方面的专家。似乎是一只蜜蜂在鲁珀特的帽子里大声嗡嗡叫。

‘Exactly! But that is his trouble, exactly! Instead of wanting a woman for herself, he wants his IDEAS fulfilled. Which, when it comes to actual practice, is not good enough.’
'确切地！但这正是他的麻烦！他不想为自己找一个女人，而是希望他的想法得以实现。当涉及到实际实践时，这还不够好。

‘Oh no. Best go slap for what’s womanly in woman, like a bull at a gate.’ Then he seemed to glimmer in himself. ‘You think love is the ticket, do you?’ he asked.
'不好了。最好给女人的女人味打一巴掌，就像门口的公牛一样。”然后他似乎在自己身上闪闪发光。 “你认为爱情就是门票，是吗？”他问道。

‘Certainly, while it lasts—you only can’t insist on permanency,’ came Gudrun’s voice, strident above the noise.
“当然，虽然它会持续——但你不能坚持永久，”古德伦的声音传来，声音刺耳，盖过了噪音。

‘Marriage or no marriage, ultimate or penultimate or just so-so?—take the love as you find it.’
“结婚还是不结婚，最终还是倒数第二还是马马虎虎？——随心所欲地接受爱情。”

‘As you please, or as you don’t please,’ she echoed. ‘Marriage is a social arrangement, I take it, and has nothing to do with the question of love.’
“随你喜欢，或者随你不喜欢，”她重复道。 “我认为婚姻是一种社会安排，与爱情问题无关。”

His eyes were flickering on her all the time. She felt as is he were kissing her freely and malevolently. It made the colour burn in her cheeks, but her heart was quite firm and unfailing.
他的目光始终在她身上闪烁。她感觉他正在随意而恶毒地吻着她。这让她脸颊涨红，但她的心却十分坚定，不屈不挠。

‘You think Rupert is off his head a bit?’ Gerald asked.
“你觉得鲁珀特有点疯狂吗？”杰拉德问。

Her eyes flashed with acknowledgment.
她的眼睛里闪烁着认可的光芒。

‘As regards a woman, yes,’ she said, ‘I do. There IS such a thing as two people being in love for the whole of their lives—perhaps. But marriage is neither here nor there, even then. If they are in love, well and good. If not—why break eggs about it!’
“至于女人，是的，”她说，“我愿意。”或许有这样的事情，两个人一生相爱。但即便如此，婚姻也不存在。如果他们相爱，那就太好了。如果不是——为什么要打破鸡蛋呢！

‘Yes,’ said Gerald. ‘That’s how it strikes me. But what about Rupert?’
“是的，”杰拉德说。 ‘这就是我的印象。但鲁珀特呢？

‘I can’t make out—neither can he nor anybody. He seems to think that if you marry you can get through marriage into a third heaven, or something—all very vague.’
“我看不懂——他也看不懂，任何人也看不懂。”他似乎认为，如果你结婚了，你就可以通过婚姻进入第三层天堂，或者其他什么——这一切都很模糊。

‘Very! And who wants a third heaven? As a matter of fact, Rupert has a great yearning to be SAFE—to tie himself to the mast.’
'非常！谁想要第三层天呢？事实上，鲁珀特非常渴望安全——将自己绑在桅杆上。

‘Yes. It seems to me he’s mistaken there too,’ said Gudrun. ‘I’m sure a mistress is more likely to be faithful than a wife—just because she is her OWN mistress. No—he says he believes that a man and wife can go further than any other two beings—but WHERE, is not explained. They can know each other, heavenly and hellish, but particularly hellish, so perfectly that they go beyond heaven and hell—into—there it all breaks down—into nowhere.’
'是的。在我看来，他在这方面也犯了错误。”古德伦说道。 “我确信情妇比妻子更忠诚——仅仅因为她是自己的情妇。不，他说他相信男人和妻子可以比任何其他两个人走得更远，但没有解释在哪里。他们可以彼此了解，无论是天堂的还是地狱的，但特别是地狱般的，如此完美，以至于他们超越了天堂和地狱——进入——那里一切都崩溃了——无处可去。

‘Into Paradise, he says,’ laughed Gerald.
“进入天堂，他说，”杰拉德笑道。

Gudrun shrugged her shoulders. ‘FE M’EN FICHE of your Paradise!’ she said.
古珍耸耸肩。 “FE M’EN FICHE 你的天堂！”她说。

‘Not being a Mohammedan,’ said Gerald. Birkin sat motionless, driving the car, quite unconscious of what they said. And Gudrun, sitting immediately behind him, felt a sort of ironic pleasure in thus exposing him.
“不是伊斯兰教徒，”杰拉尔德说。伯金一动不动地坐着，开着车，完全没有意识到他们在说什么。古德伦就坐在他身后，因为这样暴露了他，他感到一种讽刺的快感。

‘He says,’ she added, with a grimace of irony, ‘that you can find an eternal equilibrium in marriage, if you accept the unison, and still leave yourself separate, don’t try to fuse.’
“他说，”她带着讽刺的表情补充道，“如果你接受和谐，但仍然保持分离，你就可以在婚姻中找到永恒的平衡，不要试图融合。”

‘Doesn’t inspire me,’ said Gerald.
“这并没有激励我，”杰拉德说。

‘That’s just it,’ said Gudrun.
“就是这样，”古德伦说。

‘I believe in love, in a real ABANDON, if you’re capable of it,’ said Gerald.
“我相信爱情，相信真正的抛弃，如果你有能力的话，”杰拉德说。

‘So do I,’ said she.
“我也是，”她说。

‘And so does Rupert, too—though he is always shouting.’
“鲁珀特也是如此——尽管他总是大喊大叫。”

‘No,’ said Gudrun. ‘He won’t abandon himself to the other person. You can’t be sure of him. That’s the trouble I think.’
“不，”古德伦说。 ‘他不会把自己交给另一个人。你不能确定他。我认为这就是麻烦所在。

‘Yet he wants marriage! Marriage—ET PUIS?’
‘可是他却想要结婚！婚姻——ET PUIS？

‘Le paradis!’ mocked Gudrun.
“天堂！”古德伦嘲笑道。

Birkin, as he drove, felt a creeping of the spine, as if somebody was threatening his neck. But he shrugged with indifference. It began to rain. Here was a change. He stopped the car and got down to put up the hood.
伯金开车时感到脊椎发麻，好像有人在威胁他的脖子。但他漠然地耸耸肩。开始下雨了。这是一个变化。他停下车，下车盖上引擎盖。

CHAPTER XXII
第二十二章

WOMAN TO WOMAN
女人对女人

They came to the town, and left Gerald at the railway station. Gudrun and Winifred were to come to tea with Birkin, who expected Ursula also. In the afternoon, however, the first person to turn up was Hermione. Birkin was out, so she went in the drawing-room, looking at his books and papers, and playing on the piano. Then Ursula arrived. She was surprised, unpleasantly so, to see Hermione, of whom she had heard nothing for some time.
他们来到镇上，把杰拉德留在火车站。古德伦和威妮弗雷德要和伯金一起喝茶，伯金预计乌苏拉也会来。然而下午，第一个出现的人是赫敏。伯金出去了，所以她走进客厅，看着他的书和论文，弹着钢琴。然后乌苏拉来了。她很惊讶，而且很不愉快地看到了赫敏，她已经有一段时间没有听到赫敏的消息了。

‘It is a surprise to see you,’ she said.
“见到你真是一个惊喜，”她说。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione—‘I’ve been away at Aix—‘
“是的，”赫敏说——“我去了艾克斯——”

‘Oh, for your health?’
“哦，为了你的健康？”

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

The two women looked at each other. Ursula resented Hermione’s long, grave, downward-looking face. There was something of the stupidity and the unenlightened self-esteem of a horse in it. ‘She’s got a horse-face,’ Ursula said to herself, ‘she runs between blinkers.’ It did seem as if Hermione, like the moon, had only one side to her penny. There was no obverse. She stared out all the time on the narrow, but to her, complete world of the extant consciousness. In the darkness, she did not exist. Like the moon, one half of her was lost to life. Her self was all in her head, she did not know what it was spontaneously to run or move, like a fish in the water, or a weasel on the grass. She must always KNOW.
两个女人互相看了一眼。乌苏拉讨厌赫敏那张长而严肃、低头的脸。其中有一些马的愚蠢和不开明的自尊心。 “她有一张马脸，”乌苏拉对自己说，“她在眼罩之间奔跑。”看起来赫敏确实像月亮一样，她的便士只有一面。没有正面。她一直凝视着狭隘但对她而言完整的现存意识世界。黑暗中，她并不存在。就像月亮一样，她的一半失去了生命。她的自我全在她的脑子里，她不知道什么是自发地奔跑或移动，如水中的鱼，或草地上的黄鼠狼。她必须永远知道。

But Ursula only suffered from Hermione’s one-sidedness. She only felt Hermione’s cool evidence, which seemed to put her down as nothing. Hermione, who brooded and brooded till she was exhausted with the ache of her effort at consciousness, spent and ashen in her body, who gained so slowly and with such effort her final and barren conclusions of knowledge, was apt, in the presence of other women, whom she thought simply female, to wear the conclusions of her bitter assurance like jewels which conferred on her an unquestionable distinction, established her in a higher order of life. She was apt, mentally, to condescend to women such as Ursula, whom she regarded as purely emotional. Poor Hermione, it was her one possession, this aching certainty of hers, it was her only justification. She must be confident here, for God knows, she felt rejected and deficient enough elsewhere. In the life of thought, of the spirit, she was one of the elect. And she wanted to be universal. But there was a devastating cynicism at the bottom of her. She did not believe in her own universals—they were sham. She did not believe in the inner life—it was a trick, not a reality. She did not believe in the spiritual world—it was an affectation. In the last resort, she believed in Mammon, the flesh, and the devil—these at least were not sham. She was a priestess without belief, without conviction, suckled in a creed outworn, and condemned to the reiteration of mysteries that were not divine to her. Yet there was no escape. She was a leaf upon a dying tree. What help was there then, but to fight still for the old, withered truths, to die for the old, outworn belief, to be a sacred and inviolate priestess of desecrated mysteries? The old great truths BAD been true. And she was a leaf of the old great tree of knowledge that was withering now. To the old and last truth then she must be faithful even though cynicism and mockery took place at the bottom of her soul.
但乌苏拉只是因为赫敏的片面而受苦。她只感受到了赫敏冷静的证据，这似乎让她显得微不足道。赫敏一直在沉思，直到她因意识努力的痛苦而筋疲力尽，她的身体变得苍白无力，她如此缓慢地、经过如此努力才获得了她最后的、贫瘠的知识结论，在其他人在场的情况下，她是很恰当的。她认为女性只是女性，将她苦涩的保证所得出的结论像佩戴珠宝一样佩戴，这赋予了她无可置疑的区别，使她享有更高的生活秩序。从精神上来说，她倾向于屈尊于乌苏拉这样的女性，她认为她们纯粹是情绪化的。可怜的赫敏，这是她唯一的财产，她的这种痛苦的确定性，这是她唯一的理由。她在这里一定很自信，因为上帝知道，她在其他地方感到被拒绝和缺乏。在思想和精神生活中，她是选民之一。她想变得普遍。但她的内心深处却有一种毁灭性的愤世嫉俗。她不相信自己的共性——它们是假的。她不相信内心世界——那是一个骗局，而不是现实。她不相信精神世界——那是一种矫揉造作。归根结底，她相信玛门，相信肉体，相信魔鬼，这些至少不是假的。她是一位没有信仰、没有信念的女祭司，灌输着一种过时的信条，并注定要重复那些对她来说并不神圣的神秘事物。然而却无处可逃。她是一棵垂死之树上的一片叶子。除了继续为古老的、枯萎的真理而奋斗，为古老的、过时的信仰而死，成为被亵渎的神秘事物的神圣不可侵犯的女祭司之外，还有什么帮助呢？古老的伟大真理并不是真的。 她是那棵正在枯萎的古老知识之树上的一片叶子。那么，即使她的灵魂深处充满了愤世嫉俗和嘲笑，她也必须忠于古老而最后的真理。

‘I am so glad to see you,’ she said to Ursula, in her slow voice, that was like an incantation. ‘You and Rupert have become quite friends?’
“我很高兴见到你，”她对乌苏拉说道，声音缓慢，就像咒语一样。 “你和鲁珀特已经成为很好的朋友了？”

‘Oh yes,’ said Ursula. ‘He is always somewhere in the background.’
“哦，是的，”乌苏拉说。 “他总是在幕后的某个地方。”

Hermione paused before she answered. She saw perfectly well the other woman’s vaunt: it seemed truly vulgar.
赫敏在回答之前停顿了一下。她清楚地看到另一个女人的吹嘘：看起来确实很粗俗。

‘Is he?’ she said slowly, and with perfect equanimity. ‘And do you think you will marry?’
“是吗？”她缓慢而平静地说。 “你觉得你会结婚吗？”

The question was so calm and mild, so simple and bare and dispassionate that Ursula was somewhat taken aback, rather attracted. It pleased her almost like a wickedness. There was some delightful naked irony in Hermione.
这个问题如此平静、温和，如此简单、赤裸裸、冷静，让乌苏拉有些吃惊，甚至有点被吸引。这几乎像邪恶一样让她高兴。赫敏身上有一些令人愉快的赤裸裸的讽刺。

‘Well,’ replied Ursula, ‘HE wants to, awfully, but I’m not so sure.’
“好吧，”乌苏拉回答道，“他非常想这么做，但我不太确定。”

Hermione watched her with slow calm eyes. She noted this new expression of vaunting. How she envied Ursula a certain unconscious positivity! even her vulgarity!
赫敏用平静的眼睛看着她。她注意到了这种新的炫耀表情。她多么羡慕乌苏拉某种无意识的积极性！甚至她的粗俗！

‘Why aren’t you sure?’ she asked, in her easy sing song. She was perfectly at her ease, perhaps even rather happy in this conversation. ‘You don’t really love him?’
“你为什么不确定？”她用轻松的歌声问道。她在这次谈话中感到非常轻松，甚至可能相当高兴。 “你其实并不爱他？”

Ursula flushed a little at the mild impertinence of this question. And yet she could not definitely take offence. Hermione seemed so calmly and sanely candid. After all, it was rather great to be able to be so sane.
乌苏拉因为这个有点无礼的问题而脸红了。但她又不能绝对生气。赫敏看上去如此冷静、理智、坦诚。毕竟，能够保持这样的理智，已经是太好了。

‘He says it isn’t love he wants,’ she replied.
“他说他想要的不是爱，”她回答道。

‘What is it then?’ Hermione was slow and level.
“那是什么？”赫敏语气缓慢而平静。

‘He wants me really to accept him in marriage.’
“他希望我真的接受他的婚姻。”

Hermione was silent for some time, watching Ursula with slow, pensive eyes.
赫敏沉默了一会儿，用沉思的眼神缓慢地看着乌苏拉。

‘Does he?’ she said at length, without expression. Then, rousing, ‘And what is it you don’t want? You don’t want marriage?’
“是吗？”她面无表情地最后问道。然后，他激动地说：“那你不想要什么？”你不想结婚吗？

‘No—I don’t—not really. I don’t want to give the sort of SUBMISSION he insists on. He wants me to give myself up—and I simply don’t feel that I CAN do it.’
“不——我不——真的不。我不想给予他所坚持的那种服从。他要我自首——而我就是觉得自己做不到。”

Again there was a long pause, before Hermione replied:
又是一阵长时间的停顿，赫敏才回答道：

‘Not if you don’t want to.’ Then again there was silence. Hermione shuddered with a strange desire. Ah, if only he had asked HER to subserve him, to be his slave! She shuddered with desire.
“如果你不想的话就不要。”然后又是一片沉默。赫敏因一种奇怪的欲望而颤抖。啊，如果他要求她侍奉他，成为他的奴隶就好了！她因欲望而颤抖。

‘You see I can’t—‘
“你看我不能——”

‘But exactly in what does—‘
“但到底是什么——”

They had both begun at once, they both stopped. Then, Hermione, assuming priority of speech, resumed as if wearily:
他们同时开始，又同时停了下来。然后，赫敏占据了发言的优先权，仿佛疲倦地继续说道：

‘To what does he want you to submit?’
“他希望你服从什么？”

‘He says he wants me to accept him non-emotionally, and finally—I really don’t know what he means. He says he wants the demon part of himself to be mated—physically—not the human being. You see he says one thing one day, and another the next—and he always contradicts himself—‘
“他说他希望我非情感地接受他，最后——我真的不知道他的意思。他说他希望自己的恶魔部分能够在肉体上交配，而不是与人类交配。你看他一天说一件事，第二天又说另一件事——而且他总是自相矛盾——”

‘And always thinks about himself, and his own dissatisfaction,’ said Hermione slowly.
“并且总是想着他自己，以及他自己的不满，”赫敏慢慢地说。

‘Yes,’ cried Ursula. ‘As if there were no-one but himself concerned. That makes it so impossible.’
“是的，”乌苏拉喊道。 ‘好像除了他自己之外没有人关心。这使得它变得不可能。

But immediately she began to retract.
但她立刻开始退缩。

‘He insists on my accepting God knows what in HIM,’ she resumed. ‘He wants me to accept HIM as—as an absolute—But it seems to me he doesn’t want to GIVE anything. He doesn’t want real warm intimacy—he won’t have it—he rejects it. He won’t let me think, really, and he won’t let me FEEL—he hates feelings.’
“他坚持要我接受天知道他身上有什么，”她继续说道。 “他希望我接受他——作为绝对的——但在我看来，他不想给予任何东西。他不想要真正温暖的亲密关系——他不会拥有——他拒绝它。他不让我思考，真的，也不让我感受——他讨厌感受。

There was a long pause, bitter for Hermione. Ah, if only he would have made this demand of her? Her he DROVE into thought, drove inexorably into knowledge—and then execrated her for it.
赫敏停顿了很长一段时间，心里很痛苦。啊，如果他能向她提出这样的要求就好了？他将她带入思想，无情地带入知识——然后为此咒骂她。

‘He wants me to sink myself,’ Ursula resumed, ‘not to have any being of my own—‘
“他想让我沉下去，”乌苏拉继续说道，“不要有任何自己的存在——”

‘Then why doesn’t he marry an odalisk?’ said Hermione in her mild sing-song, ‘if it is that he wants.’ Her long face looked sardonic and amused.
“那他为什么不娶一位宫女呢？”赫敏用温和的歌声说道，“如果他愿意的话。”她的长脸显得讽刺又好笑。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula vaguely. After all, the tiresome thing was, he did not want an odalisk, he did not want a slave. Hermione would have been his slave—there was in her a horrible desire to prostrate herself before a man—a man who worshipped her, however, and admitted her as the supreme thing. He did not want an odalisk. He wanted a woman to TAKE something from him, to give herself up so much that she could take the last realities of him, the last facts, the last physical facts, physical and unbearable.
“是的，”乌苏拉含糊地说。毕竟，烦人的是，他不要宫女，他不要奴隶。赫敏会成为他的奴隶——她内心有一种可怕的欲望，想要在一个男人面前屈服——然而，这个男人崇拜她，承认她是至高无上的。他不想要宫女。他想要一个女人从他身上夺走一些东西，完全放弃自己，以便她能够接受他最后的现实，最后的事实，最后的身体事实，身体上的和难以忍受的。

And if she did, would he acknowledge her? Would he be able to acknowledge her through everything, or would he use her just as his instrument, use her for his own private satisfaction, not admitting her? That was what the other men had done. They had wanted their own show, and they would not admit her, they turned all she was into nothingness. Just as Hermione now betrayed herself as a woman. Hermione was like a man, she believed only in men’s things. She betrayed the woman in herself. And Birkin, would he acknowledge, or would he deny her?
如果她这样做了，他会承认她吗？他能通过一切承认她，还是只是将她当作他的工具，利用她来满足自己的私人满足，而不承认她？这就是其他人所做的。他们想要自己的表演，他们不承认她，他们把她的一切都化为虚无。就像赫敏现在背叛了自己作为一个女人一样。赫敏就像一个男人，她只相信男人的事情。她背叛了自己内心的女人。而伯金，他会承认她，还是会否认她？

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, as each woman came out of her own separate reverie. ‘It would be a mistake—I think it would be a mistake—‘
“是的，”赫敏说，每个女人都从各自的遐想中走出来。 “这将是一个错误——我认为这将是一个错误——”

‘To marry him?’ asked Ursula.
“嫁给他？”乌苏拉问。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione slowly—‘I think you need a man—soldierly, strong-willed—‘ Hermione held out her hand and clenched it with rhapsodic intensity. ‘You should have a man like the old heroes—you need to stand behind him as he goes into battle, you need to SEE his strength, and to HEAR his shout—. You need a man physically strong, and virile in his will, NOT a sensitive man—.’ There was a break, as if the pythoness had uttered the oracle, and now the woman went on, in a rhapsody-wearied voice: ‘And you see, Rupert isn’t this, he isn’t. He is frail in health and body, he needs great, great care. Then he is so changeable and unsure of himself—it requires the greatest patience and understanding to help him. And I don’t think you are patient. You would have to be prepared to suffer—dreadfully. I can’t TELL you how much suffering it would take to make him happy. He lives an INTENSELY spiritual life, at times—too, too wonderful. And then come the reactions. I can’t speak of what I have been through with him. We have been together so long, I really do know him, I DO know what he is. And I feel I must say it; I feel it would be perfectly DISASTROUS for you to marry him—for you even more than for him.’ Hermione lapsed into bitter reverie. ‘He is so uncertain, so unstable—he wearies, and then reacts. I couldn’t TELL you what his re-actions are. I couldn’t TELL you the agony of them. That which he affirms and loves one day—a little latter he turns on it in a fury of destruction. He is never constant, always this awful, dreadful reaction. Always the quick change from good to bad, bad to good. And nothing is so devastating, nothing—‘
“是的，”赫敏慢慢地说——“我想你需要一个男人——有军人气概、意志坚强——”赫敏伸出手，狂喜地握紧了它。 ‘你应该有一个像古代英雄那样的人——当他上战场时，你需要站在他身后，你需要看到他的力量，并听到他的呼喊——。你需要一个身体强壮、意志坚强的男人，而不是一个敏感的男人——”有一个停顿，仿佛女蟒已经说出了神谕，现在女人用一种狂想曲疲倦的声音继续说道：“然后你看，鲁珀特不是这个，他不是。他的健康和身体都很虚弱，他需要非常非常多的照顾。然后他就变得如此多变且缺乏自信——需要最大的耐心和理解来帮助他。而且我认为你没有耐心。你必须准备好承受痛苦——可怕的痛苦。我无法告诉你要经历多少痛苦才能让他幸福。有时，他过着一种强烈的精神生活——也太美妙了。然后就是反应。我无法讲述我和他经历过的事情。我们在一起这么久了，我真的很了解他，我确实知道他是什么。我觉得我必须这么说；我觉得嫁给他对你来说绝对是一场灾难——对你来说甚至比对他来说更是如此。”赫敏陷入了痛苦的沉思。 “他如此不确定，如此不稳定——他感到疲倦，然后做出反应。我无法告诉你他的反应是什么。我无法告诉你他们的痛苦。某一天他肯定并热爱的东西——过了一会儿，他就以一种毁灭性的愤怒将它变成了现实。他从来都不是一成不变的，总是这种可怕的、可怕的反应。总是从好到坏，从坏到好的快速变化。没有什么比这更具有毁灭性，没有什么——”

‘Yes,’ said Ursula humbly, ‘you must have suffered.’
“是的，”乌苏拉谦虚地说，“你一定很痛苦。”

An unearthly light came on Hermione’s face. She clenched her hand like one inspired.
赫敏的脸上闪现出一种奇异的光芒。她像受到启发一样握紧了手。

‘And one must be willing to suffer—willing to suffer for him hourly, daily—if you are going to help him, if he is to keep true to anything at all—‘
“一个人必须愿意受苦——愿意为他每小时、每天受苦——如果你要帮助他，如果他要忠于任何事情——”

‘And I don’t WANT to suffer hourly and daily,’ said Ursula. ‘I don’t, I should be ashamed. I think it is degrading not to be happy.’
“我不想每小时、每天都受苦，”乌苏拉说。 ‘我不，我应该感到羞耻。我认为不快乐是有辱人格的。

Hermione stopped and looked at her a long time.
赫敏停了下来，看着她良久。

‘Do you?’ she said at last. And this utterance seemed to her a mark of Ursula’s far distance from herself. For to Hermione suffering was the greatest reality, come what might. Yet she too had a creed of happiness.
“你是吗？”她最后说道。而这句话对她来说似乎是乌苏拉与自己疏远的标志。因为对赫敏来说，无论发生什么，痛苦都是最大的现实。但她也有幸福的信条。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘One SHOULD be happy—‘ But it was a matter of will.
“是的，”她说。 “一个人应该快乐——”但这是一个意志问题。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, listlessly now, ‘I can only feel that it would be disastrous, disastrous—at least, to marry in a hurry. Can’t you be together without marriage? Can’t you go away and live somewhere without marriage? I do feel that marriage would be fatal, for both of you. I think for you even more than for him—and I think of his health—‘
“是的，”赫敏无精打采地说，“我只能感觉到，匆忙结婚将是灾难性的，灾难性的——至少如此。”不结婚就不能在一起吗？不结婚就不能离开去别的地方住吗？我确实觉得婚姻对你们俩来说都是致命的。我为你想的比为他想的还要多——我还为他的健康着想——”

‘Of course,’ said Ursula, ‘I don’t care about marriage—it isn’t really important to me—it’s he who wants it.’
“当然，”乌苏拉说，“我并不关心婚姻——这对我来说并不重要——而是他想要它。”

‘It is his idea for the moment,’ said Hermione, with that weary finality, and a sort of SI JEUNESSE SAVAIT infallibility.
“这是他目前的想法，”赫敏说道，语气里带着疲惫的决断，带着一种《SI JEUNESSE SAVAIT》的绝对正确性。

There was a pause. Then Ursula broke into faltering challenge.
一阵停顿。然后乌苏拉开始了摇摇欲坠的挑战。

‘You think I’m merely a physical woman, don’t you?’
“你认为我只是一个肉体上的女人，不是吗？”

‘No indeed,’ said Hermione. ‘No, indeed! But I think you are vital and young—it isn’t a question of years, or even of experience—it is almost a question of race. Rupert is race-old, he comes of an old race—and you seem to me so young, you come of a young, inexperienced race.’
“确实不，”赫敏说。 ‘不，确实如此！但我认为你充满活力而且年轻——这不是年龄的问题，甚至不是经验的问题——这几乎是一个种族的问题。鲁珀特是一个古老的种族，他来自一个古老的种族——而你在我看来很年轻，你来自一个年轻的、缺乏经验的种族。

‘Do I!’ said Ursula. ‘But I think he is awfully young, on one side.’
“我愿意！”乌苏拉说。 “但我认为他一方面非常年轻。”

‘Yes, perhaps childish in many respects. Nevertheless—‘
“是的，也许在很多方面都很幼稚。尽管如此-'

They both lapsed into silence. Ursula was filled with deep resentment and a touch of hopelessness. ‘It isn’t true,’ she said to herself, silently addressing her adversary. ‘It isn’t true. And it is YOU who want a physically strong, bullying man, not I. It is you who want an unsensitive man, not I. You DON’T know anything about Rupert, not really, in spite of the years you have had with him. You don’t give him a woman’s love, you give him an ideal love, and that is why he reacts away from you. You don’t know. You only know the dead things. Any kitchen maid would know something about him, you don’t know. What do you think your knowledge is but dead understanding, that doesn’t mean a thing. You are so false, and untrue, how could you know anything? What is the good of your talking about love—you untrue spectre of a woman! How can you know anything, when you don’t believe? You don’t believe in yourself and your own womanhood, so what good is your conceited, shallow cleverness—!’
两人都陷入了沉默。乌苏拉心中充满了深深的怨恨和一丝绝望。 “这不是真的，”她对自己说，默默地对她的对手说。 ‘这不是真的。是你想要一个身体强壮、欺负人的男人，而不是我。是你想要一个麻木不仁的男人，而不是我。你对鲁珀特一无所知，不是真的，尽管你和他相处了很多年。你给他的不是女人的爱，而是理想的爱，这就是为什么他对你反应冷淡。你不知道。你只知道死的东西。任何一个厨房女仆都会对他有所了解，但你不知道。你以为你的知识只不过是死的理解，那没有任何意义。你这么虚伪，这么不真实，你怎么会知道？你谈论爱情有什么好处——你这个不真实的女人幽灵！当你不相信时，你怎么能知道任何事呢？你不相信自己，不相信自己的女人味，那么你的自负、浅薄的聪明有什么用——！

The two women sat on in antagonistic silence. Hermione felt injured, that all her good intention, all her offering, only left the other woman in vulgar antagonism. But then, Ursula could not understand, never would understand, could never be more than the usual jealous and unreasonable female, with a good deal of powerful female emotion, female attraction, and a fair amount of female understanding, but no mind. Hermione had decided long ago that where there was no mind, it was useless to appeal for reason—one had merely to ignore the ignorant. And Rupert—he had now reacted towards the strongly female, healthy, selfish woman—it was his reaction for the time being—there was no helping it all. It was all a foolish backward and forward, a violent oscillation that would at length be too violent for his coherency, and he would smash and be dead. There was no saving him. This violent and directionless reaction between animalism and spiritual truth would go on in him till he tore himself in two between the opposite directions, and disappeared meaninglessly out of life. It was no good—he too was without unity, without MIND, in the ultimate stages of living; not quite man enough to make a destiny for a woman.
两个女人以敌对的沉默坐着。赫敏感到受伤，她所有的善意、所有的付出，只让另一个女人陷入粗俗的敌意。但那时，乌苏拉无法理解，永远不会理解，永远不可能比通常的嫉妒和不讲理的女性更多，拥有大量强大的女性情感，女性吸引力，以及相当多的女性理解力，但没有头脑。赫敏很久以前就认定，在没有头脑的地方，诉诸理性是没有用的——人们只能忽视无知的人。而鲁珀特——他现在对这个坚强的女性、健康、自私的女人的反应——这是他暂时的反应——这一切都没有帮助。这一切都是愚蠢的前后移动，剧烈的摇摆，最终对他的连贯性来说太剧烈了，他会摔碎而死。没有办法拯救他。动物本性与灵性真理之间的这种猛烈而无方向的反应将在他身上持续下去，直到他把自己撕成两半，毫无意义地从生活中消失。这不好——他在生命的最后阶段也没有统一，没有思想；不够男人，不足以决定女人的命运。

They sat on till Birkin came in and found them together. He felt at once the antagonism in the atmosphere, something radical and insuperable, and he bit his lip. But he affected a bluff manner.
他们一直坐着，直到伯金进来，发现他们在一起。他立刻感受到了气氛中的敌对情绪，一种激进而难以克服的情绪，他咬住了嘴唇。但他装出一副虚张声势的样子。

‘Hello, Hermione, are you back again? How do you feel?’
“哈喽，赫敏，你又回来了吗？你感觉如何？'

‘Oh, better. And how are you—you don’t look well—‘
‘哦，好多了。你怎么样——你看起来不太好——”

‘Oh!—I believe Gudrun and Winnie Crich are coming in to tea. At least they said they were. We shall be a tea-party. What train did you come by, Ursula?’
“噢！——我相信古德伦和温妮·克里奇正在进来喝茶。至少他们是这么说的。我们将举办一场茶会。乌苏拉，你坐哪趟火车来的？

It was rather annoying to see him trying to placate both women at once. Both women watched him, Hermione with deep resentment and pity for him, Ursula very impatient. He was nervous and apparently in quite good spirits, chattering the conventional commonplaces. Ursula was amazed and indignant at the way he made small-talk; he was adept as any FAT in Christendom. She became quite stiff, she would not answer. It all seemed to her so false and so belittling. And still Gudrun did not appear.
看到他试图同时安抚两个女人真是令人恼火。两个女人都看着他，赫敏对他充满了深深的怨恨和怜悯，乌苏拉则很不耐烦。他很紧张，而且显然精神很好，喋喋不休地说着一些常见的老生常谈。乌苏拉对他闲聊的方式感到惊讶和愤怒。他和基督教世界的任何一位FAT一样熟练。她的表情变得很僵硬，没有回答。在她看来，这一切都是那么虚假、那么贬低。但古德伦仍然没有出现。

‘I think I shall go to Florence for the winter,’ said Hermione at length.
“我想我应该去佛罗伦萨过冬，”赫敏最后说道。

‘Will you?’ he answered. ‘But it is so cold there.’
“你愿意吗？”他回答道。 “但是那里太冷了。”

‘Yes, but I shall stay with Palestra. It is quite comfortable.’
“是的，但我会留在帕莱斯特拉。很舒服。

‘What takes you to Florence?’
“你为什么去佛罗伦萨？”

‘I don’t know,’ said Hermione slowly. Then she looked at him with her slow, heavy gaze. ‘Barnes is starting his school of aesthetics, and Olandese is going to give a set of discourses on the Italian national policy-’
“我不知道，”赫敏慢慢地说。然后她用缓慢而沉重的目光看着他。 “巴恩斯正在开办他的美学学校，奥兰德斯将就意大利国家政策发表一系列论述——”

‘Both rubbish,’ he said.
“都是垃圾，”他说。

‘No, I don’t think so,’ said Hermione.
“不，我不这么认为，”赫敏说。

‘Which do you admire, then?’
“那么你欣赏哪一个呢？”

‘I admire both. Barnes is a pioneer. And then I am interested in Italy, in her coming to national consciousness.’
'我都很钦佩两者。巴恩斯是一位先驱。然后我对意大利感兴趣，对她的民族意识感兴趣。

‘I wish she’d come to something different from national consciousness, then,’ said Birkin; ‘especially as it only means a sort of commercial-industrial consciousness. I hate Italy and her national rant. And I think Barnes is an amateur.’
“那么，我希望她能找到一些与民族意识不同的东西，”伯金说。 “尤其是因为它仅意味着一种商业工业意识。我讨厌意大利和她的民族咆哮。我认为巴恩斯是一个业余爱好者。”

Hermione was silent for some moments, in a state of hostility. But yet, she had got Birkin back again into her world! How subtle her influence was, she seemed to start his irritable attention into her direction exclusively, in one minute. He was her creature.
赫敏沉默了一会儿，一副敌对的样子。然而，她还是让 Birkin 再次回到了她的世界！她的影响是多么微妙，她似乎在一分钟之内就把他烦躁的注意力完全集中到了她的方向上。他是她的创造物。

‘No,’ she said, ‘you are wrong.’ Then a sort of tension came over her, she raised her face like the pythoness inspired with oracles, and went on, in rhapsodic manner: ‘Il Sandro mi scrive che ha accolto il piu grande entusiasmo, tutti i giovani, e fanciulle e ragazzi, sono tutti—‘ She went on in Italian, as if, in thinking of the Italians she thought in their language.
“不，”她说，“你错了。”然后一种紧张感笼罩了她，她像受到神谕启发的巨蟒一样抬起脸，然后以狂想曲的方式继续说道：“Il Sandro mi scrive che ha accolto il piu grande entusiasmo, tutti i giovani, e fanciulle e ragazzi, sono tutti——”她用意大利语继续说下去，仿佛在用意大利语思考意大利人。

He listened with a shade of distaste to her rhapsody, then he said:
他带着一丝厌恶地听着她的狂想曲，然后说道：

‘For all that, I don’t like it. Their nationalism is just industrialism—that and a shallow jealousy I detest so much.’
“尽管如此，我还是不喜欢这样。他们的民族主义就是工业主义——我非常厌恶这种工业主义和肤浅的嫉妒。

‘I think you are wrong—I think you are wrong—‘ said Hermione. ‘It seems to me purely spontaneous and beautiful, the modern Italian’s PASSION, for it is a passion, for Italy, L’Italia—‘
“我认为你错了——我认为你错了——”赫敏说。 “在我看来，这纯粹是自发而美丽的，现代意大利人的激情，因为它是对意大利的激情，L’Italia——”

‘Do you know Italy well?’ Ursula asked of Hermione. Hermione hated to be broken in upon in this manner. Yet she answered mildly:
“你很了解意大利吗？”乌苏拉问赫敏。赫敏讨厌被这样打扰。但她还是温和地回答：

‘Yes, pretty well. I spent several years of my girlhood there, with my mother. My mother died in Florence.’
是的，很好。我和母亲在那里度过了几年的少女时代。我的母亲在佛罗伦萨去世了。”

‘Oh.’
'哦。'

There was a pause, painful to Ursula and to Birkin. Hermione however seemed abstracted and calm. Birkin was white, his eyes glowed as if he were in a fever, he was far too over-wrought. How Ursula suffered in this tense atmosphere of strained wills! Her head seemed bound round by iron bands.
一阵停顿，对乌苏拉和伯金来说都是痛苦的。然而赫敏显得心不在焉且平静。伯金脸色苍白，眼睛闪闪发亮，仿佛发烧了，他太劳累了。乌苏拉在这种意志紧张的紧张气氛中承受了多么大的痛苦啊！她的头似乎被铁箍捆住了。

Birkin rang the bell for tea. They could not wait for Gudrun any longer. When the door was opened, the cat walked in.
伯金按响了茶水铃。他们不能再等待古德伦了。门一打开，猫就走了进来。

‘Micio! Micio!’ called Hermione, in her slow, deliberate sing-song. The young cat turned to look at her, then, with his slow and stately walk he advanced to her side.
‘米西奥！ “米西奥！”赫敏用她缓慢而从容的歌声喊道。小猫转头看了她一眼，然后迈着缓慢而威严的步伐走到了她的身边。

‘Vieni—vieni qua,’ Hermione was saying, in her strange caressive, protective voice, as if she were always the elder, the mother superior. ‘Vieni dire Buon’ Giorno alla zia. Mi ricorde, mi ricorde bene—non he vero, piccolo? E vero che mi ricordi? E vero?’ And slowly she rubbed his head, slowly and with ironic indifference.
“Vieni-vieni qua，”赫敏用她奇怪的、爱抚的、保护性的声音说，就好像她永远是长辈，母亲。 “Vieni dire Buon”Giorno alla zia。 Mi ricorde，mi ricorde bene——non he vero，短笛？ E vero che mi ricordi？是吗？”她慢慢地抚摸着他的头，动作缓慢而冷漠，颇具讽刺意味。

‘Does he understand Italian?’ said Ursula, who knew nothing of the language.
“他懂意大利语吗？”乌苏拉问道，她对意大利语一无所知。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione at length. ‘His mother was Italian. She was born in my waste-paper basket in Florence, on the morning of Rupert’s birthday. She was his birthday present.’
“是的，”赫敏最后说道。 “他的母亲是意大利人。鲁珀特生日那天早上，她出生在我在佛罗伦萨的废纸篓里。她是他的生日礼物。

Tea was brought in. Birkin poured out for them. It was strange how inviolable was the intimacy which existed between him and Hermione. Ursula felt that she was an outsider. The very tea-cups and the old silver was a bond between Hermione and Birkin. It seemed to belong to an old, past world which they had inhabited together, and in which Ursula was a foreigner. She was almost a parvenue in their old cultured milieu. Her convention was not their convention, their standards were not her standards. But theirs were established, they had the sanction and the grace of age. He and she together, Hermione and Birkin, were people of the same old tradition, the same withered deadening culture. And she, Ursula, was an intruder. So they always made her feel.
茶端了进来，伯金为他们倒了茶。奇怪的是，他和赫敏之间的亲密关系是多么不可侵犯。乌苏拉觉得自己是个局外人。茶杯和旧银器是赫敏和柏金之间的纽带。它似乎属于他们共同居住过的一个古老的、过去的世界，而乌苏拉在这个世界里是一个外国人。在他们古老的文化环境中，她几乎是一个暴发户。她的惯例不是他们的惯例，他们的标准也不是她的标准。但他们的地位已经确立，他们得到了年龄的认可和恩典。他和她，赫敏和伯金，都是有着同样古老传统、同样枯萎、死气沉沉文化的人。而她，乌苏拉，是一个入侵者。所以他们总是让她有这种感觉。

Hermione poured a little cream into a saucer. The simple way she assumed her rights in Birkin’s room maddened and discouraged Ursula. There was a fatality about it, as if it were bound to be. Hermione lifted the cat and put the cream before him. He planted his two paws on the edge of the table and bent his gracious young head to drink.
赫敏往碟子里倒了一点奶油。她在伯金房间里主张自己权利的简单方式让乌苏拉感到愤怒和沮丧。这有一种宿命感，仿佛这是必然的。赫敏举起猫，把奶油放在他面前。他把两只爪子放在桌沿上，低下他那优雅的年轻脑袋，开始喝酒。

‘Siccuro che capisce italiano,’ sang Hermione, ‘non l’avra dimenticato, la lingua della Mamma.’
“Siccuro che capisce italiano，”赫敏唱道，“non l'avra dimenticato，la lingua della Mamma。”

She lifted the cat’s head with her long, slow, white fingers, not letting him drink, holding him in her power. It was always the same, this joy in power she manifested, peculiarly in power over any male being. He blinked forbearingly, with a male, bored expression, licking his whiskers. Hermione laughed in her short, grunting fashion.
她用修长、缓慢、白皙的手指抬起猫的头，不让他喝水，用力握住他。她所表现出的这种权力的喜悦总是一样的，特别是在对任何男性存在的权力中。他忍耐地眨着眼睛，一脸男性无聊的表情，舔着胡须。赫敏以她那短促、咕哝的方式笑了起来。

‘Ecco, il bravo ragazzo, come e superbo, questo!’
“Ecco，il bravo ragazzo，来吧 e superbo，questo！”

She made a vivid picture, so calm and strange with the cat. She had a true static impressiveness, she was a social artist in some ways.
她描绘了一幅生动的画面，与猫的相处如此平静而陌生。她有一种真正的静态令人印象深刻，在某些方面她是一位社会艺术家。

The cat refused to look at her, indifferently avoided her fingers, and began to drink again, his nose down to the cream, perfectly balanced, as he lapped with his odd little click.
猫拒绝看她，冷漠地避开她的手指，然后又开始喝水，他的鼻子低到奶油上，完美地平衡，同时发出奇怪的小响声。

‘It’s bad for him, teaching him to eat at table,’ said Birkin.
“教他在餐桌上吃饭对他来说很糟糕，”伯金说。

‘Yes,’ said Hermione, easily assenting.
“是的，”赫敏轻松地答应了。

Then, looking down at the cat, she resumed her old, mocking, humorous sing-song.
然后，她低头看着那只猫，又开始唱那首古老的、嘲讽的、幽默的歌。

‘Ti imparano fare brutte cose, brutte cose—‘
“Ti imparano fare brutte cose，brutte cose——”

She lifted the Mino’s white chin on her forefinger, slowly. The young cat looked round with a supremely forbearing air, avoided seeing anything, withdrew his chin, and began to wash his face with his paw. Hermione grunted her laughter, pleased.
她用食指慢慢抬起米诺白皙的下巴。小猫以极其隐忍的神情环顾四周，避开任何东西，收回下巴，开始用爪子洗脸。赫敏高兴地发出咕哝的笑声。

‘Bel giovanotto—‘ she said.
“贝尔乔瓦诺托——”她说。

The cat reached forward again and put his fine white paw on the edge of the saucer. Hermione lifted it down with delicate slowness. This deliberate, delicate carefulness of movement reminded Ursula of Gudrun.
猫又向前伸出手，把它那细白的爪子放在碟子的边缘上。赫敏小心翼翼地缓慢地把它拿了下来。这种从容、微妙的动作让乌苏拉想起了古德伦。

‘No! Non e permesso di mettere il zampino nel tondinetto. Non piace al babbo. Un signor gatto cosi selvatico—!’
'不！禁止通电。非 piace al babbo。 Un Signor gatto cosi Selvatico——！’

And she kept her finger on the softly planted paw of the cat, and her voice had the same whimsical, humorous note of bullying.
她的手指一直放在猫柔软的爪子上，她的声音同样充满了异想天开、幽默的欺凌意味。

Ursula had her nose out of joint. She wanted to go away now. It all seemed no good. Hermione was established for ever, she herself was ephemeral and had not yet even arrived.
乌苏拉的鼻子脱臼了。她现在想离开。一切似乎都不好。赫敏已经永远存在，而她自己却转瞬即逝，甚至还没有到来。

‘I will go now,’ she said suddenly.
“我现在就走。”她突然说道。

Birkin looked at her almost in fear—he so dreaded her anger. ‘But there is no need for such hurry,’ he said.
伯金几乎带着恐惧地看着她——他非常害怕她的愤怒。 “但没有必要这么着急，”他说。

‘Yes,’ she answered. ‘I will go.’ And turning to Hermione, before there was time to say any more, she held out her hand and said ‘Good-bye.’
“是的，”她回答。 “我会走了。”她转向赫敏，还没来得及再说什么，就伸出手说“再见。”

‘Good-bye—‘ sang Hermione, detaining the band. ‘Must you really go now?’
“再见——”赫敏唱道，拦住了乐队。 “你现在真的必须走了吗？”

‘Yes, I think I’ll go,’ said Ursula, her face set, and averted from Hermione’s eyes.
“是的，我想我会去的，”乌苏拉说道，她的脸色僵硬，避开了赫敏的目光。

‘You think you will—‘
“你认为你会——”

But Ursula had got her hand free. She turned to Birkin with a quick, almost jeering: ‘Good-bye,’ and she was opening the door before he had time to do it for her.
但乌苏拉已经解放了她的手。她迅速转向伯金，几乎是在嘲笑：“再见。”在伯金有时间为她开门之前，她就打开了门。

When she got outside the house she ran down the road in fury and agitation. It was strange, the unreasoning rage and violence Hermione roused in her, by her very presence. Ursula knew she gave herself away to the other woman, she knew she looked ill-bred, uncouth, exaggerated. But she did not care. She only ran up the road, lest she should go back and jeer in the faces of the two she had left behind. For they outraged her.
当她走出家门时，她愤怒而激动地沿着路跑。奇怪的是，赫敏的出现在她心中激起了无端的愤怒和暴力。乌苏拉知道她把自己交给了另一个女人，她知道自己看起来没有教养、粗鲁、夸张。但她不在乎。她只是沿着路跑，免得回去后当面嘲笑她留下的两个人。因为他们激怒了她。

CHAPTER XXIII
第二十三章

EXCURSE
短途旅行

Next day Birkin sought Ursula out. It happened to be the half-day at the Grammar School. He appeared towards the end of the morning, and asked her, would she drive with him in the afternoon. She consented. But her face was closed and unresponding, and his heart sank.
第二天，伯金去找乌苏拉。碰巧是在文法学校上半天课。上午快结束的时候，他出现了，问她下午可以和他一起开车吗？她同意了。但她面无表情，没有任何反应，他的心沉了下去。

The afternoon was fine and dim. He was driving the motor-car, and she sat beside him. But still her face was closed against him, unresponding. When she became like this, like a wall against him, his heart contracted.
下午天气晴朗，光线昏暗。他开着汽车，她坐在他旁边。但她的脸仍然紧贴着他，没有任何反应。当她变成这样，就像一堵墙抵在他的身边时，他的心就收缩了。

His life now seemed so reduced, that he hardly cared any more. At moments it seemed to him he did not care a straw whether Ursula or Hermione or anybody else existed or did not exist. Why bother! Why strive for a coherent, satisfied life? Why not drift on in a series of accidents-like a picaresque novel? Why not? Why bother about human relationships? Why take them seriously-male or female? Why form any serious connections at all? Why not be casual, drifting along, taking all for what it was worth?
现在他的生命似乎如此减少，他几乎不再关心了。有时，他似乎根本不在乎乌苏拉、赫敏或其他人是否存在。何必呢！为什么要努力追求连贯、满意的生活？为什么不像流浪汉小说那样，在一系列的意外事件中继续前行呢？为什么不？何必在意人际关系呢？为什么要认真对待他们——男性还是女性？为什么要建立任何严肃的联系呢？为什么不随波逐流，随波逐流，物尽其用呢？

And yet, still, he was damned and doomed to the old effort at serious living.
然而，尽管如此，他还是被诅咒了，注定要继续过着严肃的生活。

‘Look,’ he said, ‘what I bought.’ The car was running along a broad white road, between autumn trees.
“看，”他说，“我买了什么。”汽车沿着一条宽阔的白色道路行驶，在秋天的树木之间。

He gave her a little bit of screwed-up paper. She took it and opened it.
他给了她一点乱七八糟的纸。她接过它并打开它。

‘How lovely,’ she cried.
“多可爱啊，”她喊道。

She examined the gift.
她检查了礼物。

‘How perfectly lovely!’ she cried again. ‘But why do you give them me?’ She put the question offensively.
“多么可爱啊！”她又喊道。 “但是你为什么要把它们给我呢？”她冒犯性地问了这个问题。

His face flickered with bored irritation. He shrugged his shoulders slightly.
他的脸上闪烁着无聊的恼怒。他轻轻耸了耸肩。

‘I wanted to,’ he said, coolly.
“我想这么做，”他冷静地说。

‘But why? Why should you?’
'但为什么？你为什么要？'

‘Am I called on to find reasons?’ he asked.
“我需要找理由吗？”他问道。

There was a silence, whilst she examined the rings that had been screwed up in the paper.
一阵沉默，她检查着纸上拧紧的环。

‘I think they are BEAUTIFUL,’ she said, ‘especially this. This is wonderful-’
“我认为它们很漂亮，”她说，“尤其是这个。”这太棒了——”

It was a round opal, red and fiery, set in a circle of tiny rubies.
这是一颗圆形蛋白石，红色火红，镶嵌在一圈小红宝石中。

‘You like that best?’ he said.
“你最喜欢那个？”他说。

‘I think I do.’
“我想我愿意。”

‘I like the sapphire,’ he said.
“我喜欢蓝宝石，”他说。

‘This?’
'这？'

It was a rose-shaped, beautiful sapphire, with small brilliants.
那是一颗玫瑰形状的、美丽的蓝宝石，上面有小钻石。

‘Yes,’ she said, ‘it is lovely.’ She held it in the light. ‘Yes, perhaps it IS the best-’
“是的，”她说，“它很可爱。”她把它放在灯光下。 “是的，也许这是最好的——”

‘The blue-’ he said.
“蓝色——”他说。

‘Yes, wonderful-’
“是的，太棒了——”

He suddenly swung the car out of the way of a farm-cart. It tilted on the bank. He was a careless driver, yet very quick. But Ursula was frightened. There was always that something regardless in him which terrified her. She suddenly felt he might kill her, by making some dreadful accident with the motor-car. For a moment she was stony with fear.
他突然把车转开，让开一辆农用车。它倾斜在河岸上。他是个粗心的司机，但速度却很快。但乌苏拉很害怕。他身上总有一种不顾一切的东西让她害怕。她突然觉得他可能会因为汽车发生可怕的事故而杀了她。一时之间，她吓得面无表情。

‘Isn’t it rather dangerous, the way you drive?’ she asked him.
“你开车的方式不是很危险吗？”她问他。

‘No, it isn’t dangerous,’ he said. And then, after a pause: ‘Don’t you like the yellow ring at all?’
“不，这并不危险，”他说。然后，停顿了一下：“你一点也不喜欢黄色戒指吗？”

It was a squarish topaz set in a frame of steel, or some other similar mineral, finely wrought.
它是一颗方形黄玉，镶嵌在精雕细琢的钢制框架或其他类似矿物中。

‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I do like it. But why did you buy these rings?’
“是的，”她说，“我确实喜欢它。”但你为什么买这些戒指呢？

‘I wanted them. They are second-hand.’
“我想要它们。”它们是二手的。

‘You bought them for yourself?’
“你自己买的？”

‘No. Rings look wrong on my hands.’
'不。我手上的戒指看起来不对劲。”

‘Why did you buy them then?’
“那你为什么买它们？”

‘I bought them to give to you.’
“我买它们是为了送给你。”

‘But why? Surely you ought to give them to Hermione! You belong to her.’
'但为什么？你当然应该把它们给赫敏！你属于她。

He did not answer. She remained with the jewels shut in her hand. She wanted to try them on her fingers, but something in her would not let her. And moreover, she was afraid her hands were too large, she shrank from the mortification of a failure to put them on any but her little finger. They travelled in silence through the empty lanes.
他没有回答。她手里仍然紧握着珠宝。她想在手指上试一试，但她体内的某种东西不允许她这么做。而且，她担心自己的手太大了，除了小指之外，她无法把它们放在任何其他手指上，这让她感到羞愧，她退缩了。他们默默地穿过空荡荡的小巷。

Driving in a motor-car excited her, she forgot his presence even.
驾驶汽车让她兴奋不已，她甚至忘记了他的存在。

‘Where are we?’ she asked suddenly.
“我们在哪儿？”她突然问道。

‘Not far from Worksop.’
“离沃克索普不远。”

‘And where are we going?’
“我们要去哪里？”

‘Anywhere.’
“任何地方。”

It was the answer she liked.
这是她喜欢的答案。

She opened her hand to look at the rings. They gave her SUCH pleasure, as they lay, the three circles, with their knotted jewels, entangled in her palm. She would have to try them on. She did so secretly, unwilling to let him see, so that he should not know her finger was too large for them. But he saw nevertheless. He always saw, if she wanted him not to. It was another of his hateful, watchful characteristics.
她张开手，看着戒指。当它们躺着时，这三个圆圈和打结的珠宝纠缠在她的手掌上，给了她如此多的快乐。她得试穿一下。她偷偷地这样做，不愿意让他看到，以免他知道她的手指对他们来说太大了。但他还是看到了。如果她不希望他看到，他总是能看到。这是他的另一个可恨、警惕的性格。

Only the opal, with its thin wire loop, would go on her ring finger. And she was superstitious. No, there was ill-portent enough, she would not accept this ring from him in pledge.
只有带细线环的蛋白石才会戴在她的无名指上。而且她很迷信。不，不祥之兆已经够多了，她不会接受他送来的这枚戒指作为抵押。

‘Look,’ she said, putting forward her hand, that was half-closed and shrinking. ‘The others don’t fit me.’
“看，”她伸出手说道，那只手半握着，正在收缩。 “其他的不适合我。”

He looked at the red-glinting, soft stone, on her over-sensitive skin.
他看着她过于敏感的皮肤上那颗闪着红光的柔软石头。

‘Yes,’ he said.
“是的，”他说。

‘But opals are unlucky, aren’t they?’ she said wistfully.
“但是蛋白石是不吉利的，不是吗？”她若有所思地说。

‘No. I prefer unlucky things. Luck is vulgar. Who wants what LUCK would bring? I don’t.’
'不。我更喜欢不幸的事情。运气是庸俗的。谁想要幸运带来的东西？我不。'

‘But why?’ she laughed.
“但是为什么呢？”她笑道。

And, consumed with a desire to see how the other rings would look on her hand, she put them on her little finger.
而且，她很想看看其他戒指戴在她手上会是什么样子，于是她把它们戴在了她的小指上。

‘They can be made a little bigger,’ he said.
“它们可以做得更大一点，”他说。

‘Yes,’ she replied, doubtfully. And she sighed. She knew that, in accepting the rings, she was accepting a pledge. Yet fate seemed more than herself. She looked again at the jewels. They were very beautiful to her eyes-not as ornament, or wealth, but as tiny fragments of loveliness.
“是的，”她疑惑地回答。她叹了口气。她知道，接受戒指就是接受誓言。然而命运似乎不仅仅是她自己。她又看了看珠宝。在她看来，它们非常美丽——不是装饰品，也不是财富，而是可爱的小碎片。

‘I’m glad you bought them,’ she said, putting her hand, half unwillingly, gently on his arm.
“我很高兴你买了它们，”她半不情愿地把手轻轻地放在他的手臂上，说道。

He smiled, slightly. He wanted her to come to him. But he was angry at the bottom of his soul, and indifferent. He knew she had a passion for him, really. But it was not finally interesting. There were depths of passion when one became impersonal and indifferent, unemotional. Whereas Ursula was still at the emotional personal level-always so abominably personal. He had taken her as he had never been taken himself. He had taken her at the roots of her darkness and shame-like a demon, laughing over the fountain of mystic corruption which was one of the sources of her being, laughing, shrugging, accepting, accepting finally. As for her, when would she so much go beyond herself as to accept him at the quick of death?
他微微一笑。他想让她来找他。但他心底却是愤怒，无动于衷。他知道她对他有热情，真的。但最终并不有趣。当一个人变得冷漠、冷漠、没有感情时，就会产生强烈的激情。而乌苏拉仍然处于个人情感层面——总是那么个人化。他带走了她，就像他自己从未被带走一样。他抓住了她黑暗和耻辱的根源——就像一个恶魔，对着神秘腐败的源泉大笑，那是她存在的源泉之一，大笑，耸肩，接受，最后接受。而她，什么时候才能如此超越自己，在临死之际接受他呢？

She now became quite happy. The motor-car ran on, the afternoon was soft and dim. She talked with lively interest, analysing people and their motives-Gudrun, Gerald. He answered vaguely. He was not very much interested any more in personalities and in people-people were all different, but they were all enclosed nowadays in a definite limitation, he said; there were only about two great ideas, two great streams of activity remaining, with various forms of reaction therefrom. The reactions were all varied in various people, but they followed a few great laws, and intrinsically there was no difference. They acted and reacted involuntarily according to a few great laws, and once the laws, the great principles, were known, people were no longer mystically interesting. They were all essentially alike, the differences were only variations on a theme. None of them transcended the given terms.
她现在变得很幸福。汽车继续前行，午后的天气柔和而昏暗。她饶有兴趣地说话，分析人们及其动机——古德伦、杰拉尔德。他含糊其辞地回答。他对个性和人不再感兴趣——人都是不同的，但现在他们都受到一定的限制，他说；只剩下大约两个伟大的想法，两个伟大的活动流，以及由此产生的各种形式的反应。不同人的反应各有不同，但都遵循着一些大规律，本质上并没有什么区别。他们根据一些伟大的法则不由自主地行动和反应，一旦这些法则、伟大的原则被了解，人们就不再神秘有趣了。它们本质上都是相似的，差异只是主题的变化。它们都没有超出给定的条款。

Ursula did not agree-people were still an adventure to her-but-perhaps not as much as she tried to persuade herself. Perhaps there was something mechanical, now, in her interest. Perhaps also her interest was destructive, her analysing was a real tearing to pieces. There was an under-space in her where she did not care for people and their idiosyncracies, even to destroy them. She seemed to touch for a moment this undersilence in herself, she became still, and she turned for a moment purely to Birkin.
乌苏拉不同意——人们对她来说仍然是一种冒险——但也许不像她试图说服自己的那么严重。也许现在有一些机械的东西符合她的兴趣。也许她的兴趣也是破坏性的，她的分析是真正的撕碎。她内心有一个深处的空间，她不关心人们和他们的特质，甚至不去毁灭他们。有一瞬间，她似乎触动了自己内心的这种低调，她变得安静，有一会儿纯粹地转向柏金。

‘Won’t it be lovely to go home in the dark?’ she said. ‘We might have tea rather late-shall we?-and have high tea? Wouldn’t that be rather nice?’
“在天黑时回家不是很好吗？”她说。 “我们可能会喝晚茶——可以吗？——喝下午茶？那不是很好吗？

‘I promised to be at Shortlands for dinner,’ he said.
“我答应去肖特兰兹吃晚饭，”他说。

‘But-it doesn’t matter-you can go tomorrow-’
“但是——没关系——你明天就可以去——”

‘Hermione is there,’ he said, in rather an uneasy voice. ‘She is going away in two days. I suppose I ought to say good-bye to her. I shall never see her again.’
“赫敏在那儿，”他用一种相当不安的声音说道。 ‘她两天后就要离开。我想我应该跟她说再见了。我再也见不到她了。

Ursula drew away, closed in a violent silence. He knitted his brows, and his eyes began to sparkle again in anger.
乌苏拉退开了，陷入了一阵剧烈的沉默。他皱起了眉头，眼中再次闪烁着愤怒的光芒。

‘You don’t mind, do you?’ he asked irritably.
“你不介意，是吗？”他烦躁地问道。

‘No, I don’t care. Why should I? Why should I mind?’ Her tone was jeering and offensive.
‘不，我不在乎。我为什么要？我为什么要介意？”她的语气充满嘲笑和攻击性。

‘That’s what I ask myself,’ he said; ‘why SHOULD you mind! But you seem to.’ His brows were tense with violent irritation.
“这就是我问自己的，”他说； ‘你为什么要介意！但你似乎是这样。”他的眉毛因强烈的刺激而紧绷。

‘I ASSURE you I don’t, I don’t mind in the least. Go where you belong-it’s what I want you to do.’
“我向你保证我不会，我一点也不介意。去你所属的地方——这就是我希望你做的事。

‘Ah you fool!’ he cried, ‘with your ‘go where you belong.’ It’s finished between Hermione and me. She means much more to YOU, if it comes to that, than she does to me. For you can only revolt in pure reaction from her-and to be her opposite is to be her counterpart.’
“啊，你这个傻瓜！”他喊道，“用你的‘去你该去的地方’。赫敏和我之间的事就结束了。如果说到这一点，她对你的意义比对我的意义要大得多。因为你只能以纯粹的反应来反抗她——而成为她的对立面就是成为她的对手。

‘Ah, opposite!’ cried Ursula. ‘I know your dodges. I am not taken in by your word-twisting. You belong to Hermione and her dead show. Well, if you do, you do. I don’t blame you. But then you’ve nothing to do with me.
“啊，对面！”乌苏拉喊道。 “我知道你的躲闪。我没有被你的歪曲事实所欺骗。你属于赫敏和她的死秀。好吧，如果你愿意，你就愿意。我不怪你。但那样你就和我没有任何关系了。

In his inflamed, overwrought exasperation, he stopped the car, and they sat there, in the middle of the country lane, to have it out. It was a crisis of war between them, so they did not see the ridiculousness of their situation.
在他极度愤怒的情绪中，他停下了车，他们坐在乡间小路的中间，想把事情解决掉。他们之间正值战争危机，所以他们并没有看到自己的处境有多么可笑。

‘If you weren’t a fool, if only you weren’t a fool,’ he cried in bitter despair, ‘you’d see that one could be decent, even when one has been wrong. I WAS wrong to go on all those years with Hermione—it was a deathly process. But after all, one can have a little human decency. But no, you would tear my soul out with your jealousy at the very mention of Hermione’s name.’
“如果你不是个傻瓜，如果你不是个傻瓜，”他痛苦绝望地喊道，“你就会发现，即使一个人错了，他也可以是正派的。”我和赫敏一起度过了这些年是错误的——这是一个致命的过程。但人毕竟可以有点做人的尊严。但不，只要一提到赫敏的名字，你就会因嫉妒而撕裂我的灵魂。

‘I jealous! I—jealous! You ARE mistaken if you think that. I’m not jealous in the least of Hermione, she is nothing to me, not THAT!’ And Ursula snapped her fingers. ‘No, it’s you who are a liar. It’s you who must return, like a dog to his vomit. It is what Hermione STANDS FOR that I HATE. I HATE it. It is lies, it is false, it is death. But you want it, you can’t help it, you can’t help yourself. You belong to that old, deathly way of living—then go back to it. But don’t come to me, for I’ve nothing to do with it.’
‘我嫉妒了！我——嫉妒！如果你这么认为，那你就错了。我一点也不嫉妒赫敏，她对我来说什么都不是，不是那样！”乌苏拉打了个响指。 ‘不，你才是骗子。你必须回来，就像狗回到自己的呕吐物一样。我讨厌赫敏所代表的东西。我恨它。这是谎言，这是错误，这是死亡。但你想要它，你无法控制它，你无法控制自己。你属于那种古老的、死气沉沉的生活方式——那就回去吧。但别来找我，因为这与我无关。”

And in the stress of her violent emotion, she got down from the car and went to the hedgerow, picking unconsciously some flesh-pink spindleberries, some of which were burst, showing their orange seeds.
在强烈的情绪压力下，她下了车，来到树篱旁，无意识地采摘了一些肉粉色的纺锤浆果，其中一些已经破裂，露出了橙色的种子。

‘Ah, you are a fool,’ he cried, bitterly, with some contempt.
“啊，你真是个傻瓜。”他痛苦地喊道，语气中带着一丝轻蔑。

‘Yes, I am. I AM a fool. And thank God for it. I’m too big a fool to swallow your cleverness. God be praised. You go to your women—go to them—they are your sort—you’ve always had a string of them trailing after you—and you always will. Go to your spiritual brides—but don’t come to me as well, because I’m not having any, thank you. You’re not satisfied, are you? Your spiritual brides can’t give you what you want, they aren’t common and fleshy enough for you, aren’t they? So you come to me, and keep them in the background! You will marry me for daily use. But you’ll keep yourself well provided with spiritual brides in the background. I know your dirty little game.’ Suddenly a flame ran over her, and she stamped her foot madly on the road, and he winced, afraid that she would strike him. ‘And I, I’M not spiritual enough, I’M not as spiritual as that Hermione—!’ Her brows knitted, her eyes blazed like a tiger’s. ‘Then go to her, that’s all I say, GO to her, GO. Ha, she spiritual—SPIRITUAL, she! A dirty materialist as she is. SHE spiritual? What does she care for, what is her spirituality? What IS it?’ Her fury seemed to blaze out and burn his face. He shrank a little. ‘I tell you it’s DIRT, DIRT, and nothing BUT dirt. And it’s dirt you want, you crave for it. Spiritual! Is THAT spiritual, her bullying, her conceit, her sordid materialism? She’s a fishwife, a fishwife, she is such a materialist. And all so sordid. What does she work out to, in the end, with all her social passion, as you call it. Social passion—what social passion has she?—show it me!—where is it? She wants petty, immediate POWER, she wants the illusion that she is a great woman, that is all. In her soul she’s a devilish unbeliever, common as dirt. That’s what she is at the bottom. And all the rest is pretence—but you love it. You love the sham spirituality, it’s your food. And why? Because of the dirt underneath. Do you think I don’t know the foulness of your sex life—and her’s?—I do. And it’s that foulness you want, you liar. Then have it, have it. You’re such a liar.’
'我是。我是个傻瓜。并为此感谢上帝。我真是个大傻瓜，无法吞下你的聪明才智。愿神受赞美。你去找你的女人——去找她们——她们是你的同类——你总是有一串女人在追随你——而且你永远都会。去找你的精神新娘吧——但也不要来找我，因为我没有，谢谢。你还不满意，是吗？你的精神新娘不能给你你想要的，他们对你来说不够普通、不够肉体，不是吗？所以你来找我，把他们留在幕后！你嫁给我是为了日常使用。但你会在后台为自己提供充足的精神新娘。我知道你的肮脏把戏。”突然，一股火焰从她身上蔓延开来，她在路上疯狂地跺着脚，他畏缩了一下，生怕她会打到他。 “而我，我不够灵性，我还没有那个赫敏那么灵性——！”她的眉头紧锁，眼睛像老虎一样闪闪发光。 ‘然后去找她，我就是这么说的，去找她，去。哈，她有灵性——有灵性，她！她是一个肮脏的唯物主义者。她有精神吗？她关心什么，她的灵性是什么？这是什么？”她的怒火似乎熊熊燃烧，烧伤了他的脸。他畏缩了一些。 “我告诉你，那是污垢，污垢，除了污垢什么也不是。”这就是你想要的、你渴望的泥土。精神！她的欺凌、她的自负、她肮脏的物质主义是精神层面的吗？她是一个鱼妇，一个鱼妇，她是一个唯物主义者。而且一切都是那么肮脏。正如你所说的那样，她带着她所有的社交热情，最终做了什么。社交热情——她有什么社交热情？——给我看看！——它在哪里？她想要微小的、直接的权力，她想要她是一个伟大女人的幻觉，仅此而已。在她的灵魂里，她是一个邪恶的不信者，像泥土一样平凡。这就是她在底层的情况。 其余的一切都是假装——但你喜欢它。你热爱虚假的灵性，它是你的食物。为什么？因为下面有脏东西。你以为我不知道你和她的性生活有多肮脏吗？我知道。这就是你想要的肮脏，你这个骗子。那就拥有吧，拥有吧。你个骗子。’

She turned away, spasmodically tearing the twigs of spindleberry from the hedge, and fastening them, with vibrating fingers, in the bosom of her coat.
她转过身去，痉挛般地从树篱上扯下纺锤浆果的小树枝，然后用颤抖的手指将它们固定在外套的胸前。

He stood watching in silence. A wonderful tenderness burned in him, at the sight of her quivering, so sensitive fingers: and at the same time he was full of rage and callousness.
他静静地站着观看。当看到她颤抖的、如此敏感的手指时，他心中燃烧着一种美妙的温柔：同时他又充满了愤怒和冷酷。

‘This is a degrading exhibition,’ he said coolly.
“这是一场有辱人格的展览，”他冷静地说。

‘Yes, degrading indeed,’ she said. ‘But more to me than to you.’
“是的，确实有辱人格，”她说。 “但对我来说比对你来说更重要。”

‘Since you choose to degrade yourself,’ he said. Again the flash came over her face, the yellow lights concentrated in her eyes.
“既然你选择贬低自己，”他说。闪光再次照在她的脸上，黄色的光芒集中在她的眼睛上。

‘YOU!’ she cried. ‘You! You truth-lover! You purity-monger! It STINKS, your truth and your purity. It stinks of the offal you feed on, you scavenger dog, you eater of corpses. You are foul, FOUL and you must know it. Your purity, your candour, your goodness—yes, thank you, we’ve had some. What you are is a foul, deathly thing, obscene, that’s what you are, obscene and perverse. You, and love! You may well say, you don’t want love. No, you want YOURSELF, and dirt, and death—that’s what you want. You are so PERVERSE, so death-eating. And then—‘
“你！”她喊道。 '你！你这个热爱真理的人！你这个纯洁贩子！你的真理和纯洁很臭。散发着你吃的内脏的臭味，你这个食腐狗，你这个吃尸体的人。你犯规了，犯规了，你必须知道这一点。你的纯洁、你的坦率、你的善良——是的，谢谢你，我们已经拥有了一些。你就是一个肮脏的、致命的东西、淫秽的，这就是你，淫秽的、邪恶的。你，还有爱！你可能会说，你不想要爱。不，你想要你自己，还有泥土，还有死亡——这就是你想要的。你太邪恶了，太食死徒了。进而-'

‘There’s a bicycle coming,’ he said, writhing under her loud denunciation.
“有一辆自行车来了，”他在她大声的谴责声中扭动着说道。

She glanced down the road.
她朝路边看了一眼。

‘I don’t care,’ she cried.
“我不在乎，”她哭道。

Nevertheless she was silent. The cyclist, having heard the voices raised in altercation, glanced curiously at the man, and the woman, and at the standing motor-car as he passed.
尽管如此，她还是沉默了。骑自行车的人听到争吵声，好奇地看了看那男人、那女人，还有路过的停着的汽车。

‘—Afternoon,’ he said, cheerfully.
“——下午，”他高兴地说。

‘Good-afternoon,’ replied Birkin coldly.
“下午好，”伯金冷冷地回答。

They were silent as the man passed into the distance.
当那个人走向远方时，他们都沉默了。

A clearer look had come over Birkin’s face. He knew she was in the main right. He knew he was perverse, so spiritual on the one hand, and in some strange way, degraded, on the other. But was she herself any better? Was anybody any better?
伯金的脸上露出了更加清晰的表情。他知道她是偏右派。他知道自己一方面很乖僻，很属灵，另一方面又以某种奇怪的方式堕落。但她自己有好一点吗？有人有更好的吗？

‘It may all be true, lies and stink and all,’ he said. ‘But Hermione’s spiritual intimacy is no rottener than your emotional-jealous intimacy. One can preserve the decencies, even to one’s enemies: for one’s own sake. Hermione is my enemy—to her last breath! That’s why I must bow her off the field.’
“这可能都是真的，也可能是谎言，也可能是恶臭之类的，”他说。 “但是赫敏的精神上的亲密并不比你情感上嫉妒的亲密更腐烂。一个人可以为了自己的利益而保持体面，甚至对敌人也是如此。赫敏是我的敌人——直到她最后一口气！这就是为什么我必须向她鞠躬离开球场。

‘You! You and your enemies and your bows! A pretty picture you make of yourself. But it takes nobody in but yourself. I JEALOUS! I! What I say,’ her voice sprang into flame, ‘I say because it is TRUE, do you see, because you are YOU, a foul and false liar, a whited sepulchre. That’s why I say it. And YOU hear it.’
'你！你和你的敌人还有你的弓！你为自己画的漂亮照片。但它只需要你自己。我嫉妒了！我！我说的话，”她的声音变得火热起来，“我说因为这是真的，你明白吗，因为你就是你，一个卑鄙而虚假的骗子，一座白色的坟墓。这就是我这么说的原因。你听到了。

‘And be grateful,’ he added, with a satirical grimace.
“并且要心存感激，”他补充道，脸上带着讽刺的表情。

‘Yes,’ she cried, ‘and if you have a spark of decency in you, be grateful.’
“是的，”她喊道，“如果你有一丝正派的火花，那就心存感激。”

‘Not having a spark of decency, however—‘ he retorted.
“然而，没有一点正派的火花——”他反驳道。

‘No,’ she cried, ‘you haven’t a SPARK. And so you can go your way, and I’ll go mine. It’s no good, not the slightest. So you can leave me now, I don’t want to go any further with you—leave me—‘
“不，”她喊道，“你没有火花。”所以你可以走你的路，我走我的路。这不好，一点也不好。所以你现在可以离开我了，我不想和你再进一步——离开我——”

‘You don’t even know where you are,’ he said.
“你甚至不知道自己在哪里，”他说。

‘Oh, don’t bother, I assure you I shall be all right. I’ve got ten shillings in my purse, and that will take me back from anywhere YOU have brought me to.’ She hesitated. The rings were still on her fingers, two on her little finger, one on her ring finger. Still she hesitated.
“哦，别麻烦了，我向你保证我会没事的。我的钱包里有十先令，这将带我从你带我去的任何地方回来。”她犹豫了。戒指还戴在她的手指上，小指上有两枚，无名指上有一枚。她还是犹豫了。

‘Very good,’ he said. ‘The only hopeless thing is a fool.’
“很好，”他说。 “唯一没有希望的就是傻瓜。”

‘You are quite right,’ she said.
“你说得很对，”她说。

Still she hesitated. Then an ugly, malevolent look came over her face, she pulled the rings from her fingers, and tossed them at him. One touched his face, the others hit his coat, and they scattered into the mud.
她还是犹豫了。然后她脸上露出丑陋、恶毒的表情，她从手指上取下戒指，扔给他。一个碰了他的脸，另一个碰了他的外套，然后他们就散到了泥里。

‘And take your rings,’ she said, ‘and go and buy yourself a female elsewhere—there are plenty to be had, who will be quite glad to share your spiritual mess,—or to have your physical mess, and leave your spiritual mess to Hermione.’
“带上你的戒指，”她说，“去别处给自己买一个女人——有很多东西可以拥有，她们会很乐意分享你精神上的混乱——或者让你身体上的混乱，留下你精神上的混乱。”把赫敏搞乱了。

With which she walked away, desultorily, up the road. He stood motionless, watching her sullen, rather ugly walk. She was sullenly picking and pulling at the twigs of the hedge as she passed. She grew smaller, she seemed to pass out of his sight. A darkness came over his mind. Only a small, mechanical speck of consciousness hovered near him.
说完，她就沿着大路漫无目的地走开了。他一动不动地站着，看着她阴沉而难看的步态。当她经过时，她阴沉地拉着树篱的树枝。她变得越来越小，似乎消失在他的视线里。一片黑暗笼罩了他的心头。只有一个小小的、机械的意识点在他附近盘旋。

He felt tired and weak. Yet also he was relieved. He gave up his old position. He went and sat on the bank. No doubt Ursula was right. It was true, really, what she said. He knew that his spirituality was concomitant of a process of depravity, a sort of pleasure in self-destruction. There really WAS a certain stimulant in self-destruction, for him—especially when it was translated spiritually. But then he knew it—he knew it, and had done. And was not Ursula’s way of emotional intimacy, emotional and physical, was it not just as dangerous as Hermione’s abstract spiritual intimacy? Fusion, fusion, this horrible fusion of two beings, which every woman and most men insisted on, was it not nauseous and horrible anyhow, whether it was a fusion of the spirit or of the emotional body? Hermione saw herself as the perfect Idea, to which all men must come: And Ursula was the perfect Womb, the bath of birth, to which all men must come! And both were horrible. Why could they not remain individuals, limited by their own limits? Why this dreadful all-comprehensiveness, this hateful tyranny? Why not leave the other being, free, why try to absorb, or melt, or merge? One might abandon oneself utterly to the MOMENTS, but not to any other being.
他感到疲倦和虚弱。但同时他也松了口气。他放弃了原来的职位。他走过去坐在岸边。毫无疑问，乌苏拉是对的。她说的是真的，真的。他知道他的灵性伴随着一个堕落的过程，一种自我毁灭的快乐。对他来说，自我毁灭确实有某种兴奋剂——尤其是当它被转化为精神层面的时候。但后来他知道了——他知道了，而且已经做到了。乌苏拉的情感亲密方式，无论是情感上的还是身体上的，难道不是和赫敏抽象的精神上的亲密一样危险吗？融合，融合，这种可怕的两个存在的融合，是每个女人和大多数男人所坚持的，不管是精神的融合还是情感体的融合，这不是令人恶心和可怕的吗？赫敏认为自己是所有男人都必须追求的完美理念：而乌苏拉是所有男人都必须追求的完美子宫，诞生的浴场！两者都很可怕。为什么他们不能保持个体性，受自身限制的限制呢？为什么会有这种可怕的全面性、这种可恨的暴政？为什么不让对方自由，为什么要尝试吸收、融化或融合？一个人可能会完全放弃自己，沉浸在瞬间，但不会放弃任何其他存在。

He could not bear to see the rings lying in the pale mud of the road. He picked them up, and wiped them unconsciously on his hands. They were the little tokens of the reality of beauty, the reality of happiness in warm creation. But he had made his hands all dirty and gritty.
他不忍心看到那些年轮躺在路上苍白的泥巴里。他拿起它们，无意识地在手上擦拭。它们是美丽的现实、温暖的创造中的幸福的现实的小象征。但他的双手却又脏又沙。

There was a darkness over his mind. The terrible knot of consciousness that had persisted there like an obsession was broken, gone, his life was dissolved in darkness over his limbs and his body. But there was a point of anxiety in his heart now. He wanted her to come back. He breathed lightly and regularly like an infant, that breathes innocently, beyond the touch of responsibility.
他的心里一片黑暗。那些像痴迷一样持续在那里的可怕的意识结被打破了，消失了，他的生命溶解在他四肢和身体上的黑暗中。但现在他的心里却有一丝不安。他想让她回来。他的呼吸轻而规律，就像婴儿一样，天真地呼吸着，超越了责任感。

She was coming back. He saw her drifting desultorily under the high hedge, advancing towards him slowly. He did not move, he did not look again. He was as if asleep, at peace, slumbering and utterly relaxed.
她要回来了。他看见她在高高的树篱下漫无目的地漂流，慢慢地向他走来。他没有动，也没有再看。他就像睡着了一样，安详、熟睡、完全放松。

She came up and stood before him, hanging her head.
她起身站在他面前，低着头。

‘See what a flower I found you,’ she said, wistfully holding a piece of purple-red bell-heather under his face. He saw the clump of coloured bells, and the tree-like, tiny branch: also her hands, with their over-fine, over-sensitive skin.
“看看我给你找到了一朵多漂亮的花，”她说道，若有所思地把一片紫红色的钟形石南花放在他的脸下。他看到了那丛彩色的铃铛，还有那棵树一样的小树枝，还有她的双手，皮肤过于细腻、过于敏感。

‘Pretty!’ he said, looking up at her with a smile, taking the flower. Everything had become simple again, quite simple, the complexity gone into nowhere. But he badly wanted to cry: except that he was weary and bored by emotion.
“漂亮！”他微笑着抬头看着她，接过花。一切又变得简单了，非常简单，复杂性消失得无影无踪。但他非常想哭：只是他因为情感而感到疲倦和无聊。

Then a hot passion of tenderness for her filled his heart. He stood up and looked into her face. It was new and oh, so delicate in its luminous wonder and fear. He put his arms round her, and she hid her face on his shoulder.
于是，他的心里充满了对她的炽热的柔情。他站起来，看着她的脸。它是新的，哦，在它明亮的奇迹和恐惧中如此微妙。他用双臂搂住她，她把脸埋在他的肩膀上。

It was peace, just simple peace, as he stood folding her quietly there on the open lane. It was peace at last. The old, detestable world of tension had passed away at last, his soul was strong and at ease.
当他静静地站在空旷的小路上时，那是一种平静，只是简单的平静。终于迎来了和平。旧日的、可憎的、紧张的世界终于过去了，他的灵魂坚强而轻松。

She looked up at him. The wonderful yellow light in her eyes now was soft and yielded, they were at peace with each other. He kissed her, softly, many, many times. A laugh came into her eyes.
她抬头看着他。她眼中美妙的黄光现在变得柔和而屈服，他们彼此平静。他吻了她，轻轻的，很多很多次。她的眼里闪过一丝笑意。

‘Did I abuse you?’ she asked.
“我虐待你了吗？”她问道。

He smiled too, and took her hand, that was so soft and given.
他也微笑着，握住了她的手，那只手是如此的柔软和给予。

‘Never mind,’ she said, ‘it is all for the good.’ He kissed her again, softly, many times.
“没关系，”她说，“这都是为了好。”他再次轻轻地吻了她很多次。

‘Isn’t it?’ she said.
“不是吗？”她说。

‘Certainly,’ he replied. ‘Wait! I shall have my own back.’
“当然，”他回答道。 '等待！我会得到自己的支持。

She laughed suddenly, with a wild catch in her voice, and flung her arms around him.
她突然大笑起来，声音里充满了狂野的气息，然后张开双臂搂住了他。

‘You are mine, my love, aren’t you?’ she cried straining him close.
“你是我的，我的爱人，不是吗？”她叫道，紧紧地抱住他。

‘Yes,’ he said, softly.
“是的，”他轻声说道。

His voice was so soft and final, she went very still, as if under a fate which had taken her. Yes, she acquiesced—but it was accomplished without her acquiescence. He was kissing her quietly, repeatedly, with a soft, still happiness that almost made her heart stop beating.
他的声音如此轻柔而坚定，她一动不动，仿佛命运已经夺走了她的生命。是的，她默许了——但这件事是在没有她默许的情况下完成的。他静静地、反复地吻着她，带着一种柔软而平静的幸福，几乎让她的心脏停止跳动。

‘My love!’ she cried, lifting her face and looking with frightened, gentle wonder of bliss. Was it all real? But his eyes were beautiful and soft and immune from stress or excitement, beautiful and smiling lightly to her, smiling with her. She hid her face on his shoulder, hiding before him, because he could see her so completely. She knew he loved her, and she was afraid, she was in a strange element, a new heaven round about her. She wished he were passionate, because in passion she was at home. But this was so still and frail, as space is more frightening than force.
“我的爱人！”她喊道，抬起头，脸上带着惊恐的、温柔的、幸福的惊奇。这一切都是真的吗？但他的眼睛美丽而柔和，不受压力或兴奋的影响，美丽且对她轻轻微笑，与她一起微笑。她把脸埋在他的肩膀上，躲在他面前，因为他能看得清清楚楚。她知道他爱她，但她很害怕，她处于一种奇怪的环境中，周围有一个新的天堂。她希望他充满激情，因为在激情中她感到宾至如归。但这是那么的静止和脆弱，因为空间比力量更可怕。

Again, quickly, she lifted her head.
她再次迅速抬起头。

‘Do you love me?’ she said, quickly, impulsively.
“你爱我吗？”她快速而冲动地说。

‘Yes,’ he replied, not heeding her motion, only her stillness.
“是的，”他回答道，没有注意到她的动作，只注意到她的安静。

She knew it was true. She broke away.
她知道这是真的。她挣脱了。

‘So you ought,’ she said, turning round to look at the road. ‘Did you find the rings?’
“所以你应该这么做，”她说，转身看着路。 “你找到戒指了吗？”

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

‘Where are they?’
'他们在哪里？'

‘In my pocket.’
'在我的口袋里。'

She put her hand into his pocket and took them out.
她把手伸进他的口袋，然后拿出来。

She was restless.
她焦躁不安。

‘Shall we go?’ she said.
“我们走吧？”她说。

‘Yes,’ he answered. And they mounted to the car once more, and left behind them this memorable battle-field.
“是的，”他回答道。他们再次登上车子，留下了这个令人难忘的战场。

They drifted through the wild, late afternoon, in a beautiful motion that was smiling and transcendent. His mind was sweetly at ease, the life flowed through him as from some new fountain, he was as if born out of the cramp of a womb.
他们在午后的荒野中漂流，动作优美，微笑着，超凡脱俗。他的心灵甜蜜地轻松自在，生命在他体内流淌，就像从某种新的喷泉中流淌出来，他仿佛是从子宫的痉挛中诞生的。

‘Are you happy?’ she asked him, in her strange, delighted way.
“你幸福吗？”她用一种奇怪而高兴的方式问他。

‘Yes,’ he said.
“是的，”他说。

‘So am I,’ she cried in sudden ecstacy, putting her arm round him and clutching him violently against her, as he steered the motor-car.
“我也是，”她突然狂喜地喊道，当他驾驶汽车时，她用手臂搂住他，用力把他紧紧地抱在自己身上。

‘Don’t drive much more,’ she said. ‘I don’t want you to be always doing something.’
“别再开车了，”她说。 “我不希望你总是在做某事。”

‘No,’ he said. ‘We’ll finish this little trip, and then we’ll be free.’
“不，”他说。 “我们会完成这次短暂的旅行，然后我们就自由了。”

‘We will, my love, we will,’ she cried in delight, kissing him as he turned to her.
“我们会的，我的爱人，我们会的，”她高兴地喊道，在他转向她时亲吻了他。

He drove on in a strange new wakefulness, the tension of his consciousness broken. He seemed to be conscious all over, all his body awake with a simple, glimmering awareness, as if he had just come awake, like a thing that is born, like a bird when it comes out of an egg, into a new universe.
他带着一种奇怪的清醒状态继续前行，意识的紧张被打破了。他似乎浑身都有意识，整个身体都清醒着，带着一种简单的、闪烁着的意识，就好像他刚刚醒来，就像一个诞生的东西，就像一只从蛋里出来的鸟，进入一个新的宇宙。

They dropped down a long hill in the dusk, and suddenly Ursula recognised on her right hand, below in the hollow, the form of Southwell Minster.
他们在黄昏中下了一座长长的山丘，突然乌苏拉认出了她右手上的凹地里有绍斯韦尔大教堂的身影。

‘Are we here!’ she cried with pleasure.
“我们到了吗？”她高兴地喊道。

The rigid, sombre, ugly cathedral was settling under the gloom of the coming night, as they entered the narrow town, the golden lights showed like slabs of revelation, in the shop-windows.
僵硬、阴沉、丑陋的大教堂在即将到来的夜色的阴沉下显得沉稳，当他们进入狭窄的城镇时，金色的灯光在商店橱窗里显现出来，就像一块启示录。

‘Father came here with mother,’ she said, ‘when they first knew each other. He loves it—he loves the Minster. Do you?’
“父亲和母亲一起来到这里，”她说，“当他们第一次认识的时候。他喜欢它——他喜欢大教堂。你？'

‘Yes. It looks like quartz crystals sticking up out of the dark hollow. We’ll have our high tea at the Saracen’s Head.’
'是的。它看起来就像石英晶体从黑暗的空洞中伸出来。我们将在撒拉逊人头享用下午茶。

As they descended, they heard the Minster bells playing a hymn, when the hour had struck six.
当他们下山时，他们听到大教堂的钟声正在奏响赞美诗，当时已经六点钟了。

Glory to thee my God this night
今晚荣耀归于你我的上帝

For all the blessings of the light—
为了所有光明的祝福——

So, to Ursula’s ear, the tune fell out, drop by drop, from the unseen sky on to the dusky town. It was like dim, bygone centuries sounding. It was all so far off. She stood in the old yard of the inn, smelling of straw and stables and petrol. Above, she could see the first stars. What was it all? This was no actual world, it was the dream-world of one’s childhood—a great circumscribed reminiscence. The world had become unreal. She herself was a strange, transcendent reality.
于是，在乌苏拉的耳中，曲调一滴一滴地从看不见的天空传到昏暗的小镇。听起来就像是昏暗的、过去的几个世纪。一切都那么遥远。她站在客栈的旧院子里，闻着稻草、马厩和汽油的味道。在上方，她可以看到第一颗星星。到底是什么？这不是真实的世界，而是童年的梦境——一段巨大的、有限的回忆。世界变得不真实了。她本身就是一个奇怪的、超然的现实。

They sat together in a little parlour by the fire.
他们一起坐在小客厅的火边。

‘Is it true?’ she said, wondering.
“这是真的吗？”她疑惑地说。

‘What?’
'什么？'

‘Everything—is everything true?’
“一切——一切都是真的吗？”

‘The best is true,’ he said, grimacing at her.
“最好的都是真的，”他说，对她做了个鬼脸。

‘Is it?’ she replied, laughing, but unassured.
“是吗？”她笑着回答，但并不确定。

She looked at him. He seemed still so separate. New eyes were opened in her soul. She saw a strange creature from another world, in him. It was as if she were enchanted, and everything were metamorphosed. She recalled again the old magic of the Book of Genesis, where the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair. And he was one of these, one of these strange creatures from the beyond, looking down at her, and seeing she was fair.
她看着他。他看起来还是那么孤立。她的灵魂中打开了新的眼睛。她在他身上看到了来自另一个世界的奇怪生物。她仿佛着了魔，一切都发生了变化。她再次想起《创世记》中的古老魔法，上帝的儿子们看到人类的女儿们，她们是美丽的。他就是其中之一，来自天外的奇怪生物之一，俯视着她，看到她是美丽的。

He stood on the hearth-rug looking at her, at her face that was upturned exactly like a flower, a fresh, luminous flower, glinting faintly golden with the dew of the first light. And he was smiling faintly as if there were no speech in the world, save the silent delight of flowers in each other. Smilingly they delighted in each other’s presence, pure presence, not to be thought of, even known. But his eyes had a faintly ironical contraction.
他站在壁炉边的地毯上看着她，看着她仰起的脸，就像一朵花，一朵新鲜的、发光的花，在第一缕阳光的露珠的照射下闪烁着淡淡的金色。而他则淡淡地微笑着，仿佛世间没有言语，只有花儿彼此间的无声喜悦。他们微笑着为彼此的存在感到高兴，纯粹的存在，不被想到，甚至不为人所知。但他的眼神却带着一丝讽刺的收缩。

And she was drawn to him strangely, as in a spell. Kneeling on the hearth-rug before him, she put her arms round his loins, and put her face against his thigh. Riches! Riches! She was overwhelmed with a sense of a heavenful of riches.
她奇怪地被他吸引了，就像着了魔一样。她跪在他面前的壁炉地毯上，用双臂搂住他的腰，把脸贴在他的大腿上。富有！富有！她有一种富贵在天的感觉。

‘We love each other,’ she said in delight.
“我们彼此相爱，”她高兴地说。

‘More than that,’ he answered, looking down at her with his glimmering, easy face.
“不仅如此，”他回答道，低头看着她，脸上闪烁着光芒，从容不迫。

Unconsciously, with her sensitive fingertips, she was tracing the back of his thighs, following some mysterious life-flow there. She had discovered something, something more than wonderful, more wonderful than life itself. It was the strange mystery of his life-motion, there, at the back of the thighs, down the flanks. It was a strange reality of his being, the very stuff of being, there in the straight downflow of the thighs. It was here she discovered him one of the sons of God such as were in the beginning of the world, not a man, something other, something more.
她不自觉地用敏感的指尖，抚摸着他的大腿后侧，追踪着那里某种神秘的生命流动。她发现了一些东西，一些比生活本身更美妙的东西。这是他生命运动的奇怪奥秘，就在那里，在大腿后面，沿着侧腹。这是他存在的一个奇怪的现实，存在的本质，就在大腿的笔直向下流动中。正是在这里，她发现他是上帝的儿子之一，就像世界之初那样，不是一个人，而是其他的东西，更多的东西。

This was release at last. She had had lovers, she had known passion. But this was neither love nor passion. It was the daughters of men coming back to the sons of God, the strange inhuman sons of God who are in the beginning.
这终于被释放了。她有过情人，她懂得激情。但这既不是爱，也不是激情。是人类的女儿们回到了上帝的儿子们身边，那些在太初的上帝的奇怪的、非人性的儿子们。

Her face was now one dazzle of released, golden light, as she looked up at him, and laid her hands full on his thighs, behind, as he stood before her. He looked down at her with a rich bright brow like a diadem above his eyes. She was beautiful as a new marvellous flower opened at his knees, a paradisal flower she was, beyond womanhood, such a flower of luminousness. Yet something was tight and unfree in him. He did not like this crouching, this radiance—not altogether.
当她抬头看着他时，她的脸现在散发出一抹耀眼的金色光芒，当他站在她面前时，她的双手放在他身后的大腿上。他低头看着她，浓密明亮的眉毛像王冠一样盖在眼睛上方。她美丽得像一朵奇妙的新花在他膝下绽放，她是一朵天堂之花，超越了女人的气质，是一朵明亮的花朵。然而他身上有什么东西是紧绷的、不自由的。他不喜欢这种蹲下的姿势，不喜欢这种光芒四射——不完全喜欢。

It was all achieved, for her. She had found one of the sons of God from the Beginning, and he had found one of the first most luminous daughters of men.
对于她来说，这一切都已经实现了。她从一开始就找到了上帝的儿子之一，而他找到了人类最早最光明的女儿之一。

She traced with her hands the line of his loins and thighs, at the back, and a living fire ran through her, from him, darkly. It was a dark flood of electric passion she released from him, drew into herself. She had established a rich new circuit, a new current of passional electric energy, between the two of them, released from the darkest poles of the body and established in perfect circuit. It was a dark fire of electricity that rushed from him to her, and flooded them both with rich peace, satisfaction.
她用手抚摸着他的腰部和大腿的线条，在后面，一股活生生的火从他身上流过她的全身，黑暗。她从他身上释放出一股黑暗的电流般的激情，吸引到自己身上。她在他们两人之间建立了一个丰富的新回路，一股新的激情电流，从身体最黑暗的两极释放出来，建立了完美的回路。那是一股黑暗的电流之火从他身上冲向她，让他们俩都充满了丰富的平静和满足。

‘My love,’ she cried, lifting her face to him, her eyes, her mouth open in transport.
“我的爱人，”她喊道，抬起脸面对他，眼睛张开，嘴巴激动。

‘My love,’ he answered, bending and kissing her, always kissing her.
“我的爱人，”他回答道，弯腰亲吻她，总是亲吻她。

She closed her hands over the full, rounded body of his loins, as he stooped over her, she seemed to touch the quick of the mystery of darkness that was bodily him. She seemed to faint beneath, and he seemed to faint, stooping over her. It was a perfect passing away for both of them, and at the same time the most intolerable accession into being, the marvellous fullness of immediate gratification, overwhelming, out-flooding from the source of the deepest life-force, the darkest, deepest, strangest life-source of the human body, at the back and base of the loins.
她用双手捂住他丰满圆润的腰部，当他俯身在她身上时，她似乎触到了他身体上那神秘的黑暗的快感。她似乎晕倒了，他也似乎晕倒了，弯下腰压在她身上。对于他们两人来说，这是一次完美的离去，同时也是最难以忍受的进入，立即满足的奇妙满足，压倒性的，从最深的生命力、最黑暗、最深沉的源泉中涌出。人体最奇怪的生命源，在腰部的后部和基部。

After a lapse of stillness, after the rivers of strange dark fluid richness had passed over her, flooding, carrying away her mind and flooding down her spine and down her knees, past her feet, a strange flood, sweeping away everything and leaving her an essential new being, she was left quite free, she was free in complete ease, her complete self. So she rose, stilly and blithe, smiling at him. He stood before her, glimmering, so awfully real, that her heart almost stopped beating. He stood there in his strange, whole body, that had its marvellous fountains, like the bodies of the sons of God who were in the beginning. There were strange fountains of his body, more mysterious and potent than any she had imagined or known, more satisfying, ah, finally, mystically-physically satisfying. She had thought there was no source deeper than the phallic source. And now, behold, from the smitten rock of the man’s body, from the strange marvellous flanks and thighs, deeper, further in mystery than the phallic source, came the floods of ineffable darkness and ineffable riches.
一阵寂静之后，一股奇怪的黑色液体丰富的河流从她身上流过，洪水泛滥，带走了她的思绪，顺着她的脊椎、膝盖流过，流过她的脚，一股奇怪的洪水，席卷了一切，只剩下她一个人。本质上的新存在，她变得非常自由，她完全轻松地自由，她完整的自我。于是她站了起来，一动不动，愉快地对他微笑。他站在她面前，闪闪发光，那么真实，让她的心脏几乎停止跳动。他站在那儿，身体奇特而完整，有奇妙的源泉，就像太初上帝众子的身体一样。他的身体里有奇怪的喷泉，比她想象或知道的任何东西都更神秘、更强大，更令人满意，啊，最后，神秘的身体上的满足。她曾以为没有比阴茎源头更深的源头了。现在，看哪，从那人身体被击打的岩石中，从奇怪奇妙的侧腹和大腿中，比阳具的源头更深、更神秘的地方，涌出了不可言喻的黑暗和不可言喻的财富的洪流。

They were glad, and they could forget perfectly. They laughed, and went to the meal provided. There was a venison pasty, of all things, a large broad-faced cut ham, eggs and cresses and red beet-root, and medlars and apple-tart, and tea.
他们很高兴，他们可以完全忘记。他们笑了，然后去吃提供的饭菜。里面有一份鹿肉馅饼，还有一大块宽面切火腿、鸡蛋、水芹、红甜菜根、枸杞、苹果馅饼和茶。

‘What GOOD things!’ she cried with pleasure. ‘How noble it looks!—shall I pour out the tea?—‘
“多好的事情啊！”她高兴地喊道。 “看起来多么高贵啊！——我要倒茶吗？——”

She was usually nervous and uncertain at performing these public duties, such as giving tea. But today she forgot, she was at her ease, entirely forgetting to have misgivings. The tea-pot poured beautifully from a proud slender spout. Her eyes were warm with smiles as she gave him his tea. She had learned at last to be still and perfect.
她在执行这些公共职责时通常会感到紧张和不确定，例如递茶。但今天她忘记了，她很轻松，完全忘记了疑虑。茶壶从细长的壶嘴里倒出漂亮的茶水。当她给他倒茶时，她的眼睛里充满了温暖的微笑。她终于学会了保持平静和完美。

‘Everything is ours,’ she said to him.
“一切都是我们的，”她对他说。

‘Everything,’ he answered.
“一切，”他回答。

She gave a queer little crowing sound of triumph.
她发出一种奇怪的胜利的小叫声。

‘I’m so glad!’ she cried, with unspeakable relief.
“我太高兴了！”她喊道，脸上带着难以言表的宽慰。

‘So am I,’ he said. ‘But I’m thinking we’d better get out of our responsibilities as quick as we can.’
“我也是，”他说。 “但我认为我们最好尽快摆脱我们的责任。”

‘What responsibilities?’ she asked, wondering.
“什么责任？”她疑惑地问道。

‘We must drop our jobs, like a shot.’
“我们必须像射击一样放弃工作。”

A new understanding dawned into her face.
她的脸上浮现出一种新的理解。

‘Of course,’ she said, ‘there’s that.’
“当然，”她说，“就是这样。”

‘We must get out,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing for it but to get out, quick.’
“我们必须出去，”他说。 “除了赶紧出去，别无他法。”

She looked at him doubtfully across the table.
她疑惑地看着桌子对面的他。

‘But where?’ she said.
“但是在哪里呢？”她说。

‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘We’ll just wander about for a bit.’
“我不知道，”他说。 “我们就到处逛逛吧。”

Again she looked at him quizzically.
她再次疑惑地看着他。

‘I should be perfectly happy at the Mill,’ she said.
“我在磨坊应该非常开心，”她说。

‘It’s very near the old thing,’ he said. ‘Let us wander a bit.’
“它非常接近旧的东西，”他说。 “我们去逛逛吧。”

His voice could be so soft and happy-go-lucky, it went through her veins like an exhilaration. Nevertheless she dreamed of a valley, and wild gardens, and peace. She had a desire too for splendour—an aristocratic extravagant splendour. Wandering seemed to her like restlessness, dissatisfaction.
他的声音是如此的温柔和无忧无虑，就像一种兴奋一样穿过她的血管。尽管如此，她仍然梦想着一座山谷、野生花园和宁静。她也渴望华丽——一种贵族式的奢华。在她看来，徘徊就像是不安和不满。

‘Where will you wander to?’ she asked.
“你要去哪儿？”她问。

‘I don’t know. I feel as if I would just meet you and we’d set off—just towards the distance.’
'我不知道。我感觉好像只要遇见你，我们就出发——朝着远方出发。

‘But where can one go?’ she asked anxiously. ‘After all, there is only the world, and none of it is very distant.’
“但是我们能去哪里呢？”她焦急地问道。 “毕竟，只有这个世界，而且一切都不是很遥远。”

‘Still,’ he said, ‘I should like to go with you—nowhere. It would be rather wandering just to nowhere. That’s the place to get to—nowhere. One wants to wander away from the world’s somewheres, into our own nowhere.’
“不过，”他说，“我还是想和你一起去——哪儿也不去。”它宁愿徘徊无处可去。那就是要去的地方——无处可去。人们想要远离世界的某个地方，进入我们自己的地方。

Still she meditated.
她仍然沉思着。

‘You see, my love,’ she said, ‘I’m so afraid that while we are only people, we’ve got to take the world that’s given—because there isn’t any other.’
“你看，我的爱人，”她说，“我很害怕，虽然我们只是人，但我们必须接受所给予的世界——因为没有其他的了。”

‘Yes there is,’ he said. ‘There’s somewhere where we can be free—somewhere where one needn’t wear much clothes—none even—where one meets a few people who have gone through enough, and can take things for granted—where you be yourself, without bothering. There is somewhere—there are one or two people—‘
“是的，有，”他说。 “有一个地方，我们可以自由自在，不需要穿太多衣服，甚至不需要穿太多衣服，遇到几个经历过足够多的人，可以把一切视为理所当然，在那里你可以做你自己，不用费心。某个地方——有一两个人——”

‘But where—?’ she sighed.
“但是在哪里——？”她叹了口气。

‘Somewhere—anywhere. Let’s wander off. That’s the thing to do—let’s wander off.’
‘某处——任何地方。我们去流浪吧。这就是要做的事——我们走吧。

‘Yes—‘ she said, thrilled at the thought of travel. But to her it was only travel.
“是的——”她说，一想到旅行就兴奋不已。但对她来说，这只是旅行。

‘To be free,’ he said. ‘To be free, in a free place, with a few other people!’
“为了自由，”他说。 “要自由，在一个自由的地方，和其他几个人在一起！”

‘Yes,’ she said wistfully. Those ‘few other people’ depressed her.
“是的，”她若有所思地说。那些“少数人”让她感到沮丧。

‘It isn’t really a locality, though,’ he said. ‘It’s a perfected relation between you and me, and others—the perfect relation—so that we are free together.’
“不过，这并不是一个真正的地方，”他说。 “这是你和我以及其他人之间完美的关系——完美的关系——这样我们才能在一起自由。”

‘It is, my love, isn’t it,’ she said. ‘It’s you and me. It’s you and me, isn’t it?’ She stretched out her arms to him. He went across and stooped to kiss her face. Her arms closed round him again, her hands spread upon his shoulders, moving slowly there, moving slowly on his back, down his back slowly, with a strange recurrent, rhythmic motion, yet moving slowly down, pressing mysteriously over his loins, over his flanks. The sense of the awfulness of riches that could never be impaired flooded her mind like a swoon, a death in most marvellous possession, mystic-sure. She possessed him so utterly and intolerably, that she herself lapsed out. And yet she was only sitting still in the chair, with her hands pressed upon him, and lost.
“是的，亲爱的，不是吗，”她说。 '是你和我。是你和我，不是吗？”她向他伸出双臂。他走过去，弯下腰亲吻她的脸。她的双臂再次环住他，双手摊在他的肩膀上，慢慢地移动到那里，慢慢地移动到他的背上，慢慢地向下移动，以一种奇怪的、反复的、有节奏的动作，但又缓慢地向下移动，神秘地压在他的腰上，压在他的背上。侧翼。财富永远不会受到损害，这种可怕的感觉像昏厥一样充斥着她的脑海，一种最奇妙的财产的死亡，神秘的确定。她完全地、难以忍受地占有了他，以至于她自己也迷失了。然而她只是一动不动地坐在椅子上，双手按在他身上，茫然若失。

Again he softly kissed her.
他再次轻轻地吻了她。

‘We shall never go apart again,’ he murmured quietly. And she did not speak, but only pressed her hands firmer down upon the source of darkness in him.
“我们再也不会分开了。”他低声说道。她没有说话，只是将双手更加用力地按在他内心黑暗的源头上。

They decided, when they woke again from the pure swoon, to write their resignations from the world of work there and then. She wanted this.
当他们从纯粹的昏迷中再次醒来时，他们决定当场写下辞职信。她想要这个。

He rang the bell, and ordered note-paper without a printed address. The waiter cleared the table.
他按响了门铃，订购了一张没有打印地址的便条纸。服务员清理了桌子。

‘Now then,’ he said, ‘yours first. Put your home address, and the date—then ‘Director of Education, Town Hall—Sir—‘ Now then!—I don’t know how one really stands—I suppose one could get out of it in less than month—Anyhow ‘Sir—I beg to resign my post as classmistress in the Willey Green Grammar School. I should be very grateful if you would liberate me as soon as possible, without waiting for the expiration of the month’s notice.’ That’ll do. Have you got it? Let me look. ‘Ursula Brangwen.’ Good! Now I’ll write mine. I ought to give them three months, but I can plead health. I can arrange it all right.’
“那么，”他说，“首先是你的。”写上你的家庭住址，还有日期——然后是“市政厅教育主任——先生——”那么现在！——我不知道一个人的真实情况如何——我想一个人可以在不到一个月的时间内摆脱它——无论如何”先生——我请求辞去威利·格林文法学校班主任的职务。如果你能尽快释放我，而不用等到这个月的通知期满，我将非常感激。’就可以了。你明白了吗？让我看看。 “乌苏拉·布兰文。”好！现在我来写我的。我应该给他们三个月的时间，但我可以以健康为由。我可以安排好。

He sat and wrote out his formal resignation.
他坐下来写下了正式的辞呈。

‘Now,’ he said, when the envelopes were sealed and addressed, ‘shall we post them here, both together? I know Jackie will say, ‘Here’s a coincidence!’ when he receives them in all their identity. Shall we let him say it, or not?’
“现在，”当信封被密封并写好地址后，他说道，“我们可以把它们一起寄到这里吗？”我知道当杰基收到他们的全部身份时，他会说：“这真是巧合！”我们让他说还是不说？

‘I don’t care,’ she said.
“我不在乎，”她说。

‘No—?’ he said, pondering.
“不——？”他沉思着说道。

‘It doesn’t matter, does it?’ she said.
“没关系，不是吗？”她说。

‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘Their imaginations shall not work on us. I’ll post yours here, mine after. I cannot be implicated in their imaginings.’
“是的，”他回答道。 ‘他们的想象力对我们不起作用。我会在这里发布你的，之后是我的。我不能参与他们的想象。

He looked at her with his strange, non-human singleness.
他用一种奇怪的、非人类的孤独看着她。

‘Yes, you are right,’ she said.
“是的，你是对的，”她说。

She lifted her face to him, all shining and open. It was as if he might enter straight into the source of her radiance. His face became a little distracted.
她抬起头来面对他，脸庞明亮而开放。仿佛可以直接进入她光芒的源头。他的脸色变得有些心不在焉。

‘Shall we go?’ he said.
“我们走吧？”他说。

‘As you like,’ she replied.
“随你喜欢，”她回答道。

They were soon out of the little town, and running through the uneven lanes of the country. Ursula nestled near him, into his constant warmth, and watched the pale-lit revelation racing ahead, the visible night. Sometimes it was a wide old road, with grass-spaces on either side, flying magic and elfin in the greenish illumination, sometimes it was trees looming overhead, sometimes it was bramble bushes, sometimes the walls of a crew-yard and the butt of a barn.
他们很快就出了小镇，跑过乡村崎岖不平的小巷。乌苏拉依偎在他身边，沉浸在他持续不断的温暖之中，看着前方那昏暗的灯光和可见的夜晚。有时是一条宽阔的老路，两边都是草地，在绿色的灯光下飞翔的魔法和精灵，有时是树木在头顶若隐若现，有时是荆棘丛，有时是船员船坞的墙壁和船尾。一个谷仓。

‘Are you going to Shortlands to dinner?’ Ursula asked him suddenly. He started.
“你要去肖特兰兹吃晚饭吗？”乌苏拉突然问他。他开始。

‘Good God!’ he said. ‘Shortlands! Never again. Not that. Besides we should be too late.’
“天哪！”他说。 ‘肖特兰兹！再也不。不是那个。而且我们应该来得太晚了。

‘Where are we going then—to the Mill?’
“那我们要去哪儿——去磨坊？”

‘If you like. Pity to go anywhere on this good dark night. Pity to come out of it, really. Pity we can’t stop in the good darkness. It is better than anything ever would be—this good immediate darkness.’
'如果你喜欢。可惜在这个美好的黑夜去任何地方。遗憾的是，真的。可惜我们不能在美好的黑暗中停下来。这比任何事情都要好——这美好的眼前的黑暗。

She sat wondering. The car lurched and swayed. She knew there was no leaving him, the darkness held them both and contained them, it was not to be surpassed Besides she had a full mystic knowledge of his suave loins of darkness, dark-clad and suave, and in this knowledge there was some of the inevitability and the beauty of fate, fate which one asks for, which one accepts in full.
她坐着思考。车子摇摇欲坠。她知道他无法离开，黑暗抓住了他们，包容了他们，这是不可超越的。此外，她对他温柔的黑暗腰部有着完全神秘的认识，穿着黑暗，温文尔雅，在这种认识中，有一些命运的必然性和美丽，人们所要求的命运，人们完全接受的命运。

He sat still like an Egyptian Pharoah, driving the car. He felt as if he were seated in immemorial potency, like the great carven statues of real Egypt, as real and as fulfilled with subtle strength, as these are, with a vague inscrutable smile on the lips. He knew what it was to have the strange and magical current of force in his back and loins, and down his legs, force so perfect that it stayed him immobile, and left his face subtly, mindlessly smiling. He knew what it was to be awake and potent in that other basic mind, the deepest physical mind. And from this source he had a pure and magic control, magical, mystical, a force in darkness, like electricity.
他像埃及法老一样一动不动地坐着，驾驶着汽车。他感觉自己仿佛坐在远古的力量中，就像真正埃及的巨大雕刻雕像一样，真实而充满微妙的力量，就像这些一样，嘴唇上带着模糊的、难以理解的微笑。他知道在他的背部和腰部以及双腿上有一股奇怪而神奇的力量是什么感觉，力量如此完美，以至于让他一动不动，脸上留下了微妙的、漫不经心的微笑。他知道在另一个基本心灵、最深层的肉体心灵中保持清醒和强大意味着什么。从这个源头，他拥有了一种纯粹而神奇的控制力，神奇，神秘，黑暗中的力量，就像电力一样。

It was very difficult to speak, it was so perfect to sit in this pure living silence, subtle, full of unthinkable knowledge and unthinkable force, upheld immemorially in timeless force, like the immobile, supremely potent Egyptians, seated forever in their living, subtle silence.
很难说话，坐在这纯粹的、生机勃勃的寂静中是那么完美，微妙，充满了难以想象的知识和不可思议的力量，在永恒的力量中永恒地支撑着，就像不动的、极其强大的埃及人一样，永远坐在他们生机勃勃的、微妙的之中。安静。

‘We need not go home,’ he said. ‘This car has seats that let down and make a bed, and we can lift the hood.’
“我们不需要回家，”他说。 “这辆车的座椅可以放倒，可以当床，我们可以打开引擎盖。”

She was glad and frightened. She cowered near to him.
她又高兴又害怕。她畏缩靠近他。

‘But what about them at home?’ she said.
“但是他们在家里呢？”她说。

‘Send a telegram.’
'致电。'

Nothing more was said. They ran on in silence. But with a sort of second consciousness he steered the car towards a destination. For he had the free intelligence to direct his own ends. His arms and his breast and his head were rounded and living like those of the Greek, he had not the unawakened straight arms of the Egyptian, nor the sealed, slumbering head. A lambent intelligence played secondarily above his pure Egyptian concentration in darkness.
没有再说什么。他们默默地跑着。但凭借着第二意识，他把车开向了目的地。因为他拥有自由的智慧来指导自己的目标。他的手臂、胸部和头部都是圆形的，像希腊人一样生动，他没有埃及人那种未苏醒的笔直手臂，也没有封闭的、沉睡的头部。与他在黑暗中纯正的埃及式专注相比，隐隐约约的智慧是次要的。

They came to a village that lined along the road. The car crept slowly along, until he saw the post-office. Then he pulled up.
他们来到了路边的一个村庄。汽车缓缓前行，直到他看到了邮局。然后他停了下来。

‘I will send a telegram to your father,’ he said. ‘I will merely say ‘spending the night in town,’ shall I?’
“我会给你父亲发一封电报，”他说。 “我只会说‘在城里过夜’，可以吗？”

‘Yes,’ she answered. She did not want to be disturbed into taking thought.
“是的，”她回答。她不想被打扰去思考。

She watched him move into the post-office. It was also a shop, she saw. Strange, he was. Even as he went into the lighted, public place he remained dark and magic, the living silence seemed the body of reality in him, subtle, potent, indiscoverable. There he was! In a strange uplift of elation she saw him, the being never to be revealed, awful in its potency, mystic and real. This dark, subtle reality of him, never to be translated, liberated her into perfection, her own perfected being. She too was dark and fulfilled in silence.
她看着他走进邮局。她看到，这也是一家商店。奇怪的是，他确实如此。即使当他走进灯火通明的公共场所时，他仍然是黑暗而神奇的，生机勃勃的寂静似乎是他内心的现实，微妙、有力、难以发现。他在那儿！在一种奇怪的兴奋中，她看到了他，这个永远不会被揭露的存在，其力量可怕，神秘而真实。他的这种黑暗、微妙的现实，永远无法被翻译，将她解放到完美，她自己完美的存在。她也是黑暗的，在沉默中感到满足。

He came out, throwing some packages into the car.
他出来了，把一些包裹扔进了车里。

‘There is some bread, and cheese, and raisins, and apples, and hard chocolate,’ he said, in his voice that was as if laughing, because of the unblemished stillness and force which was the reality in him. She would have to touch him. To speak, to see, was nothing. It was a travesty to look and to comprehend the man there. Darkness and silence must fall perfectly on her, then she could know mystically, in unrevealed touch. She must lightly, mindlessly connect with him, have the knowledge which is death of knowledge, the reality of surety in not-knowing.
“有一些面包、奶酪、葡萄干、苹果和硬巧克力，”他说，他的声音仿佛在笑，因为他身上的真实是完美的宁静和力量。她必须碰触他。说话，看，都不算什么。观察和理解那里的那个人真是一种讽刺。黑暗和寂静必须完美地降临到她身上，然后她才能神秘地、以不显露的触感知道。她必须轻轻地、无意识地与他联系，拥有知识的死亡、未知中的确定性现实。

Soon they had run on again into the darkness. She did not ask where they were going, she did not care. She sat in a fullness and a pure potency that was like apathy, mindless and immobile. She was next to him, and hung in a pure rest, as a star is hung, balanced unthinkably. Still there remained a dark lambency of anticipation. She would touch him. With perfect fine finger-tips of reality she would touch the reality in him, the suave, pure, untranslatable reality of his loins of darkness. To touch, mindlessly in darkness to come in pure touching upon the living reality of him, his suave perfect loins and thighs of darkness, this was her sustaining anticipation.
很快他们又跑进了黑暗中。她没有问他们要去哪里，她不在乎。她坐在那里，充满了纯粹的力量，就像冷漠、无意识、一动不动。她就在他旁边，纯粹地休息着，就像一颗星星悬挂着一样，平衡得不可思议。仍然有一种阴暗而温柔的期待。她会触碰他。她会用现实的完美指尖触碰他内心的现实，他黑暗腰部的温文尔雅、纯粹、不可翻译的现实。在黑暗中漫不经心地触摸，纯粹地触摸他的活生生的现实，他温柔完美的腰部和黑暗的大腿，这是她持续的期待。

And he too waited in the magical steadfastness of suspense, for her to take this knowledge of him as he had taken it of her. He knew her darkly, with the fullness of dark knowledge. Now she would know him, and he too would be liberated. He would be night-free, like an Egyptian, steadfast in perfectly suspended equilibrium, pure mystic nodality of physical being. They would give each other this star-equilibrium which alone is freedom.
他也在悬念中神奇而坚定地等待着，等待她了解他，就像他了解她一样。他对她有深刻的了解，有着丰富的黑暗知识。现在她会认识他，他也会得到解放。他将像埃及人一样摆脱夜晚的束缚，坚定地处于完全悬浮的平衡状态，身体存在的纯粹神秘的节点性。他们会给彼此这种星形平衡，这本身就是自由。

She saw that they were running among trees—great old trees with dying bracken undergrowth. The palish, gnarled trunks showed ghostly, and like old priests in the hovering distance, the fern rose magical and mysterious. It was a night all darkness, with low cloud. The motor-car advanced slowly.
她看到他们在树林中奔跑——高大的老树，灌木丛中长着快要枯死的蕨类植物。苍白、多节的树干显得幽灵般，就像远处盘旋的老祭司一样，蕨类植物的玫瑰神奇而神秘。那是一个漆黑的夜晚，云层很低。汽车缓缓前行。

‘Where are we?’ she whispered.
“我们在哪儿？”她低声问道。

‘In Sherwood Forest.’
“在舍伍德森林。”

It was evident he knew the place. He drove softly, watching. Then they came to a green road between the trees. They turned cautiously round, and were advancing between the oaks of the forest, down a green lane. The green lane widened into a little circle of grass, where there was a small trickle of water at the bottom of a sloping bank. The car stopped.
显然他知道这个地方。他轻轻地开车，注视着。然后他们来到了树林间的一条绿道。他们小心翼翼地转身，沿着一条绿色的小路，在森林的橡树间前进。绿色的小路变宽，变成了一小圈草地，坡岸的底部有一小股水流。车停了。

‘We will stay here,’ he said, ‘and put out the lights.’
“我们会留在这里，”他说，“然后熄灭灯。”

He extinguished the lamps at once, and it was pure night, with shadows of trees like realities of other, nightly being. He threw a rug on to the bracken, and they sat in stillness and mindless silence. There were faint sounds from the wood, but no disturbance, no possible disturbance, the world was under a strange ban, a new mystery had supervened. They threw off their clothes, and he gathered her to him, and found her, found the pure lambent reality of her forever invisible flesh. Quenched, inhuman, his fingers upon her unrevealed nudity were the fingers of silence upon silence, the body of mysterious night upon the body of mysterious night, the night masculine and feminine, never to be seen with the eye, or known with the mind, only known as a palpable revelation of living otherness.
他立即熄灭了灯，这是纯净的夜晚，树影如其他夜间存在的现实。他在蕨菜上铺了一块地毯，他们静静地坐着，没有任何动静。树林里传来微弱的声音，但没有扰动，不可能有扰动，世界处于一种奇怪的禁制之下，新的谜团随之而来。他们脱掉了衣服，他把她聚集到他身边，找到了她，找到了她永远看不见的肉体的纯洁、柔和的现实。他的手指冷酷地、非人性地压在她未显露的裸体上，是沉默之上的手指，是神秘之夜的身体之上的神秘之夜的身体，夜晚的男性和女性，永远无法用眼睛看到，也不能用头脑了解，只被认为是对活生生的差异性的明显揭示。

She had her desire of him, she touched, she received the maximum of unspeakable communication in touch, dark, subtle, positively silent, a magnificent gift and give again, a perfect acceptance and yielding, a mystery, the reality of that which can never be known, vital, sensual reality that can never be transmuted into mind content, but remains outside, living body of darkness and silence and subtlety, the mystic body of reality. She had her desire fulfilled. He had his desire fulfilled. For she was to him what he was to her, the immemorial magnificence of mystic, palpable, real otherness.
她对他有渴望，她感动，她在触摸中接受了最大程度的难以言表的交流，黑暗，微妙，完全沉默，一份宏伟的礼物和再次给予，一次完美的接受和屈服，一个神秘，永远无法实现的现实。众所周知，生机勃勃的感性现实永远无法转化为心灵内容，但仍然存在于外部，是黑暗、沉默和微妙的生命体，是现实的神秘体。她的愿望实现了。他的愿望实现了。因为她之于他就像他之于她一样，是远古的壮丽，神秘、明显、真实的差异。

They slept the chilly night through under the hood of the car, a night of unbroken sleep. It was already high day when he awoke. They looked at each other and laughed, then looked away, filled with darkness and secrecy. Then they kissed and remembered the magnificence of the night. It was so magnificent, such an inheritance of a universe of dark reality, that they were afraid to seem to remember. They hid away the remembrance and the knowledge.
寒冷的夜晚，他们在汽车引擎盖下睡了一觉，一夜无间。当他醒来时，已经是大白天了。他们相视一笑，然后移开视线，充满了黑暗和秘密。然后他们接吻并回忆起那晚的壮丽。这是如此宏伟，如此黑暗现实宇宙的遗产，以至于他们似乎不敢记住。他们隐藏了记忆和知识。

CHAPTER XXIV
第二十四章

DEATH AND LOVE
死亡与爱

Thomas Crich died slowly, terribly slowly. It seemed impossible to everybody that the thread of life could be drawn out so thin, and yet not break. The sick man lay unutterably weak and spent, kept alive by morphia and by drinks, which he sipped slowly. He was only half conscious—a thin strand of consciousness linking the darkness of death with the light of day. Yet his will was unbroken, he was integral, complete. Only he must have perfect stillness about him.
托马斯·克里奇死得很慢，慢得可怕。对每个人来说，生命之线能被拉得这么细，却又不断裂，似乎是不可能的。病人躺在那里，极度虚弱，精疲力尽，靠吗啡和饮料维持生命，他慢慢地喝着饮料。他只有半知觉——一条细细的意识将死亡的黑暗与白天的光明联系起来。然而他的意志是完整的，他是完整的，完整的。只有他必须保持完全的静止。

Any presence but that of the nurses was a strain and an effort to him now. Every morning Gerald went into the room, hoping to find his father passed away at last. Yet always he saw the same transparent face, the same dread dark hair on the waxen forehead, and the awful, inchoate dark eyes, which seemed to be decomposing into formless darkness, having only a tiny grain of vision within them.
现在，除了护士之外，任何人的存在对他来说都是一种压力和努力。每天早上杰拉德都会走进房间，希望看到他的父亲终于去世了。但他总是看到那张同样透明的脸，蜡质额头上同样可怕的黑发，还有那双可怕的、未成熟的黑眼睛，它们似乎正在分解成无形的黑暗，里面只有一点点的视觉。

And always, as the dark, inchoate eyes turned to him, there passed through Gerald’s bowels a burning stroke of revolt, that seemed to resound through his whole being, threatening to break his mind with its clangour, and making him mad.
当那双漆黑的、稚嫩的眼睛转向他时，杰拉德的内心深处总会涌起一股强烈的反抗之情，似乎在他的全身上下回响，威胁要以其铿锵声击碎他的心智，让他发疯。

Every morning, the son stood there, erect and taut with life, gleaming in his blondness. The gleaming blondness of his strange, imminent being put the father into a fever of fretful irritation. He could not bear to meet the uncanny, downward look of Gerald’s blue eyes. But it was only for a moment. Each on the brink of departure, the father and son looked at each other, then parted.
每天早上，儿子都站在那里，身体笔直，充满活力，金发闪闪发光。他即将到来的奇怪的、闪闪发光的金发让父亲陷入了烦躁的愤怒之中。他无法忍受看到杰拉尔德那双蓝眼睛里那种怪异、向下的神情。但这只是一瞬间。临走之际，父子俩对视一眼，便分别了。

For a long time Gerald preserved a perfect sang froid, he remained quite collected. But at last, fear undermined him. He was afraid of some horrible collapse in himself. He had to stay and see this thing through. Some perverse will made him watch his father drawn over the borders of life. And yet, now, every day, the great red-hot stroke of horrified fear through the bowels of the son struck a further inflammation. Gerald went about all day with a tendency to cringe, as if there were the point of a sword of Damocles pricking the nape of his neck.
很长一段时间以来，杰拉尔德都保持着完美的冷静，他始终保持镇定。但最终，恐惧击垮了他。他害怕自己会发生可怕的崩溃。他必须留下来看看这件事。某种反常的意志使他眼睁睁地看着他的父亲被拉过生命的界限。然而，现在，每一天，巨大的恐惧感都在儿子的肠子里袭来，引发了进一步的炎症。杰拉尔德一整天都带着畏缩的倾向，仿佛有一把达摩克利斯之剑的剑尖刺在他的颈背上。

There was no escape—he was bound up with his father, he had to see him through. And the father’s will never relaxed or yielded to death. It would have to snap when death at last snapped it,—if it did not persist after a physical death. In the same way, the will of the son never yielded. He stood firm and immune, he was outside this death and this dying.
没有办法逃脱——他和他的父亲息息相关，他必须陪他渡过难关。而父亲的意志决不会放松或屈服于死亡。当死亡最终折断它时，如果它在肉体死亡后不继续存在的话，它就必须折断。同样，儿子的意志也从未屈服。他坚定地站着，免疫着，他置身于这种死亡和垂死之外。

It was a trial by ordeal. Could he stand and see his father slowly dissolve and disappear in death, without once yielding his will, without once relenting before the omnipotence of death. Like a Red Indian undergoing torture, Gerald would experience the whole process of slow death without wincing or flinching. He even triumphed in it. He somehow WANTED this death, even forced it. It was as if he himself were dealing the death, even when he most recoiled in horror. Still, he would deal it, he would triumph through death.
这是一场严酷的考验。他能否站着，看着父亲在死亡中慢慢溶解、消失，在死亡的无所不能面前，没有一次屈服，没有一次屈服。就像一个正在遭受酷刑的红印第安人一样，杰拉尔德会经历缓慢死亡的整个过程，而不会畏缩或退缩。他甚至还取得了胜利。他不知何故想要这样的死亡，甚至强迫它。就好像他自己正在处理死亡，即使是在他最害怕的时候。尽管如此，他还是会解决这个问题，他会战胜死亡。

But in the stress of this ordeal, Gerald too lost his hold on the outer, daily life. That which was much to him, came to mean nothing. Work, pleasure—it was all left behind. He went on more or less mechanically with his business, but this activity was all extraneous. The real activity was this ghastly wrestling for death in his own soul. And his own will should triumph. Come what might, he would not bow down or submit or acknowledge a master. He had no master in death.
但在这场磨难的压力下，杰拉德也失去了对外在日常生活的控制。对他来说很重要的事情变得毫无意义。工作、娱乐——统统抛在了脑后。他或多或少机械地继续着他的生意，但这项活动完全是无关紧要的。真正的活动是他自己灵魂中为死亡而进行的可怕的角力。他自己的意志应该获胜。无论发生什么情况，他都不会跪拜、屈服或承认主人。他没有死亡的主人。

But as the fight went on, and all that he had been and was continued to be destroyed, so that life was a hollow shell all round him, roaring and clattering like the sound of the sea, a noise in which he participated externally, and inside this hollow shell was all the darkness and fearful space of death, he knew he would have to find reinforcements, otherwise he would collapse inwards upon the great dark void which circled at the centre of his soul. His will held his outer life, his outer mind, his outer being unbroken and unchanged. But the pressure was too great. He would have to find something to make good the equilibrium. Something must come with him into the hollow void of death in his soul, fill it up, and so equalise the pressure within to the pressure without. For day by day he felt more and more like a bubble filled with darkness, round which whirled the iridescence of his consciousness, and upon which the pressure of the outer world, the outer life, roared vastly.
但随着战斗的继续，他过去和现在的一切都在继续被摧毁，所以他周围的生命变成了一个空壳，像大海的声音一样咆哮和碰撞，这是一种他从外部参与的噪音，并且这个空壳里面充满了黑暗和可怕的死亡空间，他知道自己必须找到援军，否则他就会向内崩溃，陷入环绕在他灵魂中心的巨大黑暗虚空之中。他的意志保持着他的外在生活、他的外在思想、他的外在存在不被破坏和不变。但压力太大了。他必须找到一些东西来改善平衡。必须有某种东西伴随他进入他灵魂中死亡的空洞，将其填满，从而平衡内部的压力与外部的压力。日复一日，他感觉自己越来越像一个充满黑暗的泡沫，他意识的彩虹色围绕着泡沫旋转，外部世界、外部生命的压力在泡沫上咆哮。

In this extremity his instinct led him to Gudrun. He threw away everything now—he only wanted the relation established with her. He would follow her to the studio, to be near her, to talk to her. He would stand about the room, aimlessly picking up the implements, the lumps of clay, the little figures she had cast—they were whimsical and grotesque—looking at them without perceiving them. And she felt him following her, dogging her heels like a doom. She held away from him, and yet she knew he drew always a little nearer, a little nearer.
在这种绝境中，他的本能把他引向了古德伦。他现在已经抛开了一切——他只想和她建立关系。他会跟着她去工作室，靠近她，和她说话。他会站在房间周围，漫无目的地捡起工具、粘土块、她铸造的小人物——它们异想天开、怪诞——看着它们却没有意识到它们。她感觉到他在追随她，像厄运一样紧追不舍。她远离他，但她知道他总是靠近一点，再靠近一点。

‘I say,’ he said to her one evening, in an odd, unthinking, uncertain way, ‘won’t you stay to dinner tonight? I wish you would.’
“我说，”有一天晚上，他用一种奇怪的、不假思索的、不确定的方式对她说，“你今晚不留下来吃晚饭吗？”我希望你能。'

She started slightly. He spoke to her like a man making a request of another man.
她微微一惊。他对她说话就像一个男人向另一个男人提出要求。

‘They’ll be expecting me at home,’ she said.
“他们会在家里等我，”她说。

‘Oh, they won’t mind, will they?’ he said. ‘I should be awfully glad if you’d stay.’
“哦，他们不会介意的，不是吗？”他说。 “如果你留下来，我会非常高兴。”

Her long silence gave consent at last.
她长久的沉默最终表示同意。

‘I’ll tell Thomas, shall I?’ he said.
“我会告诉托马斯，可以吗？”他说。

‘I must go almost immediately after dinner,’ she said.
“晚饭后我几乎必须立即出发，”她说。

It was a dark, cold evening. There was no fire in the drawing-room, they sat in the library. He was mostly silent, absent, and Winifred talked little. But when Gerald did rouse himself, he smiled and was pleasant and ordinary with her. Then there came over him again the long blanks, of which he was not aware.
那是一个漆黑、寒冷的夜晚。客厅里没有生火，他们坐在书房里。他大部分时间都很沉默，心不在焉，威妮弗雷德也很少说话。但当杰拉尔德真正醒来时，他微笑着，对她表现得愉快而平常。然后，他没有意识到，又出现了长长的空白。

She was very much attracted by him. He looked so preoccupied, and his strange, blank silences, which she could not read, moved her and made her wonder over him, made her feel reverential towards him.
她非常被他吸引。他看起来那么专注，他奇怪的、空白的沉默让她无法解读，却让她感动，让她对他产生好奇，让她对他产生敬畏之情。

But he was very kind. He gave her the best things at the table, he had a bottle of slightly sweet, delicious golden wine brought out for dinner, knowing she would prefer it to the burgundy. She felt herself esteemed, needed almost.
但他非常善良。他给了她餐桌上最好的东西，他为晚餐准备了一瓶微甜可口的金葡萄酒，他知道她会更喜欢它而不是勃艮第。她觉得自己受到尊重，几乎被需要。

As they took coffee in the library, there was a soft, very soft knocking at the door. He started, and called ‘Come in.’ The timbre of his voice, like something vibrating at high pitch, unnerved Gudrun. A nurse in white entered, half hovering in the doorway like a shadow. She was very good-looking, but strangely enough, shy and self-mistrusting.
当他们在图书馆喝咖啡时，门外响起了轻轻的、非常轻的敲门声。他吃了一惊，喊道：“请进。”他声音的音色就像是高音振动的东西，让古德伦感到不安。一名白衣护士走了进来，半个身形在门口徘徊，如影子一般。她长得很漂亮，但奇怪的是，她很害羞，而且不自信。

‘The doctor would like to speak to you, Mr Crich,’ she said, in her low, discreet voice.
“医生想和你谈谈，克里奇先生，”她用低沉、谨慎的声音说道。

‘The doctor!’ he said, starting up. ‘Where is he?’
“医生！”他惊恐地说道。 '他在哪里？'

‘He is in the dining-room.’
“他在餐厅里。”

‘Tell him I’m coming.’
“告诉他我来了。”

He drank up his coffee, and followed the nurse, who had dissolved like a shadow.
他喝完咖啡，跟着护士，她已经像影子一样消失了。

‘Which nurse was that?’ asked Gudrun.
“那是哪位护士？”古德伦问。

‘Miss Inglis—I like her best,’ replied Winifred.
“英格利斯小姐——我最喜欢她，”威妮弗雷德回答道。

After a while Gerald came back, looking absorbed by his own thoughts, and having some of that tension and abstraction which is seen in a slightly drunken man. He did not say what the doctor had wanted him for, but stood before the fire, with his hands behind his back, and his face open and as if rapt. Not that he was really thinking—he was only arrested in pure suspense inside himself, and thoughts wafted through his mind without order.
过了一会儿，杰拉尔德回来了，看上去全神贯注于自己的思绪，带着一些轻微醉酒的人所表现出的紧张和心不在焉的神情。他没有说医生要他做什么，只是站在火堆前，双手背在身后，面无表情，仿佛全神贯注。他并不是真的在思考——他只是陷入了内心的纯粹悬念之中，思绪无序地在他的脑海中飘荡。

‘I must go now and see Mama,’ said Winifred, ‘and see Dadda before he goes to sleep.’
“我现在必须去见妈妈，”威妮弗雷德说，“并在爸爸睡觉前见见他。”

She bade them both good-night.
她向他们俩道晚安。

Gudrun also rose to take her leave.
古珍也起身告辞。

‘You needn’t go yet, need you?’ said Gerald, glancing quickly at the clock.’ It is early yet. I’ll walk down with you when you go. Sit down, don’t hurry away.’
“你还不用走，是吗？”杰拉尔德说，快速地看了一眼时钟。“时间还早。”你走的时候我会和你一起走下去。坐下吧，别急着走。”

Gudrun sat down, as if, absent as he was, his will had power over her. She felt almost mesmerised. He was strange to her, something unknown. What was he thinking, what was he feeling, as he stood there so rapt, saying nothing? He kept her—she could feel that. He would not let her go. She watched him in humble submissiveness.
古德伦坐了下来，尽管他心不在焉，但他的意志却对她有控制力。她感觉自己几乎被迷住了。他对她来说很陌生，有些陌生。当他全神贯注地站在那里，一言不发时，他在想什么，他在想什么？他保留了她——她能感觉到。他不会让她走。她谦卑地顺从地看着他。

‘Had the doctor anything new to tell you?’ she asked, softly, at length, with that gentle, timid sympathy which touched a keen fibre in his heart. He lifted his eyebrows with a negligent, indifferent expression.
“医生有什么新的事情要告诉你吗？”她最后轻轻地问，带着温柔、胆怯的同情，触动了他内心敏锐的神经。他扬起眉毛，表情漫不经心、漠不关心。

‘No—nothing new,’ he replied, as if the question were quite casual, trivial. ‘He says the pulse is very weak indeed, very intermittent—but that doesn’t necessarily mean much, you know.’
“不——没什么新鲜事，”他回答道，好像这个问题很随意、微不足道。 “他说脉搏确实非常微弱，非常断断续续——但这并不一定意味着什么，你知道。”

He looked down at her. Her eyes were dark and soft and unfolded, with a stricken look that roused him.
他低头看着她。她的眼睛漆黑、柔和，睁开，带着一种震惊的神情，让他惊醒。

‘No,’ she murmured at length. ‘I don’t understand anything about these things.’
“不，”她终于低声说道。 “我对这些事情一无所知。”

‘Just as well not,’ he said. ‘I say, won’t you have a cigarette?—do!’ He quickly fetched the box, and held her a light. Then he stood before her on the hearth again.
“也罢，”他说。 “我说，你不抽支烟吗？——抽吧！”他迅速拿起盒子，给她点了一支火。然后他又站在她面前的壁炉边。

‘No,’ he said, ‘we’ve never had much illness in the house, either—not till father.’ He seemed to meditate a while. Then looking down at her, with strangely communicative blue eyes, that filled her with dread, he continued: ‘It’s something you don’t reckon with, you know, till it is there. And then you realise that it was there all the time—it was always there—you understand what I mean?—the possibility of this incurable illness, this slow death.’
“不，”他说，“我们家里也从来没有生过什么大病——直到父亲。”他似乎沉思了一会儿。然后他低头看着她，那双蓝眼睛奇怪地善于交流，让她充满了恐惧，他继续说道：“你知道，这是一种你不会想到的东西，直到它出现为止。”然后你意识到它一直在那里——它一直在那里——你明白我的意思吗？——这种不治之症的可能性，这种缓慢的死亡。

He moved his feet uneasily on the marble hearth, and put his cigarette to his mouth, looking up at the ceiling.
他在大理石壁炉上不安地移动着双脚，把香烟放到嘴边，抬头看着天花板。

‘I know,’ murmured Gudrun: ‘it is dreadful.’
“我知道，”古德伦低声说道，“这太可怕了。”

He smoked without knowing. Then he took the cigarette from his lips, bared his teeth, and putting the tip of his tongue between his teeth spat off a grain of tobacco, turning slightly aside, like a man who is alone, or who is lost in thought.
他在不知情的情况下抽烟。然后他从嘴边取下香烟，龇牙咧嘴，用舌尖咬着牙，吐出一粒烟丝，微微侧身，像一个孤独的人，或者陷入沉思的人。

‘I don’t know what the effect actually IS, on one,’ he said, and again he looked down at her. Her eyes were dark and stricken with knowledge, looking into his. He saw her submerged, and he turned aside his face. ‘But I absolutely am not the same. There’s nothing left, if you understand what I mean. You seem to be clutching at the void—and at the same time you are void yourself. And so you don’t know what to DO.’
“我不知道这对一个人来说到底有什么影响，”他说，然后再次低头看着她。她的眼睛漆黑，充满知识，看着他的眼睛。他看到她被淹没了，他把脸扭到一边。 ‘但我绝对不一样。如果你明白我的意思的话，就什么都没有剩下了。你似乎抓住了空虚——而同时你自己也是空虚的。所以你不知道该怎么办。

‘No,’ she murmured. A heavy thrill ran down her nerves, heavy, almost pleasure, almost pain. ‘What can be done?’ she added.
“不，”她低声说。一种沉重的颤栗顺着她的神经流过，沉重，几乎是快乐，几乎是痛苦。 “能做什么？”她补充道。

He turned, and flipped the ash from his cigarette on to the great marble hearth-stones, that lay bare in the room, without fender or bar.
他转过身，把烟灰弹到房间里光秃秃的大理石炉石上，没有挡泥板或栏杆。

‘I don’t know, I’m sure,’ he replied. ‘But I do think you’ve got to find some way of resolving the situation—not because you want to, but because you’ve GOT to, otherwise you’re done. The whole of everything, and yourself included, is just on the point of caving in, and you are just holding it up with your hands. Well, it’s a situation that obviously can’t continue. You can’t stand holding the roof up with your hands, for ever. You know that sooner or later you’ll HAVE to let go. Do you understand what I mean? And so something’s got to be done, or there’s a universal collapse—as far as you yourself are concerned.’
“我不知道，但我确定，”他回答道。 “但我确实认为你必须找到某种方法来解决这个问题——不是因为你想这么做，而是因为你必须这么做，否则你就完了。”整个一切，包括你自己，都快要崩溃了，而你只是用手把它举起来。嗯，这种情况显然不能再持续下去了。你无法永远忍受用手撑起屋顶。你知道迟早你必须放手。你明白我的意思吗？因此必须采取一些措施，否则就会出现普遍崩溃——就你自己而言。”

He shifted slightly on the hearth, crunching a cinder under his heel. He looked down at it. Gudrun was aware of the beautiful old marble panels of the fireplace, swelling softly carved, round him and above him. She felt as if she were caught at last by fate, imprisoned in some horrible and fatal trap.
他在壁炉上轻轻动了动，脚后跟踩碎了煤渣。他低头看着它。古德伦注意到壁炉上美丽的古老大理石面板，在他周围和上方都经过柔和的雕刻。她感觉自己好像终于被命运抓住了，被囚禁在一个可怕而致命的陷阱里。

‘But what CAN be done?’ she murmured humbly. ‘You must use me if I can be of any help at all—but how can I? I don’t see how I CAN help you.’
“但是能做什么呢？”她谦虚地低声说道。 “如果我能帮上什么忙，你就必须利用我——但我能怎么帮忙呢？”我不知道我能如何帮助你。

He looked down at her critically.
他低头批判地看着她。

‘I don’t want you to HELP,’ he said, slightly irritated, ‘because there’s nothing to be DONE. I only want sympathy, do you see: I want somebody I can talk to sympathetically. That eases the strain. And there IS nobody to talk to sympathetically. That’s the curious thing. There IS nobody. There’s Rupert Birkin. But then he ISN’T sympathetic, he wants to DICTATE. And that is no use whatsoever.’
“我不想让你帮忙，”他有点恼怒地说，“因为没有什么可做的。”我只想要同情，你明白吗：我想要一个可以同情地与之交谈的人。这减轻了压力。没有人可以同情地与之交谈。这就是奇怪的事情。没有人。那是鲁珀特·伯金。但他并没有同情心，他想发号施令。但这是没有任何用处的。

She was caught in a strange snare. She looked down at her hands.
她陷入了一个奇怪的陷阱。她低头看着自己的双手。

Then there was the sound of the door softly opening. Gerald started. He was chagrined. It was his starting that really startled Gudrun. Then he went forward, with quick, graceful, intentional courtesy.
紧接着就是门轻轻打开的声音。杰拉德开始说道。他很懊恼。真正让古德伦吃惊的是他的起步。然后他向前走去，动作迅速、优雅、有礼貌。

‘Oh, mother!’ he said. ‘How nice of you to come down. How are you?’
“哦，妈妈！”他说。 ‘你能下来真是太好了。你好吗？'

The elderly woman, loosely and bulkily wrapped in a purple gown, came forward silently, slightly hulked, as usual. Her son was at her side. He pushed her up a chair, saying ‘You know Miss Brangwen, don’t you?’
老妇人裹着宽松的紫色长袍，默默地走了过来，身材略显魁梧，一如往常。她的儿子就在她身边。他把她推到椅子上，说道：“你认识布兰文小姐，不是吗？”

The mother glanced at Gudrun indifferently.
母亲冷漠地看了古珍一眼。

‘Yes,’ she said. Then she turned her wonderful, forget-me-not blue eyes up to her son, as she slowly sat down in the chair he had brought her.
“是的，”她说。然后，她把那双令人惊叹的、勿忘我的蓝眼睛转向她的儿子，慢慢地坐在他给她带来的椅子上。

‘I came to ask you about your father,’ she said, in her rapid, scarcely-audible voice. ‘I didn’t know you had company.’
“我来是想问一下你父亲的情况，”她用她快得几乎听不见的声音说道。 “我不知道有你陪伴。”

‘No? Didn’t Winifred tell you? Miss Brangwen stayed to dinner, to make us a little more lively—‘
'不？温妮弗雷德没告诉过你吗？布兰文小姐留下来吃晚饭，让我们热闹一点——”

Mrs Crich turned slowly round to Gudrun, and looked at her, but with unseeing eyes.
克里奇夫人慢慢地转向古德伦，看着她，但眼神却是茫然。

‘I’m afraid it would be no treat to her.’ Then she turned again to her son. ‘Winifred tells me the doctor had something to say about your father. What is it?’
“恐怕这对她来说没什么好处。”然后她又转向儿子。 “温妮弗雷德告诉我，医生对你父亲说了一些话。它是什么？'

‘Only that the pulse is very weak—misses altogether a good many times—so that he might not last the night out,’ Gerald replied.
“只是脉搏非常微弱——很多次都没有脉搏——所以他可能无法熬过这个晚上，”杰拉德回答道。

Mrs Crich sat perfectly impassive, as if she had not heard. Her bulk seemed hunched in the chair, her fair hair hung slack over her ears. But her skin was clear and fine, her hands, as she sat with them forgotten and folded, were quite beautiful, full of potential energy. A great mass of energy seemed decaying up in that silent, hulking form.
克里奇夫人面无表情地坐着，仿佛没有听见。她的身材似乎驼背在椅子上，金色的头发松弛地垂在耳朵上。但她的皮肤白净细腻，她那双忘却交叠的双手非常漂亮，充满了势能。巨大的能量似乎在那个无声无息、庞大的躯体中消逝。

She looked up at her son, as he stood, keen and soldierly, near to her. Her eyes were most wonderfully blue, bluer than forget-me-nots. She seemed to have a certain confidence in Gerald, and to feel a certain motherly mistrust of him.
她抬头看着儿子，他热切而勇敢地站在她身边。她的眼睛是非常奇妙的蓝，比勿忘我还要蓝。她似乎对杰拉尔德有一定的信心，但又对他怀有某种母亲般的不信任。

‘How are YOU?’ she muttered, in her strangely quiet voice, as if nobody should hear but him. ‘You’re not getting into a state, are you?
“你好吗？”她低声问道，声音出奇地安静，仿佛除了他之外没有人能听到。 ‘你不会进入一种状态，是吗？

You’re not letting it make you hysterical?’
你不会让它让你歇斯底里吗？

The curious challenge in the last words startled Gudrun.
最后一句话中的奇怪挑战让古德伦吃了一惊。

‘I don’t think so, mother,’ he answered, rather coldly cheery.
“我不这么认为，妈妈，”他冷冷地回答道。

‘Somebody’s got to see it through, you know.’
“你知道，必须有人坚持到底。”

‘Have they? Have they?’ answered his mother rapidly. ‘Why should YOU take it on yourself? What have you got to do, seeing it through. It will see itself through. You are not needed.’
‘有吗？是吗？”他母亲迅速回答道。 ‘为什么你要自己承担这个责任？你要做什么，看透它。它会看清自己。不需要你。

‘No, I don’t suppose I can do any good,’ he answered. ‘It’s just how it affects us, you see.’
“不，我不认为我能做任何好事，”他回答道。 “你看，这就是它对我们的影响。”

‘You like to be affected—don’t you? It’s quite nuts for you? You would have to be important. You have no need to stop at home. Why don’t you go away!’
“你喜欢被影响——不是吗？这对你来说很疯狂吗？你一定很重要。您无需留在家里。你为什么不走开！

These sentences, evidently the ripened grain of many dark hours, took Gerald by surprise.
这些句子显然是许多黑暗时刻的成熟果实，让杰拉德大吃一惊。

‘I don’t think it’s any good going away now, mother, at the last minute,’ he said, coldly.
“我觉得现在离开没有什么好处，妈妈，在最后一刻，”他冷冷地说。

‘You take care,’ replied his mother. ‘You mind YOURSELF—that’s your business. You take too much on yourself. You mind YOURSELF, or you’ll find yourself in Queer Street, that’s what will happen to you. You’re hysterical, always were.’
“你保重，”他的母亲回答道。 ‘你管好自己——那是你的事。你对自己承担太多了。你要介意自己，否则你会发现自己身处酷儿街，这就是你会发生的事情。你很歇斯底里，一直都是。

‘I’m all right, mother,’ he said. ‘There’s no need to worry about ME, I assure you.’
“我很好，妈妈，”他说。 “我向你保证，不用担心我。”

‘Let the dead bury their dead—don’t go and bury yourself along with them—that’s what I tell you. I know you well enough.’
‘让死人埋葬他们的死人吧——不要去把你自己和他们一起埋葬——这就是我告诉你的。我很了解你。

He did not answer this, not knowing what to say. The mother sat bunched up in silence, her beautiful white hands, that had no rings whatsoever, clasping the pommels of her arm-chair.
他没有回答这个问题，也不知道该说什么。母亲静静地坐着，她美丽白皙、没有任何戒指的手紧握着扶手椅的鞍头。

‘You can’t do it,’ she said, almost bitterly. ‘You haven’t the nerve. You’re as weak as a cat, really—always were. Is this young woman staying here?’
“你做不到，”她几乎是痛苦地说道。 ‘你没有勇气。你就像一只猫一样虚弱，真的——一直都是。这位年轻女子住在这里吗？

‘No,’ said Gerald. ‘She is going home tonight.’
“不，”杰拉尔德说。 “她今晚要回家。”

‘Then she’d better have the dog-cart. Does she go far?’
“那么她最好拥有狗车。”她会走很远吗？

‘Only to Beldover.’
“只给贝尔多弗。”

‘Ah!’ The elderly woman never looked at Gudrun, yet she seemed to take knowledge of her presence.
“啊！”老妇人没有看古德伦，但她似乎知道她的存在。

‘You are inclined to take too much on yourself, Gerald,’ said the mother, pulling herself to her feet, with a little difficulty.
“杰拉德，你总是想承担太多的责任。”母亲说着，费了点力气才站了起来。

‘Will you go, mother?’ he asked, politely.
“你要去吗，妈妈？”他礼貌地问道。

‘Yes, I’ll go up again,’ she replied. Turning to Gudrun, she bade her ‘Good-night.’ Then she went slowly to the door, as if she were unaccustomed to walking. At the door she lifted her face to him, implicitly. He kissed her.
“是的，我会再上去，”她回答道。她转向古珍，向她道了声“晚安”。然后她慢慢地向门口走去，仿佛她不习惯走路。到了门口，她含蓄地向他抬起头。他吻了她。

‘Don’t come any further with me,’ she said, in her barely audible voice. ‘I don’t want you any further.’
“别跟我走得更远了，”她用几乎听不见的声音说道。 “我不再想要你了。”

He bade her good-night, watched her across to the stairs and mount slowly. Then he closed the door and came back to Gudrun. Gudrun rose also, to go.
他向她道了晚安，看着她走到楼梯口，慢慢上楼。然后他关上门，回到古德伦身边。古珍也起身要走。

‘A queer being, my mother,’ he said.
“我的母亲，一个奇怪的人，”他说。

‘Yes,’ replied Gudrun.
“是的，”古德伦回答道。

‘She has her own thoughts.’
“她有自己的想法。”

‘Yes,’ said Gudrun.
“是的，”古德伦说。

Then they were silent.
然后他们就沉默了。

‘You want to go?’ he asked. ‘Half a minute, I’ll just have a horse put in—‘
“你想去吗？”他问。 “半分钟，我就把一匹马放进去——”

‘No,’ said Gudrun. ‘I want to walk.’
“不，”古德伦说。 “我想走路。”

He had promised to walk with her down the long, lonely mile of drive, and she wanted this.
他答应陪她走过漫长而孤独的一英里车程，而她想要这个。

‘You might JUST as well drive,’ he said.
“你还是开车吧，”他说。

‘I’d MUCH RATHER walk,’ she asserted, with emphasis.
“我宁愿走路，”她强调地说。

‘You would! Then I will come along with you. You know where your things are? I’ll put boots on.’
'你会！那我就跟你一起去吧。你知道你的东西在哪里吗？我会穿上靴子。

He put on a cap, and an overcoat over his evening dress. They went out into the night.
他戴上帽子，在晚礼服外面套上一件大衣。他们出去走进夜色。

‘Let us light a cigarette,’ he said, stopping in a sheltered angle of the porch. ‘You have one too.’
“让我们点一支烟吧，”他在门廊的一个隐蔽的角落里停下来说道。 “你也有一个。”

So, with the scent of tobacco on the night air, they set off down the dark drive that ran between close-cut hedges through sloping meadows.
于是，带着夜晚空气中的烟草香味，他们沿着黑暗的车道出发，这条车道穿过狭窄的树篱，穿过倾斜的草地。

He wanted to put his arm round her. If he could put his arm round her, and draw her against him as they walked, he would equilibriate himself. For now he felt like a pair of scales, the half of which tips down and down into an indefinite void. He must recover some sort of balance. And here was the hope and the perfect recovery.
他想用手臂搂住她。如果他能用手臂搂住她，并在他们走路时将她拉向他，他就能平衡自己。现在他感觉自己就像一对天平，一半向下倾斜，陷入无限的虚空。他必须恢复某种平衡。这就是希望和完美的康复。

Blind to her, thinking only of himself, he slipped his arm softly round her waist, and drew her to him. Her heart fainted, feeling herself taken. But then, his arm was so strong, she quailed under its powerful close grasp. She died a little death, and was drawn against him as they walked down the stormy darkness. He seemed to balance her perfectly in opposition to himself, in their dual motion of walking. So, suddenly, he was liberated and perfect, strong, heroic.
他对她视而不见，只想着自己，轻轻地用手臂搂住她的腰，把她拉到自己身边。她的心一颤，感觉自己被夺走了。然而，他的手臂如此有力，她在他有力的紧握下瑟瑟发抖。当他们走在暴风雨般的黑暗中时，她死了一点，并被他吸引了。在他们行走的双重动作中，他似乎完美地平衡了她和他自己。于是，突然之间，他获得了解放，变得完美、坚强、英勇。

He put his hand to his mouth and threw his cigarette away, a gleaming point, into the unseen hedge. Then he was quite free to balance her.
他把手放在嘴边，把香烟扔到看不见的树篱里，烟头闪闪发光。然后他就可以很自由地平衡她了。

‘That’s better,’ he said, with exultancy.
“这样好多了，”他兴奋地说。

The exultation in his voice was like a sweetish, poisonous drug to her. Did she then mean so much to him! She sipped the poison.
他声音中的狂喜对她来说就像是一种甜甜的、有毒的药物。难道她对他来说就这么重要吗！她喝下了毒药。

‘Are you happier?’ she asked, wistfully.
“你幸福吗？”她若有所思地问道。

‘Much better,’ he said, in the same exultant voice, ‘and I was rather far gone.’
“好多了，”他用同样兴奋的声音说道，“而且我已经走了很远了。”

She nestled against him. He felt her all soft and warm, she was the rich, lovely substance of his being. The warmth and motion of her walk suffused through him wonderfully.
她依偎在他身边。他感觉到她柔软而温暖，她是他生命中丰富而可爱的物质。她走路时的温暖和动感美妙地弥漫在他的全身。

‘I’m SO glad if I help you,’ she said.
“如果我能帮助你，我很高兴，”她说。

‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘There’s nobody else could do it, if you wouldn’t.’
“是的，”他回答道。 “如果你做不到的话，没有人能做到。”

‘That is true,’ she said to herself, with a thrill of strange, fatal elation.
“确实如此，”她对自己说，带着一种奇怪的、致命的兴奋的兴奋。

As they walked, he seemed to lift her nearer and nearer to himself, till she moved upon the firm vehicle of his body.
当他们行走时，他似乎把她举得离自己越来越近，直到她在他坚实的身体上移动。

He was so strong, so sustaining, and he could not be opposed. She drifted along in a wonderful interfusion of physical motion, down the dark, blowy hillside. Far across shone the little yellow lights of Beldover, many of them, spread in a thick patch on another dark hill. But he and she were walking in perfect, isolated darkness, outside the world.
他是那么的坚强，那么的坚持，没有人可以反对。她以一种美妙的身体动作混合着的姿态，沿着黑暗、微风吹过的山坡而下。远处，贝尔多弗的黄色小灯闪烁着，其中很多，在另一座黑暗的山上铺成厚厚的一片。但他和她却走在世界之外完美、孤立的黑暗中。

‘But how much do you care for me!’ came her voice, almost querulous. ‘You see, I don’t know, I don’t understand!’
“但是你有多关心我啊！”她的声音几乎带着抱怨。 “你看，我不知道，我不明白！”

‘How much!’ His voice rang with a painful elation. ‘I don’t know either—but everything.’ He was startled by his own declaration. It was true. So he stripped himself of every safeguard, in making this admission to her. He cared everything for her—she was everything.
“多少钱！”他的声音带着痛苦的兴奋。 “我也不知道——但一切都知道。”他被自己的声明吓了一跳。这是真的。所以他在向她承认这一点时，放弃了一切保障。他关心她的一切——她就是一切。

‘But I can’t believe it,’ said her low voice, amazed, trembling. She was trembling with doubt and exultance. This was the thing she wanted to hear, only this. Yet now she heard it, heard the strange clapping vibration of truth in his voice as he said it, she could not believe. She could not believe—she did not believe. Yet she believed, triumphantly, with fatal exultance.
“但我不敢相信，”她低声说道，惊讶而颤抖。她因怀疑和狂喜而浑身发抖。她想听的就是这个，也只有这个。然而现在她听到了，听到他说这句话时声音中带着真理的奇怪拍手振动，她简直不敢相信。她无法相信——她不相信。但她坚信，得意洋洋，欣喜若狂。

‘Why not?’ he said. ‘Why don’t you believe it? It’s true. It is true, as we stand at this moment—‘ he stood still with her in the wind; ‘I care for nothing on earth, or in heaven, outside this spot where we are. And it isn’t my own presence I care about, it is all yours. I’d sell my soul a hundred times—but I couldn’t bear not to have you here. I couldn’t bear to be alone. My brain would burst. It is true.’ He drew her closer to him, with definite movement.
“为什么不呢？”他说。 ‘你为什么不相信呢？这是真的。确实如此，就我们此刻而言——”他和她一起站在风中； ‘除了我们所在的这个地方，我不关心地球上或天堂上的任何事情。我关心的不是我自己的存在，而是你的存在。我愿意出卖我的灵魂一百次——但我无法忍受你不在身边。我无法忍受孤独。我的大脑要爆炸了。是的。”他用明确的动作把她拉近了一些。

‘No,’ she murmured, afraid. Yet this was what she wanted. Why did she so lose courage?
“不，”她害怕地低声说道。然而这正是她想要的。她为何如此失去勇气？

They resumed their strange walk. They were such strangers—and yet they were so frightfully, unthinkably near. It was like a madness. Yet it was what she wanted, it was what she wanted. They had descended the hill, and now they were coming to the square arch where the road passed under the colliery railway. The arch, Gudrun knew, had walls of squared stone, mossy on one side with water that trickled down, dry on the other side. She had stood under it to hear the train rumble thundering over the logs overhead. And she knew that under this dark and lonely bridge the young colliers stood in the darkness with their sweethearts, in rainy weather. And so she wanted to stand under the bridge with HER sweetheart, and be kissed under the bridge in the invisible darkness. Her steps dragged as she drew near.
他们又继续奇怪的步伐。他们是那么陌生——然而却又那么近得可怕、难以想象。这就像疯狂一样。但这就是她想要的，这就是她想要的。他们已经下山了，现在正来到煤矿铁路下方道路经过的方形拱门处。古德伦知道，拱门有方形石墙，一侧长满青苔，有水滴下来，另一侧则干燥。她站在树下，听到火车在头顶的原木上隆隆作响。她知道，在这座黑暗而孤独的桥下，年轻的矿工们和他们的心上人，在雨天里站在黑暗中。所以她想和心上人一起站在桥下，在桥下看不见的黑暗中被亲吻。当她走近时，她的脚步变得缓慢。

So, under the bridge, they came to a standstill, and he lifted her upon his breast. His body vibrated taut and powerful as he closed upon her and crushed her, breathless and dazed and destroyed, crushed her upon his breast. Ah, it was terrible, and perfect. Under this bridge, the colliers pressed their lovers to their breast. And now, under the bridge, the master of them all pressed her to himself? And how much more powerful and terrible was his embrace than theirs, how much more concentrated and supreme his love was, than theirs in the same sort! She felt she would swoon, die, under the vibrating, inhuman tension of his arms and his body—she would pass away. Then the unthinkable high vibration slackened and became more undulating. He slackened and drew her with him to stand with his back to the wall.
于是，他们在桥下停了下来，他把她抱在胸前。当他靠近她、压碎她时，他的身体绷紧而有力地颤抖着，她喘不过气来，茫然无措，被摧毁了，把她压在他的胸前。啊，这太糟糕了，但也很完美。在这座桥下，矿工们将他们的爱人紧紧地抱在怀里。而现在，桥下，他们的主人都将她压在自己身边？他的拥抱比他们的拥抱多么有力和可怕，他的爱比他们的同类更加集中和至高无上！她觉得自己会在他手臂和身体那振动的、非人的张力下昏厥、死去——她会死去。然后那难以想象的高振动减弱了，变得更加波动。他放松下来，拉着她背靠墙站着。

She was almost unconscious. So the colliers’ lovers would stand with their backs to the walls, holding their sweethearts and kissing them as she was being kissed. Ah, but would their kisses be fine and powerful as the kisses of the firm-mouthed master? Even the keen, short-cut moustache—the colliers would not have that.
她几乎失去知觉。因此，煤矿工人的恋人会背靠墙站着，抱着他们的心上人，亲吻他们，就像她被亲吻一样。啊，但是他们的吻会像那位嘴硬的主人的吻那样细腻而有力吗？即使是尖刻的短胡子——煤矿工人也没有。

And the colliers’ sweethearts would, like herself, hang their heads back limp over their shoulder, and look out from the dark archway, at the close patch of yellow lights on the unseen hill in the distance, or at the vague form of trees, and at the buildings of the colliery wood-yard, in the other direction.
煤矿工人的情人也会像她自己一样，把头无力地垂在肩上，从黑暗的拱门向外望去，望着远处看不见的山上那一小片黄色的灯光，或者望着树木的模糊形状，以及另一个方向的煤矿堆木场的建筑物。

His arms were fast around her, he seemed to be gathering her into himself, her warmth, her softness, her adorable weight, drinking in the suffusion of her physical being, avidly. He lifted her, and seemed to pour her into himself, like wine into a cup.
他的双臂紧紧地搂着她，似乎要把她抱进自己的怀里，她的温暖，她的柔软，她可爱的重量，贪婪地吸收着她肉体的存在。他举起她，似乎将她倒入自己体内，就像将酒倒入杯中一样。

‘This is worth everything,’ he said, in a strange, penetrating voice.
“这一切都是值得的，”他用一种奇怪而尖锐的声音说道。

So she relaxed, and seemed to melt, to flow into him, as if she were some infinitely warm and precious suffusion filling into his veins, like an intoxicant. Her arms were round his neck, he kissed her and held her perfectly suspended, she was all slack and flowing into him, and he was the firm, strong cup that receives the wine of her life. So she lay cast upon him, stranded, lifted up against him, melting and melting under his kisses, melting into his limbs and bones, as if he were soft iron becoming surcharged with her electric life.
于是她放松了，似乎融化了，流入他的体内，仿佛她是一种无限温暖、珍贵的液体，充盈在他的血管里，就像一种麻醉剂。她的双臂搂着他的脖子，他吻着她，将她完美地悬浮在空中，她浑身松弛，流入他的体内，而他就是那坚固、有力的杯子，接收着她生命中的美酒。于是她躺在他身上，被困住了，被举起靠在他身上，在他的吻下不断融化，融化到他的四肢和骨头里，仿佛他是软铁，充满了她的生命。

Till she seemed to swoon, gradually her mind went, and she passed away, everything in her was melted down and fluid, and she lay still, become contained by him, sleeping in him as lightning sleeps in a pure, soft stone. So she was passed away and gone in him, and he was perfected.
直到她似乎昏倒了，渐渐地，她的思绪消失了，她去世了，她体内的一切都融化了，流动了，她一动不动地躺着，被他包容着，睡在他身上，就像闪电睡在一块纯净、柔软的石头里一样。于是她就去世了，进入了他的身体，他就变得完美了。

When she opened her eyes again, and saw the patch of lights in the distance, it seemed to her strange that the world still existed, that she was standing under the bridge resting her head on Gerald’s breast. Gerald—who was he? He was the exquisite adventure, the desirable unknown to her.
当她再次睁开眼睛，看到远处的那片灯光时，她觉得很奇怪，世界仍然存在，她站在桥下，头靠在杰拉尔德的胸前。杰拉德——他是谁？他是一次绝妙的冒险，对她来说是令人向往的未知。

She looked up, and in the darkness saw his face above her, his shapely, male face. There seemed a faint, white light emitted from him, a white aura, as if he were visitor from the unseen. She reached up, like Eve reaching to the apples on the tree of knowledge, and she kissed him, though her passion was a transcendent fear of the thing he was, touching his face with her infinitely delicate, encroaching wondering fingers. Her fingers went over the mould of his face, over his features. How perfect and foreign he was—ah how dangerous! Her soul thrilled with complete knowledge. This was the glistening, forbidden apple, this face of a man. She kissed him, putting her fingers over his face, his eyes, his nostrils, over his brows and his ears, to his neck, to know him, to gather him in by touch. He was so firm, and shapely, with such satisfying, inconceivable shapeliness, strange, yet unutterably clear. He was such an unutterable enemy, yet glistening with uncanny white fire. She wanted to touch him and touch him and touch him, till she had him all in her hands, till she had strained him into her knowledge. Ah, if she could have the precious KNOWLEDGE of him, she would be filled, and nothing could deprive her of this. For he was so unsure, so risky in the common world of day.
她抬起头，在黑暗中看到他的脸在她上方，他那张匀称的男性脸。他身上似乎散发着淡淡的白光，一种白色的气息，仿佛是来自无形的访客。她抬起手，就像夏娃伸手去摘知识树上的苹果一样，她吻了他，尽管她的热情是对他这个人的超然恐惧，用她无限精致、令人好奇的手指抚摸着他的脸。她的手指抚过他的脸型，抚过他的五官。他是多么完美，多么陌生——啊，多么危险！她的灵魂因完整的知识而激动不已。这是闪闪发光的禁苹果，这张男人的脸。她吻他，用手指抚过他的脸、他的眼睛、他的鼻孔、他的眉毛、他的耳朵、他的脖子，了解他，通过触摸将他聚集在一起。他是那样坚定，那样匀称，那样的匀称，令人难以置信，奇怪，却又无比清晰。他是一个难以形容的敌人，却闪烁着不可思议的白色火焰。她想要触碰他，触碰他，触碰他，直到她将他全部掌握在她手中，直到她将他强加于她的知识之中。啊，如果她能拥有关于他的宝贵知识，她就会心满意足，没有什么可以剥夺她的这一点。因为在当今的平凡世界中，他是如此的不确定，如此的冒险。

‘You are so BEAUTIFUL,’ she murmured in her throat.
“你真美丽。”她在喉咙里低声说道。

He wondered, and was suspended. But she felt him quiver, and she came down involuntarily nearer upon him. He could not help himself. Her fingers had him under their power. The fathomless, fathomless desire they could evoke in him was deeper than death, where he had no choice.
他想知道，然后就被暂停了。但她感觉到他在颤抖，她不由自主地靠近了他。他情不自禁。她的手指控制住了他。它们在他身上激起的深不可测、深不可测的欲望比死亡还要深，他别无选择。

But she knew now, and it was enough. For the time, her soul was destroyed with the exquisite shock of his invisible fluid lightning. She knew. And this knowledge was a death from which she must recover. How much more of him was there to know? Ah much, much, many days harvesting for her large, yet perfectly subtle and intelligent hands upon the field of his living, radio-active body. Ah, her hands were eager, greedy for knowledge. But for the present it was enough, enough, as much as her soul could bear. Too much, and she would shatter herself, she would fill the fine vial of her soul too quickly, and it would break. Enough now—enough for the time being. There were all the after days when her hands, like birds, could feed upon the fields of him mystical plastic form—till then enough.
但她现在知道了，这就足够了。一时之间，她的灵魂就被他无形的流雷的绝妙冲击给摧毁了。她知道了。她必须从这种认识中恢复过来。他还有多少事情需要了解呢？啊，很多很多很多天，她那双大而完美、微妙而聪明的双手在他充满活力、放射性的身体上进行收割。啊，她的双手渴望知识。但目前已经足够了，足够了，只要她的灵魂能够承受。太多，她就会粉碎自己；她太快地装满她灵魂的精致小瓶，它就会破裂。现在够了——暂时够了。在接下来的日子里，她的手就像鸟儿一样，可以在他神秘的塑料形态的领域中进食——直到那时为止。

And even he was glad to be checked, rebuked, held back. For to desire is better than to possess, the finality of the end was dreaded as deeply as it was desired.
就连他也很高兴被检查、被责备、被阻止。因为渴望胜于拥有，所以人们对结局的恐惧与渴望的程度一样深。

They walked on towards the town, towards where the lamps threaded singly, at long intervals down the dark high-road of the valley. They came at length to the gate of the drive.
他们继续向城镇走去，沿着山谷黑暗的大路，向灯火间隔很长的地方走去。他们终于来到了车道门口。

‘Don’t come any further,’ she said.
“别再往前走了，”她说。

‘You’d rather I didn’t?’ he asked, relieved. He did not want to go up the public streets with her, his soul all naked and alight as it was.
“你宁愿我不这么做？”他松了口气问道。他不想和她一起走在公共街道上，他的灵魂就这样赤裸裸地燃烧着。

‘Much rather—good-night.’ She held out her hand. He grasped it, then touched the perilous, potent fingers with his lips.
“更确切地说——晚安。”她伸出手。他抓住了它，然后用嘴唇触碰了那危险而有力的手指。

‘Good-night,’ he said. ‘Tomorrow.’
“晚安，”他说。 '明天。'

And they parted. He went home full of the strength and the power of living desire.
他们分手了。他带着对生活的渴望的力量和力量回家了。

But the next day, she did not come, she sent a note that she was kept indoors by a cold. Here was a torment! But he possessed his soul in some sort of patience, writing a brief answer, telling her how sorry he was not to see her.
但第二天，她没有来，她发了一张纸条，说她因感冒而待在室内。这是一种折磨！但他以某种耐心控制住了自己的灵魂，写了一份简短的答复，告诉她他没有见到她是多么遗憾。

The day after this, he stayed at home—it seemed so futile to go down to the office. His father could not live the week out. And he wanted to be at home, suspended.
第二天，他呆在家里——去办公室似乎是徒劳的。他的父亲无法活过这一周。他想待在家里，暂停。

Gerald sat on a chair by the window in his father’s room. The landscape outside was black and winter-sodden. His father lay grey and ashen on the bed, a nurse moved silently in her white dress, neat and elegant, even beautiful. There was a scent of eau-de-cologne in the room. The nurse went out of the room, Gerald was alone with death, facing the winter-black landscape.
杰拉尔德坐在父亲房间窗边的椅子上。外面的景色一片漆黑，充满了冬天的气息。父亲灰白的躺在床上，护士穿着白色的裙子默默地走动，干净优雅，甚至美丽。房间里弥漫着古龙水的香味。护士走出了房间，杰拉德独自面对着死亡，面对着冬日黑色的风景。

‘Is there much more water in Denley?’ came the faint voice, determined and querulous, from the bed. The dying man was asking about a leakage from Willey Water into one of the pits.
“丹利还有更多的水吗？”床上传来微弱的声音，声音坚定而充满抱怨。那位垂死的男子正在询问威利水厂是否漏水到其中一个坑中。

‘Some more—we shall have to run off the lake,’ said Gerald.
“还有一些——我们得跑出湖了，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Will you?’ The faint voice filtered to extinction. There was dead stillness. The grey-faced, sick man lay with eyes closed, more dead than death. Gerald looked away. He felt his heart was seared, it would perish if this went on much longer.
“你愿意吗？”微弱的声音渐渐消失。一片死寂。那个面色苍白的病人闭着眼睛躺在那里，比死还要死。杰拉德移开了视线。他感觉自己的心被灼烧了，再这样下去，他的心就会消亡。

Suddenly he heard a strange noise. Turning round, he saw his father’s eyes wide open, strained and rolling in a frenzy of inhuman struggling. Gerald started to his feet, and stood transfixed in horror.
突然，他听到了奇怪的声音。转过身来，他看到父亲的眼睛睁得大大的，紧张地翻滚着，进行着非人的疯狂挣扎。杰拉尔德站了起来，惊恐地站在那里。

‘Wha-a-ah-h-h-’ came a horrible choking rattle from his father’s throat, the fearful, frenzied eye, rolling awfully in its wild fruitless search for help, passed blindly over Gerald, then up came the dark blood and mess pumping over the face of the agonised being. The tense body relaxed, the head fell aside, down the pillow.
“哇啊啊啊啊啊啊——”从他父亲的喉咙里发出可怕的、令人窒息的嘎嘎声，那只恐惧、疯狂的眼睛在疯狂地徒劳地寻求帮助时可怕地转动着，盲目地从杰拉德身上掠过，然后黑色的血液和混乱涌了上来。在痛苦的人的脸上。紧张的身体放松下来，头垂到一边，落到枕头上。

Gerald stood transfixed, his soul echoing in horror. He would move, but he could not. He could not move his limbs. His brain seemed to re-echo, like a pulse.
杰拉尔德呆呆地站着，他的灵魂在恐惧中回响。他会动，但他不能。他的四肢无法移动。他的大脑似乎重新回响，就像脉搏一样。

The nurse in white softly entered. She glanced at Gerald, then at the bed.
白衣护士轻声走进来。她看了一眼杰拉德，又看了一眼床。

‘Ah!’ came her soft whimpering cry, and she hurried forward to the dead man. ‘Ah-h!’ came the slight sound of her agitated distress, as she stood bending over the bedside. Then she recovered, turned, and came for towel and sponge. She was wiping the dead face carefully, and murmuring, almost whimpering, very softly: ‘Poor Mr Crich!—Poor Mr Crich! Poor Mr Crich!’
“啊！”她发出一声轻柔的呜咽声，然后她急忙走向死者。 “啊——啊！”当她弯腰站在床边时，传来她焦躁不安的轻微声音。然后她回过神来，转身去拿毛巾和海绵。她小心翼翼地擦拭着死去的脸，轻声低语，几乎是呜咽：“可怜的克里奇先生！——可怜的克里奇先生！”可怜的克里奇先生！

‘Is he dead?’ clanged Gerald’s sharp voice.
“他死了吗？”杰拉尔德尖锐的声音响起。

‘Oh yes, he’s gone,’ replied the soft, moaning voice of the nurse, as she looked up at Gerald’s face. She was young and beautiful and quivering. A strange sort of grin went over Gerald’s face, over the horror. And he walked out of the room.
“哦，是的，他走了。”护士抬头看着杰拉德的脸，用轻柔的呻吟声回答道。她年轻、美丽、浑身颤抖。杰拉德的脸上浮现出一种奇怪的笑容，掩饰着恐惧。然后他走出了房间。

He was going to tell his mother. On the landing he met his brother Basil.
他要告诉他的母亲。在楼梯平台上，他遇到了他的兄弟巴兹尔。

‘He’s gone, Basil,’ he said, scarcely able to subdue his voice, not to let an unconscious, frightening exultation sound through.
“他走了，巴兹尔，”他说，几乎无法抑制自己的声音，不让一种无意识的、可怕的狂喜传出。

‘What?’ cried Basil, going pale.
“什么？”巴兹尔喊道，脸色变得苍白。

Gerald nodded. Then he went on to his mother’s room.
杰拉德点点头。然后他就去了他母亲的房间。

She was sitting in her purple gown, sewing, very slowly sewing, putting in a stitch then another stitch. She looked up at Gerald with her blue undaunted eyes.
她穿着紫色的长袍，坐在那儿缝纫，非常慢地缝纫，缝一针，然后又缝一针。她抬起头，用那双无所畏惧的蓝色眼睛看着杰拉德。

‘Father’s gone,’ he said.
“父亲走了，”他说。

‘He’s dead? Who says so?’
'他死了？谁这么说的？

‘Oh, you know, mother, if you see him.’
“哦，你知道，妈妈，如果你看到他的话。”

She put her sewing down, and slowly rose.
她放下手中的针线活，缓缓起身。

‘Are you going to see him?’ he asked.
“你要去见他吗？”他问道。

‘Yes,’ she said
“是的，”她说

By the bedside the children already stood in a weeping group.
孩子们已经站在床边哭泣。

‘Oh, mother!’ cried the daughters, almost in hysterics, weeping loudly.
“哦，妈妈！”女儿们几乎歇斯底里地大声喊道。

But the mother went forward. The dead man lay in repose, as if gently asleep, so gently, so peacefully, like a young man sleeping in purity. He was still warm. She stood looking at him in gloomy, heavy silence, for some time.
但母亲却向前走去。死者静静地躺着，仿佛轻轻地睡着了，那么温柔，那么安详，就像一个纯洁地睡着的年轻人。他还是很温暖。她站在那儿，阴郁而沉重地沉默着，看了他好一会儿。

‘Ay,’ she said bitterly, at length, speaking as if to the unseen witnesses of the air. ‘You’re dead.’ She stood for some minutes in silence, looking down. ‘Beautiful,’ she asserted, ‘beautiful as if life had never touched you—never touched you. God send I look different. I hope I shall look my years, when I am dead. Beautiful, beautiful,’ she crooned over him. ‘You can see him in his teens, with his first beard on his face. A beautiful soul, beautiful—‘ Then there was a tearing in her voice as she cried: ‘None of you look like this, when you are dead! Don’t let it happen again.’ It was a strange, wild command from out of the unknown. Her children moved unconsciously together, in a nearer group, at the dreadful command in her voice. The colour was flushed bright in her cheek, she looked awful and wonderful. ‘Blame me, blame me if you like, that he lies there like a lad in his teens, with his first beard on his face. Blame me if you like. But you none of you know.’ She was silent in intense silence.
“唉，”她最后痛苦地说，仿佛对空中看不见的目击者说。 “你死定了。”她低着头，沉默地站了几分钟。 “美丽，”她断言，“美丽得好像生活从来没有碰过你——从来没有碰过你。”上帝让我看起来不一样了。我希望当我死后，我能看看我的岁月。美丽，美丽，”她对着他低声说道。 “你可以看到他十几岁的时候，脸上长出了第一根胡须。一个美丽的灵魂，美丽——”然后她的声音里带着泪水，她哭喊着：“你们死后，没有一个看起来像现在这样！”不要让这种事再次发生。”这是来自未知世界的奇怪而疯狂的命令。她的孩子们听从她声音中可怕的命令，无意识地凑在一起，凑得更近了。她的脸颊涨得通红，看上去既可怕又美妙。 ‘怪我，怪我，如果你愿意的话，他躺在那里就像一个十几岁的小伙子，脸上长着第一根胡子。如果你喜欢就怪我吧。但你们谁都不知道。”她陷入了极度的沉默。

Then there came, in a low, tense voice: ‘If I thought that the children I bore would lie looking like that in death, I’d strangle them when they were infants, yes—‘
然后，声音低沉而紧张：“如果我想到我所生的孩子死后会像那样躺着，我会在他们还是婴儿的时候勒死他们，是的——”

‘No, mother,’ came the strange, clarion voice of Gerald from the background, ‘we are different, we don’t blame you.’
“不，妈妈，”背景中传来杰拉尔德奇怪而响亮的声音，“我们不同，我们不怪你。”

She turned and looked full in his eyes. Then she lifted her hands in a strange half-gesture of mad despair.
她转过身来，充满了他的目光。然后她举起了双手，做出了一种奇怪的、半疯狂的绝望姿势。

‘Pray!’ she said strongly. ‘Pray for yourselves to God, for there’s no help for you from your parents.’
“祈祷吧！”她坚定地说。 “请为自己向上帝祈祷，因为你的父母无法为你提供帮助。”

‘Oh mother!’ cried her daughters wildly.
“噢，妈妈！”女儿们疯狂地喊道。

But she had turned and gone, and they all went quickly away from each other.
但她已经转身走了，他们很快就分开了。

When Gudrun heard that Mr Crich was dead, she felt rebuked. She had stayed away lest Gerald should think her too easy of winning. And now, he was in the midst of trouble, whilst she was cold.
当古德伦听说克里奇先生死了时，她感到受到了责备。她没有离开，以免杰拉尔德认为她太容易获胜。而现在，他却陷入了困境，而她却冷了。

The following day she went up as usual to Winifred, who was glad to see her, glad to get away into the studio. The girl had wept, and then, too frightened, had turned aside to avoid any more tragic eventuality. She and Gudrun resumed work as usual, in the isolation of the studio, and this seemed an immeasurable happiness, a pure world of freedom, after the aimlessness and misery of the house. Gudrun stayed on till evening. She and Winifred had dinner brought up to the studio, where they ate in freedom, away from all the people in the house.
第二天，她像往常一样去找威妮弗莱德，威妮弗莱德很高兴见到她，也很高兴能走进工作室。女孩哭了，然后，太害怕了，转过身去，以避免发生更多悲剧。她和古德伦像往常一样在工作室的隔离中恢复工作，在家里的漫无目的和痛苦之后，这似乎是一种无法估量的幸福，一个纯粹的自由世界。古德伦一直待到晚上。她和威妮弗雷德把晚餐带到了工作室，在那里他们可以自由地吃，远离屋子里的所有人。

After dinner Gerald came up. The great high studio was full of shadow and a fragrance of coffee. Gudrun and Winifred had a little table near the fire at the far end, with a white lamp whose light did not travel far. They were a tiny world to themselves, the two girls surrounded by lovely shadows, the beams and rafters shadowy over-head, the benches and implements shadowy down the studio.
晚饭后杰拉尔德过来了。高大的工作室里充满了阴影和咖啡的香味。古德伦和威妮弗莱德在远处的火炉旁摆了一张小桌子，桌上有一盏白灯，灯光不会传得很远。他们自己就是一个小世界，两个女孩被可爱的阴影包围着，头顶上的横梁和椽子阴暗，工作室下方的长凳和工具阴暗。

‘You are cosy enough here,’ said Gerald, going up to them.
“你们在这里很舒服，”杰拉德朝他们走过去说道。

There was a low brick fireplace, full of fire, an old blue Turkish rug, the little oak table with the lamp and the white-and-blue cloth and the dessert, and Gudrun making coffee in an odd brass coffee-maker, and Winifred scalding a little milk in a tiny saucepan.
有一个低矮的砖砌壁炉，充满了火，一张旧的蓝色土耳其地毯，一张带灯的小橡木桌子，白蓝色的桌布和甜点，古德伦在一个奇怪的黄铜咖啡机里煮咖啡，威妮弗雷德在小锅里煮一点牛奶。

‘Have you had coffee?’ said Gudrun.
“你喝咖啡了吗？”古德伦说。

‘I have, but I’ll have some more with you,’ he replied.
“我有，但我会再给你一些，”他回答道。

‘Then you must have it in a glass—there are only two cups,’ said Winifred.
“那么你必须把它装在玻璃杯里——只有两个杯子，”威妮弗雷德说。

‘It is the same to me,’ he said, taking a chair and coming into the charmed circle of the girls. How happy they were, how cosy and glamorous it was with them, in a world of lofty shadows! The outside world, in which he had been transacting funeral business all the day was completely wiped out. In an instant he snuffed glamour and magic.
“对我来说也是一样。”他一边说，一边坐下来，走进了女孩们迷人的圈子。在高高的阴影世界里，他们是多么幸福，和他们在一起是多么舒适和迷人！他整天处理丧事事务的外界彻底消失了。刹那间，他扼杀了魅力和魔法。

They had all their things very dainty, two odd and lovely little cups, scarlet and solid gilt, and a little black jug with scarlet discs, and the curious coffee-machine, whose spirit-flame flowed steadily, almost invisibly. There was the effect of rather sinister richness, in which Gerald at once escaped himself.
他们所有的东西都非常精致，两个奇怪而可爱的小杯子，猩红色和实心镀金，还有一个带有猩红色圆盘的黑色小壶，还有奇怪的咖啡机，它的酒精火焰稳定地流动，几乎看不见。杰拉尔德立刻逃脱了一种相当险恶的富裕的影响。

They all sat down, and Gudrun carefully poured out the coffee.
他们都坐下来，古德伦小心翼翼地倒出咖啡。

‘Will you have milk?’ she asked calmly, yet nervously poising the little black jug with its big red dots. She was always so completely controlled, yet so bitterly nervous.
“你要牛奶吗？”她平静地问道，但又紧张地摆好带有大红点的黑色小壶。她总是那么完全受控，却又那么紧张。

‘No, I won’t,’ he replied.
“不，我不会，”他回答道。

So, with a curious humility, she placed him the little cup of coffee, and herself took the awkward tumbler. She seemed to want to serve him.
于是，带着一种奇怪的谦逊，她把那小杯咖啡递给他，而她自己则接过那个笨拙的玻璃杯。她似乎很想为他服务。

‘Why don’t you give me the glass—it is so clumsy for you,’ he said. He would much rather have had it, and seen her daintily served. But she was silent, pleased with the disparity, with her self-abasement.
“你为什么不把杯子给我——这对你来说太笨拙了，”他说。他更愿意拥有它，并看到她被精心招待。但她沉默了，对这种差距和她的自卑感到满意。

‘You are quite EN MENAGE,’ he said.
“你真是太可爱了，”他说。

‘Yes. We aren’t really at home to visitors,’ said Winifred.
'是的。我们对访客并不感到宾至如归，”威妮弗雷德说。

‘You’re not? Then I’m an intruder?’
'你不？那我就是入侵者了？

For once he felt his conventional dress was out of place, he was an outsider.
这一次他觉得自己的传统着装不合时宜，他是一个局外人。

Gudrun was very quiet. She did not feel drawn to talk to him. At this stage, silence was best—or mere light words. It was best to leave serious things aside. So they talked gaily and lightly, till they heard the man below lead out the horse, and call it to ‘back-back!’ into the dog-cart that was to take Gudrun home. So she put on her things, and shook hands with Gerald, without once meeting his eyes. And she was gone.
古德伦非常安静。她不想和他说话。在这个阶段，沉默是最好的——或者只是轻描淡写。最好把严肃的事情放在一边。于是他们愉快而轻松地交谈着，直到听到下面的人把马牵出来，叫它“回来！”进入准备带古德伦回家的狗车。于是她穿上衣服，与杰拉德握手，但没有看他一眼。而她却不见了。

The funeral was detestable. Afterwards, at the tea-table, the daughters kept saying—‘He was a good father to us—the best father in the world’—or else—‘We shan’t easily find another man as good as father was.’
葬礼是令人厌恶的。后来，在茶桌上，女儿们不断地说：“他对我们来说是一位好父亲——世界上最好的父亲”——或者说——“我们很难找到另一个像父亲一样好的男人了。”

Gerald acquiesced in all this. It was the right conventional attitude, and, as far as the world went, he believed in the conventions. He took it as a matter of course. But Winifred hated everything, and hid in the studio, and cried her heart out, and wished Gudrun would come.
杰拉德默许了这一切。这是正确的传统态度，就世界而言，他相信这些传统。他认为这是理所当然的。但温妮弗雷德厌恶这一切，躲在画室里痛哭流涕，希望古德伦能来。

Luckily everybody was going away. The Criches never stayed long at home. By dinner-time, Gerald was left quite alone. Even Winifred was carried off to London, for a few days with her sister Laura.
幸好大家都走了。克里奇一家从来没有在家里呆太久。到了晚餐时间，杰拉德只剩下一个人了。就连威妮弗雷德也被带到伦敦，和她的妹妹劳拉一起住了几天。

But when Gerald was really left alone, he could not bear it. One day passed by, and another. And all the time he was like a man hung in chains over the edge of an abyss. Struggle as he might, he could not turn himself to the solid earth, he could not get footing. He was suspended on the edge of a void, writhing. Whatever he thought of, was the abyss—whether it were friends or strangers, or work or play, it all showed him only the same bottomless void, in which his heart swung perishing. There was no escape, there was nothing to grasp hold of. He must writhe on the edge of the chasm, suspended in chains of invisible physical life.
但当杰拉德真的只剩下一个人时，他就无法忍受了。一天过去了，又一天过去了。自始至终，他就像一个被锁链挂在深渊边缘的人。无论他如何挣扎，他都无法将自己转向坚实的大地，他无法站稳脚跟。他悬浮在虚空边缘，不断翻滚。无论他想到什么，都是深渊——无论是朋友还是陌生人，无论是工作还是娱乐，都给他带来同样的无底洞，他的心在其中摇摆着灭亡。没有逃脱的余地，也没有什么可以抓住的。他必须在鸿沟的边缘翻腾，被无形的肉体生命的锁链吊起来。

At first he was quiet, he kept still, expecting the extremity to pass away, expecting to find himself released into the world of the living, after this extremity of penance. But it did not pass, and a crisis gained upon him.
起初他很安静，一动不动，期待着这绝境的过去，期待着在经历了这绝境的苦行之后，他会发现自己被释放到生者的世界里。但事情并没有过去，危机降临到了他身上。

As the evening of the third day came on, his heart rang with fear. He could not bear another night. Another night was coming on, for another night he was to be suspended in chain of physical life, over the bottomless pit of nothingness. And he could not bear it. He could not bear it. He was frightened deeply, and coldly, frightened in his soul. He did not believe in his own strength any more. He could not fall into this infinite void, and rise again. If he fell, he would be gone for ever. He must withdraw, he must seek reinforcements. He did not believe in his own single self, any further than this.
第三天的傍晚来临，他的心里充满了恐惧。他无法再忍受一个晚上。又一个夜晚即将到来，又一个夜晚，他将被悬挂在肉体生命的锁链中，悬在虚无的无底深渊之上。他无法忍受。他无法忍受。他感到深深的恐惧，灵魂深处的恐惧。他不再相信自己的实力了。他无法坠入这无尽的虚空之中，再重新升起。如果他倒下了，他就会永远消失。他必须撤退，他必须寻求援军。他不相信自己，更不相信自己。

After dinner, faced with the ultimate experience of his own nothingness, he turned aside. He pulled on his boots, put on his coat, and set out to walk in the night.
晚饭后，面对着自己虚无的终极体验，他转过身去。他穿上靴子，穿上外套，开始在夜色中行走。

It was dark and misty. He went through the wood, stumbling and feeling his way to the Mill. Birkin was away. Good—he was half glad. He turned up the hill, and stumbled blindly over the wild slopes, having lost the path in the complete darkness. It was boring. Where was he going? No matter. He stumbled on till he came to a path again. Then he went on through another wood. His mind became dark, he went on automatically. Without thought or sensation, he stumbled unevenly on, out into the open again, fumbling for stiles, losing the path, and going along the hedges of the fields till he came to the outlet.
天黑了，雾蒙蒙的。他穿过树林，跌跌撞撞地摸索着来到了磨坊。伯金不在。很好——他有些高兴。他转身上了山，在一片荒凉的山坡上盲目地跌跌撞撞，在一片漆黑中迷失了方向。那很无聊。他要去哪里？不管。他跌跌撞撞地走着，直到又来到一条小路上。然后他继续穿过另一片树林。他的脑子一片漆黑，他不由自主地继续说下去。他没有思考，也没有感觉，跌跌撞撞地继续前行，再次来到空旷的地方，摸索着寻找栅栏，迷失了方向，沿着田野的树篱一直走到出口。

And at last he came to the high road. It had distracted him to struggle blindly through the maze of darkness. But now, he must take a direction. And he did not even know where he was. But he must take a direction now. Nothing would be resolved by merely walking, walking away. He had to take a direction.
最后他来到了大道上。它分散了他的注意力，让他在黑暗的迷宫中盲目地挣扎。但现在，他必须找一个方向。而他甚至不知道自己在哪里。但他现在必须确定一个方向。仅仅走走走走是解决不了任何问题的。他必须指明方向。

He stood still on the road, that was high in the utterly dark night, and he did not know where he was. It was a strange sensation, his heart beating, and ringed round with the utterly unknown darkness. So he stood for some time.
他一动不动地站在漆黑的夜色中高高的路上，他不知道自己身在何处。这是一种奇怪的感觉，他的心脏在跳动，周围环绕着完全未知的黑暗。于是他站了一会儿。

Then he heard footsteps, and saw a small, swinging light. He immediately went towards this. It was a miner.
然后他听到了脚步声，并看到了一个摇曳的小光。他立刻就朝这个方向走去。那是一名矿工。

‘Can you tell me,’ he said, ‘where this road goes?’
“你能告诉我，”他说，“这条路通向哪里？”

‘Road? Ay, it goes ter Whatmore.’
'路？是的，这就是什么。

‘Whatmore! Oh thank you, that’s right. I thought I was wrong. Good-night.’
'还有什么！噢，谢谢，原来如此。我以为我错了。晚安。'

‘Good-night,’ replied the broad voice of the miner.
“晚安，”矿工用洪亮的声音回答道。

Gerald guessed where he was. At least, when he came to Whatmore, he would know. He was glad to be on a high road. He walked forward as in a sleep of decision.
杰拉德猜到了他在哪里。至少，当他来到Whatmore的时候，他会知道。他很高兴能走在大道上。他像在沉睡中一样向前走去。

That was Whatmore Village—? Yes, the King’s Head—and there the hall gates. He descended the steep hill almost running. Winding through the hollow, he passed the Grammar School, and came to Willey Green Church. The churchyard! He halted.
那是沃莫尔村——？是的，就是国王的头颅——还有大厅的大门。他几乎是跑着走下陡峭的山坡。蜿蜒穿过山谷，经过文法学校，来到了威利·格林教堂。教堂墓地！他停了下来。

Then in another moment he had clambered up the wall and was going among the graves. Even in this darkness he could see the heaped pallor of old white flowers at his feet. This then was the grave. He stooped down. The flowers were cold and clammy. There was a raw scent of chrysanthemums and tube-roses, deadened. He felt the clay beneath, and shrank, it was so horribly cold and sticky. He stood away in revulsion.
又过了一会儿，他爬上了墙，走进了坟墓。即使在黑暗中，他也能看到脚下堆积着苍白的老花。这就是坟墓。他弯下腰​​。花朵又冷又湿。一股菊花和晚香玉的原始香气扑鼻而来，已经消散了。他摸了摸下面的泥土，收缩了，又冷又粘。他厌恶地站在一旁。

Here was one centre then, here in the complete darkness beside the unseen, raw grave. But there was nothing for him here. No, he had nothing to stay here for. He felt as if some of the clay were sticking cold and unclean, on his heart. No, enough of this.
那时这里就是一个中心，在一片漆黑中，旁边就是一座看不见的、原始的坟墓。但这里没有什么适合他的。不，他留在这里没什么意义。他感觉自己的心上仿佛粘着一些冰冷而不干净的泥土。不，够了。

Where then?—home? Never! It was no use going there. That was less than no use. It could not be done. There was somewhere else to go. Where?
那么去哪儿呢？——家？绝不！去那里是没有用的。那几乎没有用。这是不可能的。还有别的地方可去。在哪里？

A dangerous resolve formed in his heart, like a fixed idea. There was Gudrun—she would be safe in her home. But he could get at her—he would get at her. He would not go back tonight till he had come to her, if it cost him his life. He staked his all on this throw.
一个危险的决心在他心中形成，就像一个固定的想法。有古德伦——她在家里会很安全。但他可以接近她——他一定会接近她。今晚他不会回去，除非他来到她身边，即使这会让他付出生命的代价。他把自己的全部都押在了这一投上。

He set off walking straight across the fields towards Beldover. It was so dark, nobody could ever see him. His feet were wet and cold, heavy with clay. But he went on persistently, like a wind, straight forward, as if to his fate. There were great gaps in his consciousness. He was conscious that he was at Winthorpe hamlet, but quite unconscious how he had got there. And then, as in a dream, he was in the long street of Beldover, with its street-lamps.
他径直穿过田野，朝贝尔多弗走去。天太黑了，没人能看见他。他的脚又湿又冷，沾满了泥土。但他仍执着地前行，如风一般，笔直前行，仿佛听从命运的安排。他的意识出现了巨大的缺口。他意识到自己身处温索普村，但完全不知道自己是如何到达那里的。然后，就像在梦中一样，他来到了贝尔多弗的长街上，街上有路灯。

There was a noise of voices, and of a door shutting loudly, and being barred, and of men talking in the night. The ‘Lord Nelson’ had just closed, and the drinkers were going home. He had better ask one of these where she lived—for he did not know the side streets at all.
夜里传来说话声、关门声和闩锁声，以及人们在夜里说话的声音。 “纳尔逊勋爵”刚刚关门，喝酒的人正在回家。他最好问其中一位她住在哪里——因为他根本不认识那些小巷。

‘Can you tell me where Somerset Drive is?’ he asked of one of the uneven men.
“你能告诉我萨默塞特大道在哪里吗？”他向其中一名身材参差不齐的男子问道。

‘Where what?’ replied the tipsy miner’s voice.
“去哪儿？”醉醺醺的矿工的声音回答道。

‘Somerset Drive.’
“萨默塞特大道。”

‘Somerset Drive!—I’ve heard o’ such a place, but I couldn’t for my life say where it is. Who might you be wanting?’
“萨默塞特大道！——我听说过这样一个地方，但我一辈子也说不出它在哪里。你可能想要谁？

‘Mr Brangwen—William Brangwen.’
“布朗文先生——威廉·布朗文。”

‘William Brangwen—?—?’
“威廉·布朗文——？——？”

‘Who teaches at the Grammar School, at Willey Green—his daughter teaches there too.’
“他在威利格林文法学校任教——他的女儿也在那里教书。”

‘O-o-o-oh, Brangwen! NOW I’ve got you. Of COURSE, William Brangwen! Yes, yes, he’s got two lasses as teachers, aside hisself. Ay, that’s him—that’s him! Why certainly I know where he lives, back your life I do! Yi—WHAT place do they ca’ it?’
‘哦哦，布兰文！现在我找到了你。当然是威廉·布朗文！是的，是的，除了他自己之外，他还有两个姑娘当老师。哎，就是他——就​​是他！为什么我当然知道他住在哪里，我知道你的生活！伊——他们把它放在什么地方？

‘Somerset Drive,’ repeated Gerald patiently. He knew his own colliers fairly well.
“萨默塞特大道。”杰拉尔德耐心地重复道。他对自己的煤矿工人非常了解。

‘Somerset Drive, for certain!’ said the collier, swinging his arm as if catching something up. ‘Somerset Drive—yi! I couldn’t for my life lay hold o’ the lercality o’ the place. Yis, I know the place, to be sure I do—‘
“肯定是萨默塞特大道！”煤矿工人说，挥舞着手臂，好像要抓住什么东西。 “萨默塞特大道——哎呀！我一生都无法掌握这个地方的邪恶。是的，我知道这个地方，当然我知道——”

He turned unsteadily on his feet, and pointed up the dark, nighdeserted road.
他摇摇晃晃地站起来，指着那条漆黑、荒无人烟的道路。

‘You go up theer—an’ you ta’e th’ first—yi, th’ first turnin’ on your left—o’ that side—past Withamses tuffy shop—‘
“你上去——然后你先走——哎，第一个转弯在你左边——那边——经过威瑟姆斯凝灰岩店——”

‘I know,’ said Gerald.
“我知道，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Ay! You go down a bit, past wheer th’ water-man lives—and then Somerset Drive, as they ca’ it, branches off on ‘t right hand side—an’ there’s nowt but three houses in it, no more than three, I believe,—an’ I’m a’most certain as theirs is th’ last—th’ last o’ th’ three—you see—‘
‘哎呀！你往下走一点，经过水工住的地方——然后萨默塞特大道，正如他们所想的那样，在右手边分叉——那里现在只有三栋房子，不超过三栋，我相信，——我非常确定，因为他们是最后一个——最后三个——你看——”

‘Thank you very much,’ said Gerald. ‘Good-night.’
“非常感谢，”杰拉尔德说。 '晚安。'

And he started off, leaving the tipsy man there standing rooted.
然后他就出发了，留下那个喝得醉醺醺的人站在那儿。

Gerald went past the dark shops and houses, most of them sleeping now, and twisted round to the little blind road that ended on a field of darkness. He slowed down, as he neared his goal, not knowing how he should proceed. What if the house were closed in darkness?
杰拉德穿过黑暗的商店和房屋，其中大多数现在都在睡觉，然后拐进一条小盲道，尽头是一片黑暗的田野。当他接近目标时，他放慢了速度，不知道该如何前进。如果房子在黑暗中关闭怎么办？

But it was not. He saw a big lighted window, and heard voices, then a gate banged. His quick ears caught the sound of Birkin’s voice, his keen eyes made out Birkin, with Ursula standing in a pale dress on the step of the garden path. Then Ursula stepped down, and came along the road, holding Birkin’s arm.
但事实并非如此。他看到一扇亮着灯的大窗户，听到了声音，然后大门砰地一声关上了。他敏锐的耳朵捕捉到了伯金的声音，他敏锐的眼睛辨认出了伯金，乌苏拉穿着一件浅色连衣裙站在花园小道的台阶上。然后乌苏拉走下来，挽着伯金的手臂沿着路走来。

Gerald went across into the darkness and they dawdled past him, talking happily, Birkin’s voice low, Ursula’s high and distinct. Gerald went quickly to the house.
杰拉德走进黑暗中，他们从他身边磨蹭着，愉快地交谈着，伯金的声音低沉，乌苏拉的声音高亢而清晰。杰拉尔德快步朝房子走去。

The blinds were drawn before the big, lighted window of the diningroom. Looking up the path at the side he could see the door left open, shedding a soft, coloured light from the hall lamp. He went quickly and silently up the path, and looked up into the hall. There were pictures on the walls, and the antlers of a stag—and the stairs going up on one side—and just near the foot of the stairs the half opened door of the dining-room.
餐厅明亮的大窗户前拉着百叶窗。抬头看旁边的小路，他可以看到门开着，大厅的灯发出柔和的彩色光芒。他快速而安静地沿着小路走去，抬头望向大厅。墙上挂着图画，还有雄鹿的角——一侧是向上的楼梯——靠近楼梯脚的地方，餐厅的门半开着。

With heart drawn fine, Gerald stepped into the hall, whose floor was of coloured tiles, went quickly and looked into the large, pleasant room. In a chair by the fire, the father sat asleep, his head tilted back against the side of the big oak chimney piece, his ruddy face seen foreshortened, the nostrils open, the mouth fallen a little. It would take the merest sound to wake him.
杰拉德心情舒畅，走进铺着彩色瓷砖的大厅，快步走进这间宽敞宜人的房间。父亲坐在火边的一把椅子上睡着了，他的头向后靠在大橡木烟囱的一侧，他红润的脸被缩小了，鼻孔张开，嘴巴有点下垂。只要有一点声音就能把他吵醒。

Gerald stood a second suspended. He glanced down the passage behind him. It was all dark. Again he was suspended. Then he went swiftly upstairs. His senses were so finely, almost supernaturally keen, that he seemed to cast his own will over the half-unconscious house.
杰拉德第二次停职。他扫视身后的通道。天都黑了。他再次被停职。然后他快步上楼了。他的感官如此敏锐，近乎超自然的敏锐，他似乎将自己的意志投射到了这座半昏迷不醒的房子上。

He came to the first landing. There he stood, scarcely breathing. Again, corresponding to the door below, there was a door again. That would be the mother’s room. He could hear her moving about in the candlelight. She would be expecting her husband to come up. He looked along the dark landing.
他来到了第一个平台。他站在那里，几乎没有呼吸。再次，对应着下面的门，又出现了一扇门。那将是母亲的房间。他能听见她在烛光下走动的声音。她正期待着她丈夫的到来。他沿着黑暗的楼梯平台望去。

Then, silently, on infinitely careful feet, he went along the passage, feeling the wall with the extreme tips of his fingers. There was a door. He stood and listened. He could hear two people’s breathing. It was not that. He went stealthily forward. There was another door, slightly open. The room was in darkness. Empty. Then there was the bathroom, he could smell the soap and the heat. Then at the end another bedroom—one soft breathing. This was she.
然后，他默默地、极其小心地沿着通道走去，用指尖摸着墙壁。有一扇门。他站着听。他能听到两个人的呼吸声。事实并非如此。他悄悄地向前走去。还有另一扇门，微开着。房间一片漆黑。空的。然后是浴室，他能闻到肥皂味和热气的味道。尽头是另一间卧室——有轻柔的呼吸声。这就是她。

With an almost occult carefulness he turned the door handle, and opened the door an inch. It creaked slightly. Then he opened it another inch—then another. His heart did not beat, he seemed to create a silence about himself, an obliviousness.
他以近乎神秘的小心翼翼地转动门把手，将门打开了一英寸。它发出轻微的吱吱声。然后他又把它打开一英寸——然后又打开一英寸。他的心脏不再跳动，他似乎让自己陷入了沉默，一种遗忘。

He was in the room. Still the sleeper breathed softly. It was very dark. He felt his way forward inch by inch, with his feet and hands. He touched the bed, he could hear the sleeper. He drew nearer, bending close as if his eyes would disclose whatever there was. And then, very near to his face, to his fear, he saw the round, dark head of a boy.
他在房间里。熟睡的人仍然轻轻地呼吸着。天很黑。他用手脚一寸一寸地摸索前进。他摸了摸床，他能听到睡眠者的声音。他靠近了一些，弯下腰，仿佛他的眼睛会透露出一切。然后，令他恐惧的是，在离他脸很近的地方，他看到了一个男孩圆圆的、黝黑的脑袋。

He recovered, turned round, saw the door ajar, a faint light revealed. And he retreated swiftly, drew the door to without fastening it, and passed rapidly down the passage. At the head of the stairs he hesitated. There was still time to flee.
他回过神来，转过身来，看见门半开着，透出微弱的光。他迅速后退，把门拉上，没有关上，快步穿过通道。到了楼梯口，他犹豫了。还有时间逃跑。

But it was unthinkable. He would maintain his will. He turned past the door of the parental bedroom like a shadow, and was climbing the second flight of stairs. They creaked under his weight—it was exasperating. Ah what disaster, if the mother’s door opened just beneath him, and she saw him! It would have to be, if it were so. He held the control still.
但这是不可想象的。他会坚持自己的意志。他像影子一样穿过父母卧室的门，正在爬第二层楼梯。它们在他的重量下嘎吱作响——真令人恼火。如果母亲的门就在他脚下打开，而她看到了他，那真是一场灾难啊！如果是这样的话，那也一定是这样。他仍然保持着控制权。

He was not quite up these stairs when he heard a quick running of feet below, the outer door was closed and locked, he heard Ursula’s voice, then the father’s sleepy exclamation. He pressed on swiftly to the upper landing.
他还没爬上楼梯，就听到下面有脚步声，外门关着，锁着，他听到乌苏拉的声音，然后是父亲昏昏欲睡的惊呼声。他迅速向上面的平台前进。

Again a door was ajar, a room was empty. Feeling his way forward, with the tips of his fingers, travelling rapidly, like a blind man, anxious lest Ursula should come upstairs, he found another door. There, with his preternaturally fine sense alert, he listened. He heard someone moving in bed. This would be she.
门又半开着，房间里空荡荡的。他用指尖摸索着向前走，像一个盲人一样快速移动，生怕乌苏拉上楼，他发现了另一扇门。在那里，他以异常敏锐的感官倾听着。他听到有人在床上移动。这就是她。

Softly now, like one who has only one sense, the tactile sense, he turned the latch. It clicked. He held still. The bed-clothes rustled. His heart did not beat. Then again he drew the latch back, and very gently pushed the door. It made a sticking noise as it gave.
现在，他轻轻地转动了门闩，就像只有一种感觉——触觉的人一样。咔哒一声。他保持不动。床单沙沙作响。他的心脏没有跳动。然后他又拉开了门闩，轻轻地推开了门。它发出一声​​粘连的声音。

‘Ursula?’ said Gudrun’s voice, frightened. He quickly opened the door and pushed it behind him.
“乌苏拉？”古德伦的声音充满惊恐。他迅速打开门并将其推到身后。

‘Is it you, Ursula?’ came Gudrun’s frightened voice. He heard her sitting up in bed. In another moment she would scream.
“是你吗，乌苏拉？”古德伦惊恐的声音传来。他听到她从床上坐起来。再过一会儿她就会尖叫起来。

‘No, it’s me,’ he said, feeling his way towards her. ‘It is I, Gerald.’
“不，是我，”他一边说，一边摸索着朝她走去。 “是我，杰拉德。”

She sat motionless in her bed in sheer astonishment. She was too astonished, too much taken by surprise, even to be afraid.
她一动不动地坐在床上，完全惊呆了。她太惊讶了，太意外了，甚至没有害怕的余地。

‘Gerald!’ she echoed, in blank amazement. He had found his way to the bed, and his outstretched hand touched her warm breast blindly. She shrank away.
“杰拉德！”她满脸惊讶地重复道。他找到了床边，伸出的手盲目地触碰着她温暖的胸膛。她退缩了。

‘Let me make a light,’ she said, springing out.
“让我点个灯吧，”她说着跳了出来。

He stood perfectly motionless. He heard her touch the match-box, he heard her fingers in their movement. Then he saw her in the light of a match, which she held to the candle. The light rose in the room, then sank to a small dimness, as the flame sank down on the candle, before it mounted again.
他一动不动地站着。他听到她触摸火柴盒，听到她手指的动作。然后他在一根火柴的光亮中看到了她，她把火柴举到了蜡烛上。房间里的光线升起，然后又变得微暗，火焰落在蜡烛上，然后又升起。

She looked at him, as he stood near the other side of the bed. His cap was pulled low over his brow, his black overcoat was buttoned close up to his chin. His face was strange and luminous. He was inevitable as a supernatural being. When she had seen him, she knew. She knew there was something fatal in the situation, and she must accept it. Yet she must challenge him.
当他站在床的另一边时，她看着他。他的帽子拉得很低，盖住额头，黑色大衣的扣子扣到下巴附近。他的脸奇怪而明亮。作为一个超自然的存在，他是不可避免的。当她看到他的时候，她就知道了。她知道情况有些致命，她必须接受它。但她必须挑战他。

‘How did you come up?’ she asked.
“你怎么来的？”她问。

‘I walked up the stairs—the door was open.’
“我走上楼梯——门开着。”

She looked at him.
她看着他。

‘I haven’t closed this door, either,’ he said. She walked swiftly across the room, and closed her door, softly, and locked it. Then she came back.
“我也没有关上这扇门，”他说。她快步穿过房间，轻轻地关上门，并锁上。然后她回来了。

She was wonderful, with startled eyes and flushed cheeks, and her plait of hair rather short and thick down her back, and her long, fine white night-dress falling to her feet.
她很漂亮，有着惊讶的眼睛和通红的脸颊，她的辫子很短，很浓密地垂在背后，她长长的、漂亮的白色睡裙垂到脚边。

She saw that his boots were all clayey, even his trousers were plastered with clay. And she wondered if he had made footprints all the way up. He was a very strange figure, standing in her bedroom, near the tossed bed.
她看到他的靴子上全是泥土，就连裤子上也沾满了泥土。她想知道他是否一路上都留下了脚印。他是一个非常奇怪的人物，站在她的卧室里，靠近翻倒的床。

‘Why have you come?’ she asked, almost querulous.
“你为什么来？”她问道，几乎是在抱怨。

‘I wanted to,’ he replied.
“我想，”他回答道。

And this she could see from his face. It was fate.
这一点她从他的脸上就能看出来。这是命运。

‘You are so muddy,’ she said, in distaste, but gently.
“你太泥泞了。”她厌恶地说，但语气却很温和。

He looked down at his feet.
他低头看着自己的脚。

‘I was walking in the dark,’ he replied. But he felt vividly elated. There was a pause. He stood on one side of the tumbled bed, she on the other. He did not even take his cap from his brows.
“我在黑暗中行走，”他回答道。但他感到非常高兴。一阵停顿。他站在翻倒的床的一侧，她站在另一侧。他甚至没有把眉毛上的帽子拿下来。

‘And what do you want of me,’ she challenged.
“那你想要我做什么？”她挑战道。

He looked aside, and did not answer. Save for the extreme beauty and mystic attractiveness of this distinct, strange face, she would have sent him away. But his face was too wonderful and undiscovered to her. It fascinated her with the fascination of pure beauty, cast a spell on her, like nostalgia, an ache.
他看了一旁，没有回答。如果不是这张独特、陌生的脸庞极其美丽和神秘，她可能会把他送走。但他的脸对她来说太美妙了，而且未被发现。它以纯粹美丽的魅力让她着迷，对她施了魔法，就像怀旧，一种疼痛。

‘What do you want of me?’ she repeated in an estranged voice.
“你想要我做什么？”她用一种陌生的声音重复道。

He pulled off his cap, in a movement of dream-liberation, and went across to her. But he could not touch her, because she stood barefoot in her night-dress, and he was muddy and damp. Her eyes, wide and large and wondering, watched him, and asked him the ultimate question.
他像解梦一样脱下帽子，走到她面前。但他无法碰她，因为她穿着睡衣赤脚站着，而他浑身是泥，湿漉漉的。她的眼睛又大又大，充满好奇地看着他，问了他最后一个问题。

‘I came—because I must,’ he said. ‘Why do you ask?’
“我来了——因为我必须来，”他说。 '你为什么要问？'

She looked at him in doubt and wonder.
她疑惑又惊奇地看着他。

‘I must ask,’ she said.
“我必须问，”她说。

He shook his head slightly.
他轻轻摇头。

‘There is no answer,’ he replied, with strange vacancy.
“没有答案。”他回答道，语气里带着奇怪的空洞。

There was about him a curious, and almost godlike air of simplicity and native directness. He reminded her of an apparition, the young Hermes.
他身上有一种奇怪的、近乎神圣的气质，简单而直接。他让她想起了一个幽灵，年轻的赫尔墨斯。

‘But why did you come to me?’ she persisted.
“但是你为什么来找我？”她坚持道。

‘Because—it has to be so. If there weren’t you in the world, then I shouldn’t be in the world, either.’
因为——事情必须如此。如果世界上没有你，那么我也不应该在这个世界上。”

She stood looking at him, with large, wide, wondering, stricken eyes. His eyes were looking steadily into hers all the time, and he seemed fixed in an odd supernatural steadfastness. She sighed. She was lost now. She had no choice.
她站在那里看着他，睁大眼睛，充满惊奇和震惊。他的眼睛一直盯着她的眼睛，似乎有一种奇怪的、超自然的坚定。她叹了口气。她现在迷路了。她别无选择。

‘Won’t you take off your boots,’ she said. ‘They must be wet.’
“你不把靴子脱掉吗？”她说。 “它们一定是湿的。”

He dropped his cap on a chair, unbuttoned his overcoat, lifting up his chin to unfasten the throat buttons. His short, keen hair was ruffled. He was so beautifully blond, like wheat. He pulled off his overcoat.
他把帽子扔到椅子上，解开大衣的扣子，抬起下巴解开喉部的扣子。他的短发凌乱地凌乱着。他的金发非常漂亮，就像小麦一样。他脱下大衣。

Quickly he pulled off his jacket, pulled loose his black tie, and was unfastening his studs, which were headed each with a pearl. She listened, watching, hoping no one would hear the starched linen crackle. It seemed to snap like pistol shots.
他迅速脱下夹克，解开黑色领带，解开饰有一颗珍珠的耳钉。她听着，看着，希望没有人听到浆过的亚麻布发出的噼啪声。它似乎像手枪射击一样突然响起。

He had come for vindication. She let him hold her in his arms, clasp her close against him. He found in her an infinite relief. Into her he poured all his pent-up darkness and corrosive death, and he was whole again. It was wonderful, marvellous, it was a miracle. This was the everrecurrent miracle of his life, at the knowledge of which he was lost in an ecstasy of relief and wonder. And she, subject, received him as a vessel filled with his bitter potion of death. She had no power at this crisis to resist. The terrible frictional violence of death filled her, and she received it in an ecstasy of subjection, in throes of acute, violent sensation.
他是来寻求平反的。她让他将她抱在怀里，将她紧紧地贴在他身上。他在她身上找到了无限的解脱。他将所有压抑的黑暗和腐蚀性的死亡倾注到她身上，他又变得完整了。这太美妙了，太棒了，这是一个奇迹。这是他一生中不断出现的奇迹，得知这一奇迹后，他陷入了一种如释重负和惊奇的狂喜之中。而她，臣民，把他当作一个装满他的苦涩死亡药水的容器来接待。面对这样的危机，她根本没有反抗的能力。死亡带来的可怕的摩擦力充满了她，她在一种服从的狂喜中，在剧烈的感觉的剧痛中接受了它。

As he drew nearer to her, he plunged deeper into her enveloping soft warmth, a wonderful creative heat that penetrated his veins and gave him life again. He felt himself dissolving and sinking to rest in the bath of her living strength. It seemed as if her heart in her breast were a second unconquerable sun, into the glow and creative strength of which he plunged further and further. All his veins, that were murdered and lacerated, healed softly as life came pulsing in, stealing invisibly in to him as if it were the all-powerful effluence of the sun. His blood, which seemed to have been drawn back into death, came ebbing on the return, surely, beautifully, powerfully.
当他靠近她时，他更深地沉浸在她包裹着的柔软温暖中，一种美妙的创造力的热量渗透到他的血管中，并再次赋予了他生命。他感觉自己正在溶解，沉入她生命力的沐浴之中。她胸中的心仿佛是第二个不可战胜的太阳，他在其中的光芒和创造力中越陷越深。他所有被谋杀和撕裂的血管都在生命的脉动中轻轻地愈合，就像太阳的全能光芒一样，无形地潜入了他的体内。他的血液似乎被抽回到了死亡之中，在回归时确实、美丽而有力地消退了。

He felt his limbs growing fuller and flexible with life, his body gained an unknown strength. He was a man again, strong and rounded. And he was a child, so soothed and restored and full of gratitude.
他感觉自己的四肢随着生命而变得更加丰满和灵活，身体获得了一种未知的力量。他又变回一个男人了，强壮而圆润。他还是个孩子，如此安抚、恢复并充满感激之情。

And she, she was the great bath of life, he worshipped her. Mother and substance of all life she was. And he, child and man, received of her and was made whole. His pure body was almost killed. But the miraculous, soft effluence of her breast suffused over him, over his seared, damaged brain, like a healing lymph, like a soft, soothing flow of life itself, perfect as if he were bathed in the womb again.
而她，她是生命的大浴场，他崇拜她。她是母亲，也是一切生命的实质。而他，作为一个孩子和一个男人，接受了她并痊愈了。他的纯净之躯差点就被杀死了。但她的乳房神奇而柔和的流出物弥漫在他身上，弥漫在他烧焦、受损的大脑上，就像治愈的淋巴液，就像生命本身柔软、舒缓的流动，完美得就像他再次沐浴在子宫里一样。

His brain was hurt, seared, the tissue was as if destroyed. He had not known how hurt he was, how his tissue, the very tissue of his brain was damaged by the corrosive flood of death. Now, as the healing lymph of her effluence flowed through him, he knew how destroyed he was, like a plant whose tissue is burst from inwards by a frost.
他的大脑受伤了，烧焦了，组织就像被摧毁了一样。他不知道自己受到了多大的伤害，他的组织，他的大脑组织是如何被死亡的腐蚀性洪流所破坏的。现在，当她排出的具有治疗作用的淋巴液流经他时，他知道自己受到了多么严重的破坏，就像一株植物的组织被霜冻从内部破裂一样。

He buried his small, hard head between her breasts, and pressed her breasts against him with his hands. And she with quivering hands pressed his head against her, as he lay suffused out, and she lay fully conscious. The lovely creative warmth flooded through him like a sleep of fecundity within the womb. Ah, if only she would grant him the flow of this living effluence, he would be restored, he would be complete again. He was afraid she would deny him before it was finished. Like a child at the breast, he cleaved intensely to her, and she could not put him away. And his seared, ruined membrane relaxed, softened, that which was seared and stiff and blasted yielded again, became soft and flexible, palpitating with new life. He was infinitely grateful, as to God, or as an infant is at its mother’s breast. He was glad and grateful like a delirium, as he felt his own wholeness come over him again, as he felt the full, unutterable sleep coming over him, the sleep of complete exhaustion and restoration.
他把又小又硬的头埋在她的乳房之间，用手将她的乳房压在他身上。当他躺在床上时，她用颤抖的双手把他的头按在自己身上，而她则完全清醒。可爱的创意温暖涌入他的全身，就像子宫里的生育力睡眠一样。啊，只要她能赐予他这股生命之流，他就会恢复，他就会再次完整。他担心事情还没完成，她就会否认他。就像一个孩子在怀里，他紧紧地依偎着她，她无法把他推开。他那被烧焦、毁坏的膜放松、软化，那被烧焦、僵硬、炸裂的膜又屈服了，变得柔软而有弹性，充满了新的生命。他无限感激，就像对上帝，或者像婴儿在母亲的怀里一样。他像精神错乱一样高兴和感激，因为他感到自己的完整再次降临到他身上，因为他感到完全的、难以言喻的睡眠降临到他身上，完全疲惫和恢复的睡眠。

But Gudrun lay wide awake, destroyed into perfect consciousness. She lay motionless, with wide eyes staring motionless into the darkness, whilst he was sunk away in sleep, his arms round her.
但古德伦完全清醒地躺着，完全失去了意识。她一动不动地躺着，睁大眼睛一动不动地凝视着黑暗，而他则用双臂搂着她，沉沉睡去。

She seemed to be hearing waves break on a hidden shore, long, slow, gloomy waves, breaking with the rhythm of fate, so monotonously that it seemed eternal. This endless breaking of slow, sullen waves of fate held her life a possession, whilst she lay with dark, wide eyes looking into the darkness. She could see so far, as far as eternity—yet she saw nothing. She was suspended in perfect consciousness—and of what was she conscious?
她仿佛听见海浪拍打着隐秘的海岸，悠长、缓慢、阴郁的波浪，打破了命运的节奏，单调得仿佛永恒。命运的缓慢、阴沉的波浪无休无止地打破，占据了她的生命，而她躺在那里，睁着漆黑的大眼睛，望着黑暗。她可以看得很远，远到永恒——但她什么也看不见。她悬浮在完美的意识之中——她意识到了什么？

This mood of extremity, when she lay staring into eternity, utterly suspended, and conscious of everything, to the last limits, passed and left her uneasy. She had lain so long motionless. She moved, she became self-conscious. She wanted to look at him, to see him.
当她躺在那里，凝视着永恒，完全悬浮，意识到一切，直到最后的极限时，这种极端的情绪消失了，让她感到不安。她一动不动地躺了这么久。她动了，她变得不自在。她想看看他，想看看他。

But she dared not make a light, because she knew he would wake, and she did not want to break his perfect sleep, that she knew he had got of her.
但她不敢点灯，因为她知道他会醒来，她不想打破他完美的睡眠，因为她知道他已经摆脱了她。

She disengaged herself, softly, and rose up a little to look at him. There was a faint light, it seemed to her, in the room. She could just distinguish his features, as he slept the perfect sleep. In this darkness, she seemed to see him so distinctly. But he was far off, in another world. Ah, she could shriek with torment, he was so far off, and perfected, in another world. She seemed to look at him as at a pebble far away under clear dark water. And here was she, left with all the anguish of consciousness, whilst he was sunk deep into the other element of mindless, remote, living shadow-gleam. He was beautiful, far-off, and perfected. They would never be together. Ah, this awful, inhuman distance which would always be interposed between her and the other being!
她轻轻地挣脱开来，稍微站起身来看着他。她觉得房间里有微弱的光。她只能辨认出他的面容，因为他睡得很香。在这黑暗之中，她似乎看清了他。但他却在遥远的地方，在另一个世界。啊，她可以痛苦地尖叫，他是如此遥远，完美，在另一个世界。她看着他，就像看着远处清澈黑暗的水下的一颗鹅卵石。她就在这里，留下了意识中的所有痛苦，而他却深深地陷入了另一个无意识的、遥远的、活生生的阴影的元素中。他美丽、遥远、完美。他们永远不会在一起。啊，这种可怕的、不人道的距离总是介于她和另一个人之间！

There was nothing to do but to lie still and endure. She felt an overwhelming tenderness for him, and a dark, under-stirring of jealous hatred, that he should lie so perfect and immune, in an other-world, whilst she was tormented with violent wakefulness, cast out in the outer darkness.
没有什么可做的，只能静静地躺着忍耐。她对他感到一种压倒性的柔情，以及一种黑暗的、隐隐约约的嫉妒仇恨，因为他竟然在另一个世界里如此完美和免疫，而她却因猛烈的清醒而受到折磨，被驱逐在外面的黑暗中。

She lay in intense and vivid consciousness, an exhausting superconsciousness. The church clock struck the hours, it seemed to her, in quick succession. She heard them distinctly in the tension of her vivid consciousness. And he slept as if time were one moment, unchanging and unmoving.
她躺在强烈而生动的意识中，一种令人筋疲力尽的超意识。在她看来，教堂的钟敲响的时间很快。她在她生动的意识的紧张中清楚地听到了他们的声音。而他睡着​​的时候，仿佛时间就是一瞬间，一成不变，一动不动。

She was exhausted, wearied. Yet she must continue in this state of violent active superconsciousness. She was conscious of everything—her childhood, her girlhood, all the forgotten incidents, all the unrealised influences and all the happenings she had not understood, pertaining to herself, to her family, to her friends, her lovers, her acquaintances, everybody. It was as if she drew a glittering rope of knowledge out of the sea of darkness, drew and drew and drew it out of the fathomless depths of the past, and still it did not come to an end, there was no end to it, she must haul and haul at the rope of glittering consciousness, pull it out phosphorescent from the endless depths of the unconsciousness, till she was weary, aching, exhausted, and fit to break, and yet she had not done.
她已经精疲力尽、疲惫不堪了。然而她必须继续处于这种暴力活跃的超意识状态。她对一切都了如指掌——她的童年，她的少女时代，所有被遗忘的事件，所有未实现的影响以及所有她不理解的事情，关于她自己，她的家人，她的朋友，她的爱人，她的熟人，每个人。就好像她从黑暗的海洋中拉出一条闪闪发光的知识绳，从过去深不可测的深处拉啊拉啊拉，但它仍然没有结束，没有结束，她必须拉啊拉啊拉那条闪烁着意识的绳子，把它从无边无际的无意识深处拉出来，发出磷光，直到她疲倦、疼痛、精疲力竭，几乎要折断为止，但她还没有完成。

Ah, if only she might wake him! She turned uneasily. When could she rouse him and send him away? When could she disturb him? And she relapsed into her activity of automatic consciousness, that would never end.
啊，要是她能叫醒他就好了！她不安地转身。她什么时候才能叫醒他，送他走？她什么时候才能打扰他？她又陷入自动意识的活动中，这种活动永远不会结束。

But the time was drawing near when she could wake him. It was like a release. The clock had struck four, outside in the night. Thank God the night had passed almost away. At five he must go, and she would be released. Then she could relax and fill her own place. Now she was driven up against his perfect sleeping motion like a knife white-hot on a grindstone. There was something monstrous about him, about his juxtaposition against her.
但她能叫醒他的时间已经快到了。这就像一种释放。外面已是夜色，时钟已敲响四点。感谢上帝，这一夜已经过去了。五点钟他必须走，然后她就会被释放。然后她就可以放松并占据自己的位置。现在，她就像磨刀石上一把白热化的刀子一样，被他完美的睡眠动作所逼迫。他身上有一种可怕的东西，他与她的并列。

The last hour was the longest. And yet, at last it passed. Her heart leapt with relief—yes, there was the slow, strong stroke of the church clock—at last, after this night of eternity. She waited to catch each slow, fatal reverberation. ‘Three—four—five!’ There, it was finished. A weight rolled off her.
最后一个小时是最长的。然而，最后还是过去了。她的心如释重负地跳了起来——是的，教堂的钟声缓慢而有力地敲响了——终于，在这个永恒的夜晚之后。她等着捕捉每一个缓慢而致命的回响。 “三——四——五！”就这样，一切都完成了。一个重担从她身上滚了下来。

She raised herself, leaned over him tenderly, and kissed him. She was sad to wake him. After a few moments, she kissed him again. But he did not stir. The darling, he was so deep in sleep! What a shame to take him out of it. She let him lie a little longer. But he must go—he must really go.
她站起身来，温柔地靠在他身上，吻住了他。她很伤心地叫醒了他。过了一会儿，她又吻了他。但他没有动。亲爱的，他睡得真沉啊！把他带出去真是太可惜了。她让他再躺一会儿。但他必须走——他真的必须走。

With full over-tenderness she took his face between her hands, and kissed his eyes. The eyes opened, he remained motionless, looking at her. Her heart stood still. To hide her face from his dreadful opened eyes, in the darkness, she bent down and kissed him, whispering:
她极其温柔地捧起他的脸，亲吻他的眼睛。眼睛睁开，他一动不动，看着她。她的心静止了。为了掩饰自己的脸，让他在黑暗中睁开可怕的眼睛，她弯下腰吻了他，低声说道：

‘You must go, my love.’
“你必须走，亲爱的。”

But she was sick with terror, sick.
但她因恐惧而感到恶心，恶心。

He put his arms round her. Her heart sank.
他用双臂搂住她。她的心沉了下去。

‘But you must go, my love. It’s late.’
“但是你必须走，我的爱人。现在已经晚了。'

‘What time is it?’ he said.
“现在几点了？”他说。

Strange, his man’s voice. She quivered. It was an intolerable oppression to her.
奇怪的是，他男人的声音。她颤抖着。这对她来说是一种难以忍受的压迫。

‘Past five o’clock,’ she said.
“五点多了，”她说。

But he only closed his arms round her again. Her heart cried within her in torture. She disengaged herself firmly.
但他只是再次张开双臂搂住她。她的心在痛苦中哭泣。她坚定地挣脱了束缚。

‘You really must go,’ she said.
“你真的必须走了，”她说。

‘Not for a minute,’ he said.
“一分钟都没有，”他说。

She lay still, nestling against him, but unyielding.
她静静地躺着，依偎着他，但不屈服。

‘Not for a minute,’ he repeated, clasping her closer.
“一分钟都不行，”他重复道，把她抱得更紧。

‘Yes,’ she said, unyielding, ‘I’m afraid if you stay any longer.’
“是的，”她不屈不挠地说，“如果你再呆下去，我会担心。”

There was a certain coldness in her voice that made him release her, and she broke away, rose and lit the candle. That then was the end.
她的声音里有一丝冰冷，这让他松开了她，她挣脱开来，站起来点燃了蜡烛。那么就结束了。

He got up. He was warm and full of life and desire. Yet he felt a little bit ashamed, humiliated, putting on his clothes before her, in the candle-light. For he felt revealed, exposed to her, at a time when she was in some way against him. It was all very difficult to understand. He dressed himself quickly, without collar or tie. Still he felt full and complete, perfected. She thought it humiliating to see a man dressing: the ridiculous shirt, the ridiculous trousers and braces. But again an idea saved her.
他起来了。他很温暖，充满生机和欲望。然而，在烛光下，当着她的面穿上衣服时，他还是感到有点羞愧、羞辱。因为当她在某种程度上反对他时，他感到自己被暴露了，暴露在她面前。这一切都很难理解。他迅速穿好衣服，没有领子，也没有领带。但他仍然感到充实、完整、完美。她认为看到一个男人的穿着是一种耻辱：可笑的衬衫、可笑的裤子和背带。但一个想法再次拯救了她。

‘It is like a workman getting up to go to work,’ thought Gudrun. ‘And I am like a workman’s wife.’ But an ache like nausea was upon her: a nausea of him.
“这就像一个工人起床去上班，”古德伦想。 “而我就像一个工人的妻子。”但她感到一阵恶心般的疼痛：对他的厌恶。

He pushed his collar and tie into his overcoat pocket. Then he sat down and pulled on his boots. They were sodden, as were his socks and trouser-bottoms. But he himself was quick and warm.
他把衣领和领带塞进大衣口袋里。然后他坐下来，穿上靴子。它们都湿透了，他的袜子和裤裤也是如此。但他本人却又敏捷又热情。

‘Perhaps you ought to have put your boots on downstairs,’ she said.
“也许你应该在楼下穿上靴子，”她说。

At once, without answering, he pulled them off again, and stood holding them in his hand. She had thrust her feet into slippers, and flung a loose robe round her. She was ready. She looked at him as he stood waiting, his black coat buttoned to the chin, his cap pulled down, his boots in his hand. And the passionate almost hateful fascination revived in her for a moment. It was not exhausted. His face was so warm-looking, wide-eyed and full of newness, so perfect. She felt old, old. She went to him heavily, to be kissed. He kissed her quickly. She wished his warm, expressionless beauty did not so fatally put a spell on her, compel her and subjugate her. It was a burden upon her, that she resented, but could not escape. Yet when she looked at his straight man’s brows, and at his rather small, well-shaped nose, and at his blue, indifferent eyes, she knew her passion for him was not yet satisfied, perhaps never could be satisfied. Only now she was weary, with an ache like nausea. She wanted him gone.
他立即没有回答，又把它们脱下来，手里拿着它们站着。她把脚穿上拖鞋，披上一件宽松的长袍。她已经准备好了。她看着他站在那里等待，他的黑色外套扣子扣到下巴，帽子拉低，手里拿着靴子。一时之间，那种充满激情、近乎仇恨的迷恋又在她心中重新燃起。它并没有耗尽。他的脸看起来是那么温暖，睁大眼睛，充满新鲜感，那么完美。她感觉自己老了，老了。她重重地走向他，想要被他亲吻。他飞快地吻了她。她希望他那温暖、面无表情的美貌不会对她产生如此致命的魔咒、强迫她、征服她。这是她身上的负担，她怨恨，却又无法逃避。可当她看着他笔直的眉头，看着他那挺小挺拔的鼻子，看着他那双淡漠的蓝眼睛，她就知道，她对他的热情还没有得到满足，或许永远都无法满足。只是现在她感到很疲倦，还有一种像恶心一样的疼痛。她想让他走。

They went downstairs quickly. It seemed they made a prodigious noise. He followed her as, wrapped in her vivid green wrap, she preceded him with the light. She suffered badly with fear, lest her people should be roused. He hardly cared. He did not care now who knew. And she hated this in him. One MUST be cautious. One must preserve oneself.
他们快步下了楼。他们似乎发出了巨大的噪音。他跟在她身后，而她裹着鲜艳的绿色裹布，带着光走在他前面。她因恐惧而饱受折磨，唯恐她的人民被唤醒。他几乎不在乎。他现在不在乎谁知道。她讨厌他的这一点。人必须谨慎。人必须保护自己。

She led the way to the kitchen. It was neat and tidy, as the woman had left it. He looked up at the clock—twenty minutes past five Then he sat down on a chair to put on his boots. She waited, watching his every movement. She wanted it to be over, it was a great nervous strain on her.
她带路去了厨房。房间干净整洁，就像女人离开时一样。他抬头看了看时钟——五点二十分，然后他坐在椅子上穿上靴子。她等待着，注视着他的一举一动。她希望一切都结束，这对她来说是一种巨大的紧张。

He stood up—she unbolted the back door, and looked out. A cold, raw night, not yet dawn, with a piece of a moon in the vague sky. She was glad she need not go out.
他站起来——她打开后门，向外望去。寒冷、寒冷的夜晚，黎明尚未到来，朦胧的天空中挂着一轮月亮。她很高兴自己不用出去。

‘Good-bye then,’ he murmured.
“那么再见，”他低声说道。

‘I’ll come to the gate,’ she said.
“我会到门口去，”她说。

And again she hurried on in front, to warn him of the steps. And at the gate, once more she stood on the step whilst he stood below her.
她再次急忙走在前面，警告他有脚步声。到了门口，她再次站在台阶上，而他站在她下面。

‘Good-bye,’ she whispered.
“再见，”她低声说道。

He kissed her dutifully, and turned away.
他尽职尽责地吻了她，然后转身走开。

She suffered torments hearing his firm tread going so distinctly down the road. Ah, the insensitiveness of that firm tread!
听到他坚定的脚步声如此清晰地走在路上，她感到很痛苦。啊，那坚定的脚步是多么麻木不仁啊！

She closed the gate, and crept quickly and noiselessly back to bed. When she was in her room, and the door closed, and all safe, she breathed freely, and a great weight fell off her. She nestled down in bed, in the groove his body had made, in the warmth he had left. And excited, worn-out, yet still satisfied, she fell soon into a deep, heavy sleep.
她关上门，迅速无声地爬回床上。当她回到自己的房间，门关上，一切安全时，她自由地呼吸，巨大的重量从她身上掉了下来。她依偎在床上，在他身体留下的凹槽里，在他留下的温暖里。她兴奋、疲惫，但仍心满意足，很快就陷入了沉沉的睡眠中。

Gerald walked quickly through the raw darkness of the coming dawn. He met nobody. His mind was beautifully still and thoughtless, like a still pool, and his body full and warm and rich. He went quickly along towards Shortlands, in a grateful self-sufficiency.
杰拉德快步穿过即将到来的黎明的黑暗。他没有遇见任何人。他的心灵美丽而宁静，无忧无虑，就像一汪平静的池子，他的身体饱满、温暖、丰富。他怀着一种自给自足的感激之情，迅速朝肖特兰兹走去。

CHAPTER XXV
第二十五章

MARRIAGE OR NOT
结婚与否

The Brangwen family was going to move from Beldover. It was necessary now for the father to be in town.
布兰文一家要从贝尔多弗搬走。现在父亲必须进城了。

Birkin had taken out a marriage licence, yet Ursula deferred from day to day. She would not fix any definite time—she still wavered. Her month’s notice to leave the Grammar School was in its third week. Christmas was not far off.
伯金已经领了结婚证，但乌苏拉却日复一日地推迟。她不会确定任何具体的时间——她仍然犹豫不决。她一个月收到离开文法学校的通知已经是第三周了。圣诞节已经不远了。

Gerald waited for the Ursula-Birkin marriage. It was something crucial to him.
杰拉德等待着乌苏拉和伯金的婚礼。这对他来说是至关重要的事情。

‘Shall we make it a double-barrelled affair?’ he said to Birkin one day.
“我们可以把它变成一场双管齐下的活动吗？”有一天，他对伯金说道。

‘Who for the second shot?’ asked Birkin.
“第二枪是谁？”伯金问道。

‘Gudrun and me,’ said Gerald, the venturesome twinkle in his eyes.
“古德伦和我，”杰拉德说道，眼中闪烁着冒险的光芒。

Birkin looked at him steadily, as if somewhat taken aback.
伯金定定地看着他，似乎有些吃惊。

‘Serious—or joking?’ he asked.
“是认真的——还是开玩笑？”他问道。

‘Oh, serious. Shall I? Shall Gudrun and I rush in along with you?’
哦，说真的。我可以吗？我和古珍要和你一起冲进去吗？

‘Do by all means,’ said Birkin. ‘I didn’t know you’d got that length.’
“无论如何，”伯金说。 “我不知道你有那么长。”

‘What length?’ said Gerald, looking at the other man, and laughing.
“多长？”杰拉德看着另一个人，笑着说道。

‘Oh yes, we’ve gone all the lengths.’
“哦，是的，我们已经竭尽全力了。”

‘There remains to put it on a broad social basis, and to achieve a high moral purpose,’ said Birkin.
伯金说，“仍然需要将其置于广泛的社会基础上，并实现崇高的道德目标。”

‘Something like that: the length and breadth and height of it,’ replied Gerald, smiling.
“类似这样的东西：它的长度、宽度和高度，”杰拉尔德微笑着回答。

‘Oh well,’ said Birkin,’ it’s a very admirable step to take, I should say.’
“哦，好吧，”伯金说，“我应该说，这是非常令人钦佩的一步。”

Gerald looked at him closely.
杰拉尔德仔细地看着他。

‘Why aren’t you enthusiastic?’ he asked. ‘I thought you were such dead nuts on marriage.’
“你为什么不热情？”他问。 “我以为你对婚姻非常着迷。”

Birkin lifted his shoulders.
伯金抬起肩膀。

‘One might as well be dead nuts on noses. There are all sorts of noses, snub and otherwise-’
“一个人还不如鼻子发疯。”有各种各样的鼻子、冷落和其他——”

Gerald laughed.
杰拉尔德笑了。

‘And all sorts of marriage, also snub and otherwise?’ he said.
“还有各种各样的婚姻，还有冷落和其他方式吗？”他说。

‘That’s it.’
'就是这样。'

‘And you think if I marry, it will be snub?’ asked Gerald quizzically, his head a little on one side.
“你认为如果我结婚了，就会受到冷落吗？”杰拉尔德疑惑地问道，他的头有点偏向一侧。

Birkin laughed quickly.
伯金很快笑了起来。

‘How do I know what it will be!’ he said. ‘Don’t lambaste me with my own parallels-’
“我怎么知道会是什么！”他说。 “别用我自己的相似之处来痛斥我——”

Gerald pondered a while.
杰拉德沉思了一会儿。

‘But I should like to know your opinion, exactly,’ he said.
“但我想确切地知道你的意见，”他说。

‘On your marriage?—or marrying? Why should you want my opinion? I’ve got no opinions. I’m not interested in legal marriage, one way or another. It’s a mere question of convenience.’
“关于你的婚姻？——还是结婚？你为什么要征求我的意见？我没有意见。无论如何，我对合法婚姻不感兴趣。这只是一个方便的问题。

Still Gerald watched him closely.
杰拉德仍然密切注视着他。

‘More than that, I think,’ he said seriously. ‘However you may be bored by the ethics of marriage, yet really to marry, in one’s own personal case, is something critical, final-’
“我想，还不止这些，”他严肃地说。 “然而你可能对婚姻道德感到厌倦，但就个人而言，真正结婚是至关重要的、最终的——”

‘You mean there is something final in going to the registrar with a woman?’
“你的意思是说，和一个女人一起去登记处有最后的决定吗？”

‘If you’re coming back with her, I do,’ said Gerald. ‘It is in some way irrevocable.’
“如果你愿意和她一起回来，我愿意，”杰拉德说。 “从某种程度上来说，这是不可撤销的。”

‘Yes, I agree,’ said Birkin.
“是的，我同意，”伯金说。

‘No matter how one regards legal marriage, yet to enter into the married state, in one’s own personal instance, is final-’
“无论如何看待合法婚姻，但进入婚姻状态，就个人而言，就是最终的——”

‘I believe it is,’ said Birkin, ‘somewhere.’
“我相信，”伯金说，“在某个地方。”

‘The question remains then, should one do it,’ said Gerald.
杰拉德说：“问题仍然是，我们是否应该这样做。”

Birkin watched him narrowly, with amused eyes.
伯金用有趣的眼神仔细地看着他。

‘You are like Lord Bacon, Gerald,’ he said. ‘You argue it like a lawyer—or like Hamlet’s to-be-or-not-to-be. If I were you I would NOT marry: but ask Gudrun, not me. You’re not marrying me, are you?’
“你就像培根勋爵，杰拉德，”他说。 “你像律师一样争论，或者像哈姆雷特的‘生存或毁灭’一样。”如果我是你，我不会结婚：但问古德伦，而不是我。你不会嫁给我吧？

Gerald did not heed the latter part of this speech.
杰拉尔德没有留意演讲的后半部分。

‘Yes,’ he said, ‘one must consider it coldly. It is something critical. One comes to the point where one must take a step in one direction or another. And marriage is one direction-’
“是的，”他说，“我们必须冷静地考虑这一点。这是很关键的事情。人们到了必须向一个方向或另一个方向迈出一步的地步。婚姻是一个方向——”

‘And what is the other?’ asked Birkin quickly.
“另一个是什么？”伯金很快问道。

Gerald looked up at him with hot, strangely-conscious eyes, that the other man could not understand.
杰拉德抬起头，用炽热而奇怪的眼神看着他，但对方无法理解。

‘I can’t say,’ he replied. ‘If I knew THAT—‘ He moved uneasily on his feet, and did not finish.
“我不能说，”他回答道。 “如果我知道的话——”他不安地移动着脚步，但没有说完。

‘You mean if you knew the alternative?’ asked Birkin. ‘And since you don’t know it, marriage is a PIS ALLER.’
“你的意思是你是否知道替代方案？”伯金问道。 “既然你不知道，婚姻就是一件大事。”

Gerald looked up at Birkin with the same hot, constrained eyes.
杰拉德抬起头，用同样炽热、压抑的目光看着伯金。

‘One does have the feeling that marriage is a PIS ALLER,’ he admitted.
他承认，“人们确实有一种感觉，婚姻是一件很糟糕的事情”。

‘Then don’t do it,’ said Birkin. ‘I tell you,’ he went on, ‘the same as I’ve said before, marriage in the old sense seems to me repulsive. EGOISME A DEUX is nothing to it. It’s a sort of tacit hunting in couples: the world all in couples, each couple in its own little house, watching its own little interests, and stewing in its own little privacy—it’s the most repulsive thing on earth.’
“那就别这么做了，”伯金说。 “我告诉你，”他继续说道，“就像我以前说过的那样，旧意义上的婚姻在我看来是令人厌恶的。 EGOISME A DEUX 对此毫无意义。这是一种夫妻间的默契狩猎：世界都是夫妻，每对夫妻都在自己的小房子里，关注着自己的小利益，在自己的小隐私中苦恼——这是地球上最令人厌恶的事情。

‘I quite agree,’ said Gerald. ‘There’s something inferior about it. But as I say, what’s the alternative.’
“我完全同意，”杰拉尔德说。 ‘这里面有一些劣质的东西。但正如我所说，还有什么选择呢？

‘One should avoid this HOME instinct. It’s not an instinct, it’s a habit of cowardliness. One should never have a HOME.’
“人们应该避免这种回家的本能。这不是一种本能，而是一种懦弱的习惯。一个人永远不应该有一个家。”

‘I agree really,’ said Gerald. ‘But there’s no alternative.’
“我真的同意，”杰拉尔德说。 “但别无选择。”

‘We’ve got to find one. I do believe in a permanent union between a man and a woman. Chopping about is merely an exhaustive process. But a permanent relation between a man and a woman isn’t the last word—it certainly isn’t.’
‘我们必须找到一个。我确实相信男人和女人之间有永久的结合。砍伐只是一个详尽的过程。但男人和女人之间的永久关系并不是最终的结论——当然不是。”

‘Quite,’ said Gerald.
“确实如此，”杰拉尔德说。

‘In fact,’ said Birkin, ‘because the relation between man and woman is made the supreme and exclusive relationship, that’s where all the tightness and meanness and insufficiency comes in.’
“事实上，”伯金说，“因为男人和女人之间的关系被赋予了至高无上和排他性的关系，所以所有的紧张、卑鄙和不足就出现了。”

‘Yes, I believe you,’ said Gerald.
“是的，我相信你，”杰拉尔德说。

‘You’ve got to take down the love-and-marriage ideal from its pedestal. We want something broader. I believe in the ADDITIONAL perfect relationship between man and man—additional to marriage.’
“你必须把爱情和婚姻的理想从其基座上取下来。我们想要更广泛的东西。我相信除了婚姻之外，人与人之间还存在着额外的完美关系。

‘I can never see how they can be the same,’ said Gerald.
“我永远不明白它们怎么会是一样的，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Not the same—but equally important, equally creative, equally sacred, if you like.’
“不一样——但同样重要，同样有创造力，同样神圣，如果你愿意的话。”

‘I know,’ said Gerald, ‘you believe something like that. Only I can’t FEEL it, you see.’ He put his hand on Birkin’s arm, with a sort of deprecating affection. And he smiled as if triumphantly.
“我知道，”杰拉尔德说，“你相信这样的事情。你看，只是我感觉不到。”他把手放在伯金的手臂上，带着一种不以为然的感情。他微笑着，仿佛得意洋洋。

He was ready to be doomed. Marriage was like a doom to him. He was willing to condemn himself in marriage, to become like a convict condemned to the mines of the underworld, living no life in the sun, but having a dreadful subterranean activity. He was willing to accept this. And marriage was the seal of his condemnation. He was willing to be sealed thus in the underworld, like a soul damned but living forever in damnation. But he would not make any pure relationship with any other soul. He could not. Marriage was not the committing of himself into a relationship with Gudrun. It was a committing of himself in acceptance of the established world, he would accept the established order, in which he did not livingly believe, and then he would retreat to the underworld for his life. This he would do.
他已经做好了注定失败的准备。婚姻对他来说就像是厄运。他愿意在婚姻中谴责自己，成为一个被判入地下矿井的囚犯，过着没有阳光的生活，却从事着可怕的地下活动。他愿意接受这一点。而婚姻就是他受到谴责的印记。他愿意就这样被封印在冥界，就像一个被诅咒的灵魂，却永远活在地狱之中。但他不会与任何其他灵魂建立任何纯粹的关系。他不能。婚姻并不是他自己与古德伦的关系。这是他自己对既定世界的承诺，他会接受他并不真正相信的既定秩序，然后他会退回到阴间过他的生活。他会这么做。

The other way was to accept Rupert’s offer of alliance, to enter into the bond of pure trust and love with the other man, and then subsequently with the woman. If he pledged himself with the man he would later be able to pledge himself with the woman: not merely in legal marriage, but in absolute, mystic marriage.
另一种方式是接受鲁珀特的联盟提议，与另一个男人建立纯粹的信任和爱的纽带，然后与女人建立纯粹的信任和爱的纽带。如果他向男人宣誓，他以后就可以向女人宣誓：不仅是合法的婚姻，而且是绝对的、神秘的婚姻。

Yet he could not accept the offer. There was a numbness upon him, a numbness either of unborn, absent volition, or of atrophy. Perhaps it was the absence of volition. For he was strangely elated at Rupert’s offer. Yet he was still more glad to reject it, not to be committed.
但他无法接受这个提议。他身上有一种麻木感，这种麻木感要么是未出生的、缺乏意志的，要么是萎缩的。也许是缺乏意志。因为他对鲁珀特的提议感到异常高兴。但他更乐意拒绝，而不是承诺。

CHAPTER XXVI
第二十六章

A CHAIR
一把椅子

There was a jumble market every Monday afternoon in the old market-place in town. Ursula and Birkin strayed down there one afternoon. They had been talking of furniture, and they wanted to see if there was any fragment they would like to buy, amid the heaps of rubbish collected on the cobble-stones.
镇上的旧市场每周一下午都会举办杂货市场。一天下午，乌苏拉和伯金在那里闲逛。他们一直在谈论家具，他们想看看鹅卵石上堆积的垃圾堆里有没有他们想买的碎片。

The old market-square was not very large, a mere bare patch of granite setts, usually with a few fruit-stalls under a wall. It was in a poor quarter of the town. Meagre houses stood down one side, there was a hosiery factory, a great blank with myriad oblong windows, at the end, a street of little shops with flagstone pavement down the other side, and, for a crowning monument, the public baths, of new red brick, with a clock-tower. The people who moved about seemed stumpy and sordid, the air seemed to smell rather dirty, there was a sense of many mean streets ramifying off into warrens of meanness. Now and again a great chocolate-and-yellow tramcar ground round a difficult bend under the hosiery factory.
旧的集市广场不是很大，只是一块光秃秃的花岗岩台地，墙下通常有几个水果摊。那是在镇上的一个贫困地区。简陋的房屋矗立在一侧，有一家袜厂，一块巨大的空地，有无数的长方形窗户，尽头是一条小商店街，另一侧是石板路，还有，作为一座最高的纪念碑，公共浴室，新红砖，有钟楼。走来走去的人看起来又矮又脏，空气似乎闻起来很脏，有一种许多肮脏的街道延伸成肮脏的乱七八糟的感觉。时不时，一辆巨大的巧克力色和黄色的有轨电车在袜厂下面的一个艰难的弯道上行驶。

Ursula was superficially thrilled when she found herself out among the common people, in the jumbled place piled with old bedding, heaps of old iron, shabby crockery in pale lots, muffled lots of unthinkable clothing. She and Birkin went unwillingly down the narrow aisle between the rusty wares. He was looking at the goods, she at the people.
当乌苏拉发现自己置身于普通人之中时，她表面上感到很兴奋，在这个杂乱的地方，堆满了旧床上用品、成堆的旧铁器、苍白的破旧陶器，以及许多难以想象的衣服。她和伯金不情愿地沿着生锈的商品之间的狭窄过道走下去。他看货物，她看人。

She excitedly watched a young woman, who was going to have a baby, and who was turning over a mattress and making a young man, down-at-heel and dejected, feel it also. So secretive and active and anxious the young woman seemed, so reluctant, slinking, the young man. He was going to marry her because she was having a child.
她兴奋地看着一个即将生孩子的年轻女子，翻动床垫，让一个垂头丧气的年轻男子也有同感。年轻女子显得那么神秘、活跃、焦虑，而年轻男子则显得那么不情愿、鬼鬼祟祟。他要娶她，因为她有了孩子。

When they had felt the mattress, the young woman asked the old man seated on a stool among his wares, how much it was. He told her, and she turned to the young man. The latter was ashamed, and selfconscious. He turned his face away, though he left his body standing there, and muttered aside. And again the woman anxiously and actively fingered the mattress and added up in her mind and bargained with the old, unclean man. All the while, the young man stood by, shamefaced and down-at-heel, submitting.
当他们摸到床垫后，年轻女子问坐在凳子上的老人，他的货物多少钱。他告诉了她，她转向年轻人。后者感到羞愧，自觉不自在。他转过脸去，但他的身体却站在那儿，在一旁嘀咕道。女人又焦急地、主动地用手指摸着床垫，在心里算计，与这个又老又不干净的男人讨价还价。整个过程中，年轻人羞愧地站在一旁，垂头丧气地屈服了。

‘Look,’ said Birkin, ‘there is a pretty chair.’
“看，”伯金说，“有一把漂亮的椅子。”

‘Charming!’ cried Ursula. ‘Oh, charming.’
“太迷人了！”乌苏拉喊道。 “哦，迷人。”

It was an arm-chair of simple wood, probably birch, but of such fine delicacy of grace, standing there on the sordid stones, it almost brought tears to the eyes. It was square in shape, of the purest, slender lines, and four short lines of wood in the back, that reminded Ursula of harpstrings.
那是一张简单的木头扶手椅，可能是桦木，但是却如此精致优雅，站在肮脏的石头上，几乎让人热泪盈眶。它的形状是方形的，线条最纯粹、最细长，后面有四根短木线，这让乌苏拉想起了竖琴弦。

‘It was once,’ said Birkin, ‘gilded—and it had a cane seat. Somebody has nailed this wooden seat in. Look, here is a trifle of the red that underlay the gilt. The rest is all black, except where the wood is worn pure and glossy. It is the fine unity of the lines that is so attractive. Look, how they run and meet and counteract. But of course the wooden seat is wrong—it destroys the perfect lightness and unity in tension the cane gave. I like it though—‘
“它曾经是，”伯金说，“镀金的——还有一个藤椅。有人把这个木椅钉在了上面。看，镀金下面有一点红色。其余部分全是黑色，除了木材被磨得纯净而有光泽的地方。正是线条的精细统一才如此吸引人。看看他们如何奔跑、相遇、对抗。当然，木制座椅是错误的——它破坏了手杖所带来的完美的轻盈感和张力的统一性。不过我喜欢——”

‘Ah yes,’ said Ursula, ‘so do I.’
“啊，是的，”乌苏拉说，“我也是。”

‘How much is it?’ Birkin asked the man.
“多少钱？”伯金问那人。

‘Ten shillings.’
“十先令。”

‘And you will send it—?’
“你会把它寄过来——？”

It was bought.
它被买了。

‘So beautiful, so pure!’ Birkin said. ‘It almost breaks my heart.’ They walked along between the heaps of rubbish. ‘My beloved country—it had something to express even when it made that chair.’
“如此美丽，如此纯粹！”伯金说。 “这几乎让我心碎。”他们在垃圾堆中行走。 “我心爱的国家——即使它制作了那把椅子，它也有一些东西要表达。”

‘And hasn’t it now?’ asked Ursula. She was always angry when he took this tone.
“现在不是吗？”乌苏拉问道。当他用这种语气时，她总是很生气。

‘No, it hasn’t. When I see that clear, beautiful chair, and I think of England, even Jane Austen’s England—it had living thoughts to unfold even then, and pure happiness in unfolding them. And now, we can only fish among the rubbish heaps for the remnants of their old expression. There is no production in us now, only sordid and foul mechanicalness.’
‘不，还没有。当我看到那把清晰、美丽的椅子时，我想到了英国，甚至是简·奥斯汀笔下的英国——即使在那时，它也有鲜活的思想可以展开，并且在展开它们时有纯粹的幸福。而现在，我们只能在垃圾堆中寻找他们旧日表情的残余。我们现在没有生产，只有肮脏和肮脏的机械性。

‘It isn’t true,’ cried Ursula. ‘Why must you always praise the past, at the expense of the present? REALLY, I don’t think so much of Jane Austen’s England. It was materialistic enough, if you like—‘
“这不是真的，”乌苏拉喊道。 ‘为什么你必须总是赞扬过去，而牺牲现在呢？说实话，我对简·奥斯丁笔下的英国并不太感兴趣。这已经足够物质主义了，如果你愿意的话——”

‘It could afford to be materialistic,’ said Birkin, ‘because it had the power to be something other—which we haven’t. We are materialistic because we haven’t the power to be anything else—try as we may, we can’t bring off anything but materialism: mechanism, the very soul of materialism.’
“它可以变得物质主义，”伯金说，“因为它有能力成为其他东西——而我们却没有。”我们是唯物主义的，因为我们没有能力成为其他任何东西——无论我们如何努力，我们除了唯物主义之外什么也做不到：机制，唯物主义的灵魂。

Ursula was subdued into angry silence. She did not heed what he said. She was rebelling against something else.
乌苏拉愤怒地陷入沉默。她没有理会他的话。她在反抗别的东西。

‘And I hate your past. I’m sick of it,’ she cried. ‘I believe I even hate that old chair, though it IS beautiful. It isn’t MY sort of beauty. I wish it had been smashed up when its day was over, not left to preach the beloved past to us. I’m sick of the beloved past.’
“我讨厌你的过去。我受够了，”她哭道。 “我相信我什至讨厌那把旧椅子，尽管它很漂亮。这不是我的美。我希望它在它的日子结束时被砸碎，而不是留下来向我们传播可爱的过去。我厌倦了心爱的过去。

‘Not so sick as I am of the accursed present,’ he said.
“我对这该死的礼物并没有那么厌恶，”他说。

‘Yes, just the same. I hate the present—but I don’t want the past to take its place—I don’t want that old chair.’
‘是的，就是一样。我讨厌现在——但我不想让过去取代它——我不想要那把旧椅子。

He was rather angry for a moment. Then he looked at the sky shining beyond the tower of the public baths, and he seemed to get over it all. He laughed.
一时间他颇为生气。然后他看着公共浴场塔楼外闪耀的天空，他似乎忘记了这一切。他笑了。

‘All right,’ he said, ‘then let us not have it. I’m sick of it all, too. At any rate one can’t go on living on the old bones of beauty.’
“好吧，”他说，“那就让我们不要拥有它吧。”我也厌倦了这一切。无论如何，一个人不能继续靠古老的美貌来生活。”

‘One can’t,’ she cried. ‘I DON’T want old things.’
“一个人不能，”她喊道。 “我不想要旧东西。”

‘The truth is, we don’t want things at all,’ he replied. ‘The thought of a house and furniture of my own is hateful to me.’
“事实是，我们根本不想要任何东西，”他回答道。 “一想到拥有自己的房子和家具，我就感到厌恶。”

This startled her for a moment. Then she replied:
这让她愣了一下。然后她回答说：

‘So it is to me. But one must live somewhere.’
‘对我来说也是如此。但一个人必须住在某个地方。

‘Not somewhere—anywhere,’ he said. ‘One should just live anywhere—not have a definite place. I don’t want a definite place. As soon as you get a room, and it is COMPLETE, you want to run from it. Now my rooms at the Mill are quite complete, I want them at the bottom of the sea. It is a horrible tyranny of a fixed milieu, where each piece of furniture is a commandment-stone.’
“不是某个地方——任何地方，”他说。 “一个人应该住在任何地方——而不是有一个固定的地方。我不想要一个明确的地方。一旦你得到一个房间并且它已经完成，你就会想逃离它。现在我在磨坊的房间已经很完整了，我想要它们在海底。这是固定环境的可怕暴政，每件家具都是戒律石。

She clung to his arm as they walked away from the market.
当他们离开市场时，她紧紧抓住他的手臂。

‘But what are we going to do?’ she said. ‘We must live somehow. And I do want some beauty in my surroundings. I want a sort of natural GRANDEUR even, SPLENDOUR.’
“但是我们要做什么呢？”她说。 ‘我们必须以某种方式生活。我确实想要我的周围有一些美丽的东西。我什至想要一种自然的宏伟、辉煌。

‘You’ll never get it in houses and furniture—or even clothes. Houses and furniture and clothes, they are all terms of an old base world, a detestable society of man. And if you have a Tudor house and old, beautiful furniture, it is only the past perpetuated on top of you, horrible. And if you have a perfect modern house done for you by Poiret, it is something else perpetuated on top of you. It is all horrible. It is all possessions, possessions, bullying you and turning you into a generalisation. You have to be like Rodin, Michelangelo, and leave a piece of raw rock unfinished to your figure. You must leave your surroundings sketchy, unfinished, so that you are never contained, never confined, never dominated from the outside.’
“你永远不会把它弄到房子和家具上，甚至衣服上。”房屋、家具和衣服，它们都是旧的贱民世界、可憎的人类社会的术语。如果你有一座都铎式的房子和古老而美丽的家具，那只是过去在你身上永存，太可怕了。如果你拥有波瓦雷为你打造的完美现代住宅，那么它就会成为你身上永恒的东西。这一切太可怕了。都是占有，占有，欺负你，把你变成一个概括。你必须像罗丹、米开朗基罗那样，在你的身材上留下一块未完成的岩石。你必须让你的周围环境是粗略的、未完成的，这样你就永远不会受到约束，永远不会受到限制，永远不会受到外界的支配。”

She stood in the street contemplating.
她站在街上沉思。

‘And we are never to have a complete place of our own—never a home?’ she said.
“我们永远不会拥有一个完整的自己的地方——永远不会有一个家？”她说。

‘Pray God, in this world, no,’ he answered.
“祈祷上帝，在这个世界上，不，”他回答道。

‘But there’s only this world,’ she objected.
“但只有这个世界，”她反对道。

He spread out his hands with a gesture of indifference.
他摊开双手，做出一副漠不关心的姿势。

‘Meanwhile, then, we’ll avoid having things of our own,’ he said.
“与此同时，我们将避免拥有自己的东西，”他说。

‘But you’ve just bought a chair,’ she said.
“但你刚刚买了一把椅子，”她说。

‘I can tell the man I don’t want it,’ he replied.
“我可以告诉那个人我不想要它，”他回答道。

She pondered again. Then a queer little movement twitched her face.
她又沉思了。然后，一个奇怪的小动作抽动了她的脸。

‘No,’ she said, ‘we don’t want it. I’m sick of old things.’
“不，”她说，“我们不想要它。”我厌倦了旧事物。

‘New ones as well,’ he said.
“还有新的，”他说。

They retraced their steps.
他们原路返回。

There—in front of some furniture, stood the young couple, the woman who was going to have a baby, and the narrow-faced youth. She was fair, rather short, stout. He was of medium height, attractively built. His dark hair fell sideways over his brow, from under his cap, he stood strangely aloof, like one of the damned.
那里——一些家具前，站着那对年轻夫妇，那个即将生孩子的女人，还有那个窄脸青年。她皮肤白皙，但身材矮小、粗壮。他中等身材，身材魁梧。他的黑发从额头上垂下来，从帽子下面，他站在那里，显得异常冷漠，就像一个该死的人。

‘Let us give it to THEM,’ whispered Ursula. ‘Look they are getting a home together.’
“让我们把它交给他们吧，”乌苏拉低声说。 “看他们正在一起建立一个家。”

‘I won’t aid abet them in it,’ he said petulantly, instantly sympathising with the aloof, furtive youth, against the active, procreant female.
“我不会帮助他们这样做，”他脾气暴躁地说，立即同情这个冷漠、鬼鬼祟祟的年轻人，反对活跃、生育的女性。

‘Oh yes,’ cried Ursula. ‘It’s right for them—there’s nothing else for them.’
“哦，是的，”乌苏拉喊道。 “这对他们来说是正确的——没有什么比这更适合他们了。”

‘Very well,’ said Birkin, ‘you offer it to them. I’ll watch.’
“很好，”伯金说，“你把它提供给他们。”我会看的。

Ursula went rather nervously to the young couple, who were discussing an iron washstand—or rather, the man was glancing furtively and wonderingly, like a prisoner, at the abominable article, whilst the woman was arguing.
乌苏拉相当紧张地走向那对年轻夫妇，他们正在讨论一个铁盥洗台——或者更确切地说，当女人在争论时，男人像囚犯一样偷偷地、疑惑地看着那件令人厌恶的物品。

‘We bought a chair,’ said Ursula, ‘and we don’t want it. Would you have it? We should be glad if you would.’
“我们买了一把椅子，”乌苏拉说，“但我们不想要它。你愿意吗？如果你愿意的话，我们会很高兴。

The young couple looked round at her, not believing that she could be addressing them.
这对年轻夫妇回头看着她，不相信她能对他们说话。

‘Would you care for it?’ repeated Ursula. ‘It’s really VERY pretty—but—but—‘ she smiled rather dazzlingly.
“你会关心它吗？”乌苏拉重复道。 “真的非常漂亮——但是——但是——”她笑得相当耀眼。

The young couple only stared at her, and looked significantly at each other, to know what to do. And the man curiously obliterated himself, as if he could make himself invisible, as a rat can.
小两口只是盯着她，意味深长地对视一眼，不知道该怎么办。而那个男人奇怪地抹掉了自己，仿佛他可以让自己隐形，就像老鼠一样。

‘We wanted to GIVE it to you,’ explained Ursula, now overcome with confusion and dread of them. She was attracted by the young man. He was a still, mindless creature, hardly a man at all, a creature that the towns have produced, strangely pure-bred and fine in one sense, furtive, quick, subtle. His lashes were dark and long and fine over his eyes, that had no mind in them, only a dreadful kind of subject, inward consciousness, glazed and dark. His dark brows and all his lines, were finely drawn. He would be a dreadful, but wonderful lover to a woman, so marvellously contributed. His legs would be marvellously subtle and alive, under the shapeless, trousers, he had some of the fineness and stillness and silkiness of a dark-eyed, silent rat.
“我们想把它给你，”乌苏拉解释道，她现在被他们的困惑和恐惧所克服。她被这个年轻人吸引了。他是一个安静的、没有头脑的生物，根本算不上一个人，是城镇中产生的一个生物，奇怪的是，他的血统纯正，从某种意义上来说很优秀，鬼祟、敏捷、狡猾。他的睫毛又黑又长，眼睛上方很细，眼睛里没有思想，只有一种可怕的主体，内在的意识，呆滞而黑暗。他的乌黑眉毛，所有的线条，都画得很精致。对于一个女人来说，他会是一个可怕但又美妙的情人，做出了惊人的贡献。他的双腿异常纤细而有活力，在无形的裤子下，他有一种黑眼睛、沉默的老鼠的精致、平静和丝滑。

Ursula had apprehended him with a fine FRISSON of attraction. The full-built woman was staring offensively. Again Ursula forgot him.
乌苏拉带着一种强烈的吸引力抓住了他。身材魁梧的女人目光充满攻击性。乌苏拉又忘记了他。

‘Won’t you have the chair?’ she said.
“你不想要椅子吗？”她说。

The man looked at her with a sideways look of appreciation, yet faroff, almost insolent. The woman drew herself up. There was a certain costermonger richness about her. She did not know what Ursula was after, she was on her guard, hostile. Birkin approached, smiling wickedly at seeing Ursula so nonplussed and frightened.
男人斜眼看着她，眼神充满欣赏，却又疏远，近乎傲慢。女人挺直了身子。她身上有一种小贩的丰富气质。她不知道乌苏拉在追求什么，她保持警惕，充满敌意。伯金走近，看到乌苏拉如此困惑和害怕，邪恶地微笑着。

‘What’s the matter?’ he said, smiling. His eyelids had dropped slightly, there was about him the same suggestive, mocking secrecy that was in the bearing of the two city creatures. The man jerked his head a little on one side, indicating Ursula, and said, with curious amiable, jeering warmth:
“怎么了？”他微笑着说道。他的眼皮微微垂下，身上带着和这两个城市生物一样的暗示性、嘲弄性的神秘感。那人把头稍稍偏向一边，指着乌苏拉，带着好奇的和蔼可亲、嘲讽的热情说道：

‘What she warnt?—eh?’ An odd smile writhed his lips.
“她警告什么？——呃？”他的嘴角露出一丝奇怪的微笑。

Birkin looked at him from under his slack, ironical eyelids.
伯金从他松弛、讽刺的眼皮下看着他。

‘To give you a chair—that—with the label on it,’ he said, pointing.
“给你一把椅子——那个——上面有标签，”他指着说道。

The man looked at the object indicated. There was a curious hostility in male, outlawed understanding between the two men.
男子看着指示的物体。两个人之间存在着一种奇怪的敌意，一种不合法的理解。

‘What’s she warnt to give it US for, guvnor,’ he replied, in a tone of free intimacy that insulted Ursula.
“她为什么要给美国呢，州长，”他回答道，语气中自由而亲密的语气侮辱了乌苏拉。

‘Thought you’d like it—it’s a pretty chair. We bought it and don’t want it. No need for you to have it, don’t be frightened,’ said Birkin, with a wry smile.
“我以为你会喜欢它——这是一把漂亮的椅子。我们买了它但不想要它。你不需要拥有它，别害怕。”伯金苦笑着说道。

The man glanced up at him, half inimical, half recognising.
男人抬头看了他一眼，半是敌意，半是认出。

‘Why don’t you want it for yourselves, if you’ve just bought it?’ asked the woman coolly. ‘’Taint good enough for you, now you’ve had a look at it. Frightened it’s got something in it, eh?’
“既然是刚买的，为什么不自己想要呢？”女人冷冷地问道。 “污点对你来说已经足够好了，现在你已经看过了。害怕里面有东西，嗯？

She was looking at Ursula, admiringly, but with some resentment.
她看着乌苏拉，目光充满钦佩，但又带着一丝怨恨。

‘I’d never thought of that,’ said Birkin. ‘But no, the wood’s too thin everywhere.’
“我从没想过这一点，”伯金说。 “但是不，到处都是木头太薄了。”

‘You see,’ said Ursula, her face luminous and pleased. ‘WE are just going to get married, and we thought we’d buy things. Then we decided, just now, that we wouldn’t have furniture, we’d go abroad.’
“你看，”乌苏拉说道，她的脸容光焕发，很高兴。 “我们正要结婚，我们想买点东西。然后我们就决定，我们不会有家具，我们会出国。”

The full-built, slightly blowsy city girl looked at the fine face of the other woman, with appreciation. They appreciated each other. The youth stood aside, his face expressionless and timeless, the thin line of the black moustache drawn strangely suggestive over his rather wide, closed mouth. He was impassive, abstract, like some dark suggestive presence, a gutter-presence.
身材魁梧，略显丰腴的城里女孩，满脸欣赏地看着另一个女人精致的脸庞。他们互相欣赏。年轻人站在一旁，面无表情，永恒不变，黑色胡须的细线在他那张紧闭的宽嘴上画出奇怪的暗示。他冷漠、抽象，就像某种黑暗的、暗示性的存在，一种阴沟的存在。

‘It’s all right to be some folks,’ said the city girl, turning to her own young man. He did not look at her, but he smiled with the lower part of his face, putting his head aside in an odd gesture of assent. His eyes were unchanging, glazed with darkness.
“做个普通人没什么问题，”城里女孩转向自己的年轻人说道。他没有看她，但下半张脸笑了笑，把头偏到一边，做出了一个奇怪的表示同意的姿势。他的眼睛没有任何变化，充满了黑暗。

‘Cawsts something to change your mind,’ he said, in an incredibly low accent.
“需要一些东西来改变你的想法，”他用极其低沉的口音说道。

‘Only ten shillings this time,’ said Birkin.
“这次只要十先令，”伯金说。

The man looked up at him with a grimace of a smile, furtive, unsure.
男人抬头看着他，脸上挂着一抹诡异的笑，带着一丝不确定。

‘Cheap at ‘arf a quid, guvnor,’ he said. ‘Not like getting divawced.’
“便宜一英镑，长官，”他说。 “不像离婚。”

‘We’re not married yet,’ said Birkin.
“我们还没有结婚，”伯金说。

‘No, no more aren’t we,’ said the young woman loudly. ‘But we shall be, a Saturday.’
“不，我们不再这样了，”年轻女子大声说道。 “但我们应该是星期六。”

Again she looked at the young man with a determined, protective look, at once overbearing and very gentle. He grinned sicklily, turning away his head. She had got his manhood, but Lord, what did he care! He had a strange furtive pride and slinking singleness.
她再次用坚定、保护的眼神看着这个年轻人，眼神既霸道又温柔。他病态地笑了笑，转过头去。她已经得到了他的男子气概，但是主啊，他在乎什么呢！他有一种奇怪的、偷偷摸摸的骄傲和偷偷摸摸的单身。

‘Good luck to you,’ said Birkin.
“祝你好运，”伯金说。

‘Same to you,’ said the young woman. Then, rather tentatively: ‘When’s yours coming off, then?’
“你也一样，”年轻女子说。然后，试探性地问：“那你的什么时候下架？”

Birkin looked round at Ursula.
伯金回头看着乌苏拉。

‘It’s for the lady to say,’ he replied. ‘We go to the registrar the moment she’s ready.’
“这是那位女士说的，”他回答道。 “她一准备好，我们就去找登记员。”

Ursula laughed, covered with confusion and bewilderment.
乌苏拉笑了，脸上充满了困惑和困惑。

‘No ‘urry,’ said the young man, grinning suggestive.
“不用了，”年轻人微笑着暗示道。

‘Oh, don’t break your neck to get there,’ said the young woman. ‘’Slike when you’re dead—you’re long time married.’
“哦，别为了到达那里而折断你的脖子，”年轻女子说道。 “就像你死后一样——你已经结婚很久了。”

The young man turned aside as if this hit him.
年轻人仿佛受到了打击，转过身去。

‘The longer the better, let us hope,’ said Birkin.
“让我们希望，越长越好，”伯金说。

‘That’s it, guvnor,’ said the young man admiringly. ‘Enjoy it while it larsts—niver whip a dead donkey.’
“就是这样，州长，”年轻人钦佩地说。 “在它持续的时候享受它——永远不要鞭打一头死驴。”

‘Only when he’s shamming dead,’ said the young woman, looking at her young man with caressive tenderness of authority.
“只有当他装死的时候，”年轻女子说道，用权威的爱抚和温柔看着她的年轻人。

‘Aw, there’s a difference,’ he said satirically.
“哦，有区别，”他讽刺地说。

‘What about the chair?’ said Birkin.
“那把椅子呢？”伯金问道。

‘Yes, all right,’ said the woman.
“是的，好吧，”女人说。

They trailed off to the dealer, the handsome but abject young fellow hanging a little aside.
他们渐渐走向经销商，那个英俊但卑微的年轻人挂在一边。

‘That’s it,’ said Birkin. ‘Will you take it with you, or have the address altered.’
“就是这样，”伯金说。 “你能把它带走吗，还是改一下地址。”

‘Oh, Fred can carry it. Make him do what he can for the dear old ‘ome.’
“哦，弗雷德可以扛着它。”让他为亲爱的老“ome”尽其所能。

‘Mike use of’im,’ said Fred, grimly humorous, as he took the chair from the dealer. His movements were graceful, yet curiously abject, slinking.
“迈克利用了他，”弗雷德一边从经销商手中接过椅子，一边幽默地说。他的动作很优雅，但奇怪的是，他的卑鄙、偷偷摸摸的。

‘’Ere’s mother’s cosy chair,’ he said. ‘Warnts a cushion.’ And he stood it down on the market stones.
“这是妈妈舒适的椅子，”他说。 “需要一个垫子。”他把它放在市场上的石头上。

‘Don’t you think it’s pretty?’ laughed Ursula.
“你不觉得它很漂亮吗？”乌苏拉笑道。

‘Oh, I do,’ said the young woman.
“哦，我愿意，”年轻女子说。

‘’Ave a sit in it, you’ll wish you’d kept it,’ said the young man.
“坐进去看看，你会希望自己保留了它，”年轻人说。

Ursula promptly sat down in the middle of the market-place.
乌苏拉立即在市场中央坐下。

‘Awfully comfortable,’ she said. ‘But rather hard. You try it.’ She invited the young man to a seat. But he turned uncouthly, awkwardly aside, glancing up at her with quick bright eyes, oddly suggestive, like a quick, live rat.
“非常舒服，”她说。 ‘但是相当困难。你试试吧。”她邀请年轻人坐下。但他却粗鲁地、笨拙地转过身来，用明亮的眼睛快速地抬头看了她一眼，带着奇怪的暗示，就像一只敏捷的活老鼠。

‘Don’t spoil him,’ said the young woman. ‘He’s not used to arm-chairs, ‘e isn’t.
“别宠坏他，”年轻女子说道。 “他不习惯扶手椅，”他不习惯。

The young man turned away, and said, with averted grin:
青年转过身去，笑道：

‘Only warnts legs on ‘is.’
“仅在‘是’上警告腿。”

The four parted. The young woman thanked them.
四个人分手了。年轻女子向他们表示感谢。

‘Thank you for the chair—it’ll last till it gives way.’
“谢谢你送来的椅子——它会一直持续到垮掉为止。”

‘Keep it for an ornyment,’ said the young man.
“留着当饰品吧，”年轻人说。

‘Good afternoon—Good afternoon,’ said Ursula and Birkin.
“下午好——下午好，”乌苏拉和伯金说。

‘Goo’-luck to you,’ said the young man, glancing and avoiding Birkin’s eyes, as he turned aside his head.
“祝你好运。”年轻人一边说着，一边扭过头去，避开了伯金的目光。

The two couples went asunder, Ursula clinging to Birkin’s arm. When they had gone some distance, she glanced back and saw the young man going beside the full, easy young woman. His trousers sank over his heels, he moved with a sort of slinking evasion, more crushed with odd self-consciousness now he had the slim old arm-chair to carry, his arm over the back, the four fine, square tapering legs swaying perilously near the granite setts of the pavement. And yet he was somewhere indomitable and separate, like a quick, vital rat. He had a queer, subterranean beauty, repulsive too.
两对情侣分开了，乌苏拉紧紧抓住伯金的手臂。走了一段距离，她回头一看，看到年轻人走在丰满、从容的年轻女子身边。他的裤子沉到了脚后跟上，他以一种偷偷摸摸的躲避方式移动，现在他带着那把细长的旧扶手椅，他的手臂放在靠背上，四根细长的方形锥形腿危险地摇晃着，奇怪的自我意识更加压垮了他。靠近人行道的花岗岩设置。然而他却顽强而独立，就像一只敏捷而充满活力的老鼠。他有一种奇怪的、神秘的美，但也令人厌恶。

‘How strange they are!’ said Ursula.
“他们真奇怪！”乌苏拉说。

‘Children of men,’ he said. ‘They remind me of Jesus: ‘The meek shall inherit the earth.‘‘
“人类之子，”他说。 “它们让我想起耶稣：‘温顺的人将继承大地。’”

‘But they aren’t the meek,’ said Ursula.
“但他们并不温顺，”乌苏拉说。

‘Yes, I don’t know why, but they are,’ he replied.
“是的，我不知道为什么，但确实如此，”他回答道。

They waited for the tramcar. Ursula sat on top and looked out on the town. The dusk was just dimming the hollows of crowded houses.
他们等待电车。乌苏拉坐在上面，眺望着小镇。黄昏刚刚使拥挤的房屋空洞变暗。

‘And are they going to inherit the earth?’ she said.
“他们会继承地球吗？”她说。

‘Yes—they.’
“是的——他们。”

‘Then what are we going to do?’ she asked. ‘We’re not like them—are we? We’re not the meek?’
“那我们该怎么办？”她问道。 ‘我们不像他们——是吗？我们不是温顺的人吗？

‘No. We’ve got to live in the chinks they leave us.’
'不。我们必须生活在他们留给我们的缝隙里。

‘How horrible!’ cried Ursula. ‘I don’t want to live in chinks.’
“太可怕了！”乌苏拉喊道。 “我不想生活在狭缝中。”

‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘They are the children of men, they like market-places and street-corners best. That leaves plenty of chinks.’
“别担心，”他说。 “他们是人类的孩子，他们最喜欢市场和街角。这留下了很多缝隙。

‘All the world,’ she said.
“全世界，”她说。

‘Ah no—but some room.’
“啊不——但是要有一些空间。”

The tramcar mounted slowly up the hill, where the ugly winter-grey masses of houses looked like a vision of hell that is cold and angular. They sat and looked. Away in the distance was an angry redness of sunset. It was all cold, somehow small, crowded, and like the end of the world.
电车缓缓向山上爬去，山上一排排丑陋的冬灰色房屋，冰冷而棱角分明，就像地狱的景象。他们坐下来看着。远处是愤怒的红色夕阳。天气很冷，又小又拥挤，就像世界末日一样。

‘I don’t mind it even then,’ said Ursula, looking at the repulsiveness of it all. ‘It doesn’t concern me.’
“即便如此，我也不介意。”乌苏拉看着这令人厌恶的一切说道。 “这与我无关。”

‘No more it does,’ he replied, holding her hand. ‘One needn’t see. One goes one’s way. In my world it is sunny and spacious—‘
“不再这样了，”他回答道，握着她的手。 ‘人们不必看到。一个人走自己的路。我的世界里阳光明媚、宽敞——’

‘It is, my love, isn’t it?’ she cried, hugging near to him on the top of the tramcar, so that the other passengers stared at them.
“是的，亲爱的，不是吗？”她喊道，在电车顶上紧紧地拥抱着他，其他乘客都盯着他们看。

‘And we will wander about on the face of the earth,’ he said, ‘and we’ll look at the world beyond just this bit.’
“我们将在地球表面漫步，”他说，“我们将看到超越这一点的世界。”

There was a long silence. Her face was radiant like gold, as she sat thinking.
一阵长时间的沉默。当她坐着思考时，她的脸容光焕发，像金子一样。

‘I don’t want to inherit the earth,’ she said. ‘I don’t want to inherit anything.’
“我不想继承地球，”她说。 “我不想继承任何东西。”

He closed his hand over hers.
他把手放在她的手上。

‘Neither do I. I want to be disinherited.’
“我也不想。我想被剥夺继承权。”

She clasped his fingers closely.
她紧紧握住他的手指。

‘We won’t care about ANYTHING,’ she said.
“我们不会关心任何事情，”她说。

He sat still, and laughed.
他静静地坐着，笑了。

‘And we’ll be married, and have done with them,’ she added.
“我们会结婚，和他们结束了，”她补充道。

Again he laughed.
他又笑了。

‘It’s one way of getting rid of everything,’ she said, ‘to get married.’
“这是摆脱一切的一种方式，”她说，“结婚。”

‘And one way of accepting the whole world,’ he added.
“这是接受整个世界的一种方式，”他补充道。

‘A whole other world, yes,’ she said happily.
“是的，这是一个完全不同的世界，”她高兴地说。

‘Perhaps there’s Gerald—and Gudrun—‘ he said.
“也许还有杰拉德——和古德伦——”他说。

‘If there is there is, you see,’ she said. ‘It’s no good our worrying. We can’t really alter them, can we?’
“如果有的话，你瞧，”她说。 ‘我们担心是没有用的。我们真的无法改变它们，不是吗？

‘No,’ he said. ‘One has no right to try—not with the best intentions in the world.’
“不，”他说。 “一个人没有权利去尝试——除非是出于世界上最好的意图。”

‘Do you try to force them?’ she asked.
“你想强迫他们吗？”她问道。

‘Perhaps,’ he said. ‘Why should I want him to be free, if it isn’t his business?’
“也许吧，”他说。 “如果这不关他的事，我为什么要让他自由呢？”

She paused for a time.
她停顿了一下。

‘We can’t MAKE him happy, anyhow,’ she said. ‘He’d have to be it of himself.’
“无论如何，我们不能让他高兴，”她说。 “他必须是他自己。”

‘I know,’ he said. ‘But we want other people with us, don’t we?’
“我知道，”他说。 “但我们希望其他人和我们在一起，不是吗？”

‘Why should we?’ she asked.
“我们为什么要这么做？”她问道。

‘I don’t know,’ he said uneasily. ‘One has a hankering after a sort of further fellowship.’
“我不知道，”他不安地说。 “人们渴望进一步的友谊。”

‘But why?’ she insisted. ‘Why should you hanker after other people? Why should you need them?’
“但是为什么呢？”她坚持道。 ‘你为什么要贪恋别人？为什么你需要它们？

This hit him right on the quick. His brows knitted.
这对他来说是一个打击。他的眉头皱了起来。

‘Does it end with just our two selves?’ he asked, tense.
“最后只剩下我们两个了吗？”他紧张地问道。

‘Yes—what more do you want? If anybody likes to come along, let them. But why must you run after them?’
‘是的——你还想要什么？如果有人愿意一起来，就让他们来吧。但为什么你一定要追他们呢？

His face was tense and unsatisfied.
他的脸色紧张而不满。

‘You see,’ he said, ‘I always imagine our being really happy with some few other people—a little freedom with people.’
“你看，”他说，“我总是想象我们和其他几个人在一起真的很快乐——与人相处有一点自由。”

She pondered for a moment.
她沉思了一会儿。

‘Yes, one does want that. But it must HAPPEN. You can’t do anything for it with your will. You always seem to think you can FORCE the flowers to come out. People must love us because they love us—you can’t MAKE them.’
‘是的，人们确实想要这样。但这一定会发生。你无法凭自己的意志为它做任何事。你似乎总是认为你可以强迫花朵绽放。人们必须爱我们，因为他们爱我们——你无法创造他们。

‘I know,’ he said. ‘But must one take no steps at all? Must one just go as if one were alone in the world—the only creature in the world?’
“我知道，”他说。 “但是我们必须不采取任何措施吗？难道一个人必须像世界上孤独的人一样——世界上唯一的生物吗？

‘You’ve got me,’ she said. ‘Why should you NEED others? Why must you force people to agree with you? Why can’t you be single by yourself, as you are always saying? You try to bully Gerald—as you tried to bully Hermione. You must learn to be alone. And it’s so horrid of you. You’ve got me. And yet you want to force other people to love you as well. You do try to bully them to love you. And even then, you don’t want their love.’
“你有我，”她说。 ‘你为什么需要别人？为什么一定要强迫别人同意你的观点？为什么你不能像你常说的那样，自己单身呢？你试图欺负杰拉德——就像你试图欺负赫敏一样。你必须学会​​独处。你真是太可怕了。你有我。然而你却想强迫别人也爱你。你确实试图欺负他们来爱你。即使那样，你也不想要他们的爱。

His face was full of real perplexity.
他的脸上写满了真正的困惑。

‘Don’t I?’ he said. ‘It’s the problem I can’t solve. I KNOW I want a perfect and complete relationship with you: and we’ve nearly got it—we really have. But beyond that. DO I want a real, ultimate relationship with Gerald? Do I want a final, almost extra-human relationship with him—a relationship in the ultimate of me and him—or don’t I?’
“我不是吗？”他说。 ‘这是我无法解决的问题。我知道我想要与你建立完美而完整的关系：我们几乎已经实现了——我们真的做到了。但除此之外。我想与杰拉德建立真正的、最终的关系吗？我是否想要与他建立一种最终的、几乎超人类的关系——一种我和他的终极关系——或者我不想吗？

She looked at him for a long time, with strange bright eyes, but she did not answer.
她看着他良久，眼睛里异样的明亮，却没有回答。

CHAPTER XXVII
第二十七章

FLITTING
飞掠

That evening Ursula returned home very bright-eyed and wondrous—which irritated her people. Her father came home at suppertime, tired after the evening class, and the long journey home. Gudrun was reading, the mother sat in silence.
那天晚上，乌苏拉回到家，眼睛明亮，神采奕奕，这激怒了她的家人。她的父亲在晚饭时间回到家，上完晚课和长途跋涉回家后，他感到很累。古珍正在读书，母亲默默地坐着。

Suddenly Ursula said to the company at large, in a bright voice, ‘Rupert and I are going to be married tomorrow.’
突然，乌苏拉用明亮的声音对整个公司说道：“鲁珀特和我明天就要结婚了。”

Her father turned round, stiffly.
她父亲转过身来，表情僵硬。

‘You what?’ he said.
“你什么？”他说。

‘Tomorrow!’ echoed Gudrun.
“明天！”古德伦附和道。

‘Indeed!’ said the mother.
“确实如此！”母亲说。

But Ursula only smiled wonderfully, and did not reply.
但乌苏拉只是灿烂一笑，并没有回答。

‘Married tomorrow!’ cried her father harshly. ‘What are you talking about.’
“明天结婚！”她父亲严厉地喊道。 '你在说什么。'

‘Yes,’ said Ursula. ‘Why not?’ Those two words, from her, always drove him mad. ‘Everything is all right—we shall go to the registrar’s office-’
“是的，”乌苏拉说。 “为什么不呢？”她的这两个字总是让他发疯。 “一切都好——我们去登记办公室——”

There was a second’s hush in the room, after Ursula’s blithe vagueness.
乌苏拉愉快地含糊其辞之后，房间里陷入了短暂的寂静。

‘REALLY, Ursula!’ said Gudrun.
“真的，乌苏拉！”古德伦说。

‘Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy?’ demanded the mother, rather superbly.
“我们可以问一下，为什么要这么保密吗？”母亲相当高调地问道。

‘But there hasn’t,’ said Ursula. ‘You knew.’
“但还没有，”乌苏拉说。 '你知道。'

‘Who knew?’ now cried the father. ‘Who knew? What do you mean by your ‘you knew’?’
“谁知道呢？”父亲大声喊道。 '谁知道？你说的‘你知道’是什么意思？

He was in one of his stupid rages, she instantly closed against him.
他正处于一种愚蠢的愤怒之中，她立即对他关闭了。

‘Of course you knew,’ she said coolly. ‘You knew we were going to get married.’
“你当然知道，”她冷冷地说。 “你知道我们要结婚了。”

There was a dangerous pause.
有一个危险的停顿。

‘We knew you were going to get married, did we? Knew! Why, does anybody know anything about you, you shifty bitch!’
“我们知道你要结婚，是吗？知道！哎呀，有人了解你吗，你这个狡猾的婊子！

‘Father!’ cried Gudrun, flushing deep in violent remonstrance. Then, in a cold, but gentle voice, as if to remind her sister to be tractable: ‘But isn’t it a FEARFULLY sudden decision, Ursula?’ she asked.
“父亲！”古德伦喊道，他的脸因强烈的抗议而涨得通红。然后，她用冷漠但温柔的声音问道，仿佛是在提醒姐姐要听话：“但这不是一个非常突然的决定吗，乌苏拉？”她问道。

‘No, not really,’ replied Ursula, with the same maddening cheerfulness. ‘He’s been WANTING me to agree for weeks—he’s had the licence ready. Only I—I wasn’t ready in myself. Now I am ready—is there anything to be disagreeable about?’
“不，不是真的，”乌苏拉回答道，带着同样令人发狂的快乐。 “他几周来一直希望我同意——他已经准备好了许可证。只有我——我自己还没有准备好。现在我准备好了——还有什么不愉快的吗？

‘Certainly not,’ said Gudrun, but in a tone of cold reproof. ‘You are perfectly free to do as you like.’
“当然不是，”古德伦说道，语气中带着冷酷的责备。 “你完全可以自由地做你想做的事。”

‘’Ready in yourself’—YOURSELF, that’s all that matters, isn’t it! ‘I wasn’t ready in myself,‘‘ he mimicked her phrase offensively. ‘You and YOURSELF, you’re of some importance, aren’t you?’
“你自己做好准备”——你自己，这才是最重要的，不是吗！ “我自己还没准备好，”他冒犯性地模仿着她的话。 “你和你自己，都很重要，不是吗？”

She drew herself up and set back her throat, her eyes shining yellow and dangerous.
她挺直身子，收起喉咙，黄眼睛闪烁着危险的光芒。

‘I am to myself,’ she said, wounded and mortified. ‘I know I am not to anybody else. You only wanted to BULLY me—you never cared for my happiness.’
“我对我自己来说，”她说，既受伤又羞愧。 ‘我知道我不属于任何人。你只想欺负我——你从来不关心我的幸福。

He was leaning forward watching her, his face intense like a spark.
他倾身向前看着她，他的脸像火花一样紧张。

‘Ursula, what are you saying? Keep your tongue still,’ cried her mother.
‘乌苏拉，你在说什么？保持你的舌头不动，”她的母亲喊道。

Ursula swung round, and the lights in her eyes flashed.
乌苏拉转过身来，眼中闪烁着光芒。

‘No, I won’t,’ she cried. ‘I won’t hold my tongue and be bullied. What does it matter which day I get married—what does it MATTER! It doesn’t affect anybody but myself.’
“不，我不会，”她哭道。 “我不会闭嘴而被欺负。我哪一天结婚有什么关系——这有什么关系！除了我自己之外，它不会影响任何人。

Her father was tense and gathered together like a cat about to spring.
她的父亲紧张极了，像一只即将扑腾的猫一样聚集在一起。

‘Doesn’t it?’ he cried, coming nearer to her. She shrank away.
“不是吗？”他喊道，走近她。她退缩了。

‘No, how can it?’ she replied, shrinking but stubborn.
“不，怎么可能呢？”她回答道，畏缩但固执。

‘It doesn’t matter to ME then, what you do—what becomes of you?’ he cried, in a strange voice like a cry.
“那么，你做什么——你会变成什么样子，对我来说都不重要了？”他喊道，声音怪怪的，就像哭泣一样。

The mother and Gudrun stood back as if hypnotised.
母亲和古德伦向后退了一步，仿佛被催眠了一样。

‘No,’ stammered Ursula. Her father was very near to her. ‘You only want to-’
“不，”乌苏拉结结巴巴地说。她的父亲离她很近。 “你只想——”

She knew it was dangerous, and she stopped. He was gathered together, every muscle ready.
她知道这很危险，所以她停了下来。他聚集在一起，每一块肌肉都准备好了。

‘What?’ he challenged.
“什么？”他问道。

‘Bully me,’ she muttered, and even as her lips were moving, his hand had caught her smack at the side of the face and she was sent up against the door.
“欺负我。”她嘟囔着，就在她的嘴唇动着的时候，他的手就打在了她的脸颊上，她被推到了门边。

‘Father!’ cried Gudrun in a high voice, ‘it is impossible!’
“父亲！”古德伦高声喊道，“这不可能！”

He stood unmoving. Ursula recovered, her hand was on the door handle. She slowly drew herself up. He seemed doubtful now.
他站着一动不动。乌苏拉回过神来，她的手放在门把手上。她慢慢地直起身子。他现在似乎有些怀疑了。

‘It’s true,’ she declared, with brilliant tears in her eyes, her head lifted up in defiance. ‘What has your love meant, what did it ever mean?—bullying, and denial-it did-’
“这是真的，”她宣称，眼里含着晶莹的泪水，挑衅地抬起头。 “你的爱意味着什么，它曾经意味着什么？——欺凌和否认——它确实——”

He was advancing again with strange, tense movements, and clenched fist, and the face of a murderer. But swift as lightning she had flashed out of the door, and they heard her running upstairs.
他再次前进，动作怪异而紧张，拳头紧握，脸上一副杀人犯的表情。但她闪电般地冲出了门，他们听到她跑上楼的声音。

He stood for a moment looking at the door. Then, like a defeated animal, he turned and went back to his seat by the fire.
他站了一会儿，看着门口。然后，他像一只被打败的动物一样，转身回到了火边的座位上。

Gudrun was very white. Out of the intense silence, the mother’s voice was heard saying, cold and angry:
古德伦很白。一片寂静中，传来母亲冰冷而愤怒的声音：

‘Well, you shouldn’t take so much notice of her.’
“好吧，你不应该太在意她。”

Again the silence fell, each followed a separate set of emotions and thoughts.
沉默再次降临，每个人都有不同的情感和想法。

Suddenly the door opened again: Ursula, dressed in hat and furs, with a small valise in her hand:
突然，门又开了：乌苏拉，戴着帽子，穿着毛皮衣服，手里提着一个小提箱：

‘Good-bye!’ she said, in her maddening, bright, almost mocking tone. ‘I’m going.’
“再见！”她用令人抓狂、明亮、近乎嘲讽的语气说道。 '我要去。'

And in the next instant the door was closed, they heard the outer door, then her quick steps down the garden path, then the gate banged, and her light footfall was gone. There was a silence like death in the house.
下一瞬间，门关上了，他们听到外门的声音，然后她沿着花园小路快步走下去，然后大门砰地一声关上，她轻盈的脚步声消失了。屋子里一片死一般的寂静。

Ursula went straight to the station, hastening heedlessly on winged feet. There was no train, she must walk on to the junction. As she went through the darkness, she began to cry, and she wept bitterly, with a dumb, heart-broken, child’s anguish, all the way on the road, and in the train. Time passed unheeded and unknown, she did not know where she was, nor what was taking place. Only she wept from fathomless depths of hopeless, hopeless grief, the terrible grief of a child, that knows no extenuation.
乌苏拉直奔车站，迈着翅膀漫不经心地赶路。没有火车，她必须步行到路口。当她穿过黑暗时，她开始哭泣，一路上、在火车上，她哭得很伤心，带着一种无声的、心碎的、孩子般的痛苦。时间在不知不觉中流逝，她不知道自己在哪里，也不知道发生了什么。只有她从深不可测的绝望、绝望的悲伤中哭泣，这是一个孩子的可怕悲伤，无可原谅。

Yet her voice had the same defensive brightness as she spoke to Birkin’s landlady at the door.
然而，当她在门口对伯金的女房东说话时，她的声音充满了防御性的明亮。

‘Good evening! Is Mr Birkin in? Can I see him?’
'晚上好！伯金先生在吗？我可以见他吗？

‘Yes, he’s in. He’s in his study.’
“是的，他在。他在书房里。”

Ursula slipped past the woman. His door opened. He had heard her voice.
乌苏拉从那个女人身边溜过去。他的门打开了。他听到了她的声音。

‘Hello!’ he exclaimed in surprise, seeing her standing there with the valise in her hand, and marks of tears on her face. She was one who wept without showing many traces, like a child.
“你好！”他惊讶地喊道，看到她站在那里，手里提着提包，脸上挂着泪痕。她是一个哭得不露痕迹的人，就像一个孩子。

‘Do I look a sight?’ she said, shrinking.
“我看上去很丑吗？”她畏缩着说道。

‘No—why? Come in,’ he took the bag from her hand and they went into the study.
'没有为什么？进来吧。”他从她手里接过包，然后走进了书房。

There—immediately, her lips began to tremble like those of a child that remembers again, and the tears came rushing up.
那里——立刻，她的嘴唇就开始像恢复记忆的孩子一样颤抖，泪水夺眶而出。

‘What’s the matter?’ he asked, taking her in his arms. She sobbed violently on his shoulder, whilst he held her still, waiting.
“怎么了？”他将她抱在怀里问道。她靠在他肩上剧烈地哭泣，而他则抱着她一动不动，等待着。

‘What’s the matter?’ he said again, when she was quieter. But she only pressed her face further into his shoulder, in pain, like a child that cannot tell.
“怎么了？”等她安静下来后，他又问道。但她只是把脸进一步贴在他的肩膀上，痛苦得像个无法诉说的孩子。

‘What is it, then?’ he asked. Suddenly she broke away, wiped her eyes, regained her composure, and went and sat in a chair.
“那是什么？”他问道。突然，她挣脱开来，擦了擦眼睛，恢复了平静，走到椅子上坐下。

‘Father hit me,’ she announced, sitting bunched up, rather like a ruffled bird, her eyes very bright.
“父亲打了我，”她宣布，坐成一团，就像一只皱起的小鸟，她的眼睛非常明亮。

‘What for?’ he said.
“为什么？”他说。

She looked away, and would not answer. There was a pitiful redness about her sensitive nostrils, and her quivering lips.
她移开视线，没有回答。她敏感的鼻孔泛着可怜的红，嘴唇颤抖着。

‘Why?’ he repeated, in his strange, soft, penetrating voice.
“为什么？”他用奇怪、柔和、具有穿透力的声音重复道。

She looked round at him, rather defiantly.
她转头看着他，语气颇为挑衅。

‘Because I said I was going to be married tomorrow, and he bullied me.’
“因为我说我明天要结婚，他就欺负我了。”

‘Why did he bully you?’
“他为什么欺负你？”

Her mouth dropped again, she remembered the scene once more, the tears came up.
她的嘴角又垂了下来，她再次想起当时的情景，泪水夺眶而出。

‘Because I said he didn’t care—and he doesn’t, it’s only his domineeringness that’s hurt—‘ she said, her mouth pulled awry by her weeping, all the time she spoke, so that he almost smiled, it seemed so childish. Yet it was not childish, it was a mortal conflict, a deep wound.
“因为我说他不在乎——他也不在乎，受伤的只是他的霸道——”她说，她的嘴因哭泣而歪曲，她说话的时候，他几乎笑了，看起来幼稚。但这并不幼稚，这是一场致命的冲突，一个深深的伤口。

‘It isn’t quite true,’ he said. ‘And even so, you shouldn’t SAY it.’
“这并不完全正确，”他说。 “即便如此，你也不应该说出来。”

‘It IS true—it IS true,’ she wept, ‘and I won’t be bullied by his pretending it’s love—when it ISN’T—he doesn’t care, how can he—no, he can’t-’
“这是真的——这是真的，”她哭泣着，“我不会被他假装这是爱所欺负——其实这不是爱——他不在乎，他怎么能——不，他不能—— '

He sat in silence. She moved him beyond himself.
他静静地坐着。她让他超越了自己。

‘Then you shouldn’t rouse him, if he can’t,’ replied Birkin quietly.
“那么你就不应该叫醒他，如果他不能的话，”伯金平静地回答道。

‘And I HAVE loved him, I have,’ she wept. ‘I’ve loved him always, and he’s always done this to me, he has—‘
“我爱过他，我爱过，”她哭着说。 “我一直爱他，他总是这样对我，他——”

‘It’s been a love of opposition, then,’ he said. ‘Never mind—it will be all right. It’s nothing desperate.’
“那么，这就是对反对的热爱，”他说。 ‘没关系——不会有事的。这并不令人绝望。

‘Yes,’ she wept, ‘it is, it is.’
“是的，”她哭着说，“是的，是的。”

‘Why?’
'为什么？'

‘I shall never see him again—‘
“我再也见不到他了——”

‘Not immediately. Don’t cry, you had to break with him, it had to be—don’t cry.’
‘不是立即。别哭，你必须和他分手，一定是——别哭。

He went over to her and kissed her fine, fragile hair, touching her wet cheeks gently.
他走到她身边，亲吻她纤细脆弱的头发，温柔地抚摸她湿润的脸颊。

‘Don’t cry,’ he repeated, ‘don’t cry any more.’
“别哭，”他重复道，“别再哭了。”

He held her head close against him, very close and quiet.
他把她的头紧紧地抱在自己身上，非常近，也很安静。

At last she was still. Then she looked up, her eyes wide and frightened.
最后她还是不动了。然后她抬起头来，眼睛睁得大大的，充满了恐惧。

‘Don’t you want me?’ she asked.
“你不想要我吗？”她问。

‘Want you?’ His darkened, steady eyes puzzled her and did not give her play.
“想要你吗？”他那双漆黑、坚定的眼睛让她困惑不解，没有理会她。

‘Do you wish I hadn’t come?’ she asked, anxious now again for fear she might be out of place.
“你希望我不来吗？”她问，现在又担心自己可能会不合适。

‘No,’ he said. ‘I wish there hadn’t been the violence—so much ugliness—but perhaps it was inevitable.’
“不，”他说。 “我希望没有发生暴力——如此丑陋——但也许这是不可避免的。”

She watched him in silence. He seemed deadened.
她默默地看着他。他看上去已经死了。

‘But where shall I stay?’ she asked, feeling humiliated.
“但是我该住在哪里呢？”她问道，感到受到了羞辱。

He thought for a moment.
他想了一会儿。

‘Here, with me,’ he said. ‘We’re married as much today as we shall be tomorrow.’
“在这里，和我在一起，”他说。 “我们今天结婚了，明天也结婚了。”

‘But—‘
'但-'

‘I’ll tell Mrs Varley,’ he said. ‘Never mind now.’
“我会告诉瓦利夫人，”他说。 “现在没关系。”

He sat looking at her. She could feel his darkened steady eyes looking at her all the time. It made her a little bit frightened. She pushed her hair off her forehead nervously.
他坐着看着她。她能感觉到他那双漆黑的眸子一直在注视着她。这让她有些害怕。她紧张地把额前的头发拨开。

‘Do I look ugly?’ she said.
“我看起来丑吗？”她说。

And she blew her nose again.
她又擤了鼻子。

A small smile came round his eyes.
他的眼角浮现出一丝微笑。

‘No,’ he said, ‘fortunately.’
“不，”他说，“幸运的是。”

And he went across to her, and gathered her like a belonging in his arms. She was so tenderly beautiful, he could not bear to see her, he could only bear to hide her against himself. Now; washed all clean by her tears, she was new and frail like a flower just unfolded, a flower so new, so tender, so made perfect by inner light, that he could not bear to look at her, he must hide her against himself, cover his eyes against her. She had the perfect candour of creation, something translucent and simple, like a radiant, shining flower that moment unfolded in primal blessedness. She was so new, so wonder-clear, so undimmed. And he was so old, so steeped in heavy memories. Her soul was new, undefined and glimmering with the unseen. And his soul was dark and gloomy, it had only one grain of living hope, like a grain of mustard seed. But this one living grain in him matched the perfect youth in her.
他走到她身边，将她像一件随身物品一样抱在怀里。她是那么的娇美，他不忍心看她，只能忍着把她藏起来。现在;她的泪水把她洗干净了，她像一朵刚刚绽放的花一样崭新而脆弱，一朵如此新的、如此温柔的花，在内在的光芒下变得如此完美，他无法忍受看她，他必须把她藏在自己身边，遮住她的眼睛。她具有创造的完美坦率，某种半透明而简单的东西，就像一朵在原始幸福中绽放的光芒四射、闪亮的花朵。她是那么新鲜，那么清晰，那么不黯淡。而且他已经那么老了，沉浸在沉重的回忆中。她的灵魂是新的，不确定的，闪烁着看不见的光芒。而他的灵魂是黑暗而阴暗的，只有一粒活着的希望，就像一粒芥菜籽一样。但他身上这一粒活生生的谷物，与她身上完美的青春相得益彰。

‘I love you,’ he whispered as he kissed her, and trembled with pure hope, like a man who is born again to a wonderful, lively hope far exceeding the bounds of death.
“我爱你，”他在亲吻她时轻声说道，并因纯粹的希望而颤抖，就像一个重生的人，带着一种远远超越死亡界限的美妙、活泼的希望。

She could not know how much it meant to him, how much he meant by the few words. Almost childish, she wanted proof, and statement, even over-statement, for everything seemed still uncertain, unfixed to her.
她不知道这对他来说意味着什么，他的这几句话意味着什么。她想要证据、陈述，甚至是夸张的陈述，这几乎是幼稚的，因为一切对她来说似乎仍然不确定、不固定。

But the passion of gratitude with which he received her into his soul, the extreme, unthinkable gladness of knowing himself living and fit to unite with her, he, who was so nearly dead, who was so near to being gone with the rest of his race down the slope of mechanical death, could never be understood by her. He worshipped her as age worships youth, he gloried in her, because, in his one grain of faith, he was young as she, he was her proper mate. This marriage with her was his resurrection and his life.
但他怀着感激之情将她接纳到自己的灵魂中，知道自己还活着并且适合与她结合，他感到极度的、难以想象的高兴，他差点就死了，差一点就和他的其余部分一起消失了。她永远无法理解从机械死亡的斜坡上往下走的过程。他崇拜她，就像年龄崇拜年轻人一样，他以她为荣，因为，在他的一丁点信念中，他和她一样年轻，他是她合适的伴侣。与她的婚姻是他的复活，也是他的生命。

All this she could not know. She wanted to be made much of, to be adored. There were infinite distances of silence between them. How could he tell her of the immanence of her beauty, that was not form, or weight, or colour, but something like a strange, golden light! How could he know himself what her beauty lay in, for him. He said ‘Your nose is beautiful, your chin is adorable.’ But it sounded like lies, and she was disappointed, hurt. Even when he said, whispering with truth, ‘I love you, I love you,’ it was not the real truth. It was something beyond love, such a gladness of having surpassed oneself, of having transcended the old existence. How could he say ‘I’ when he was something new and unknown, not himself at all? This I, this old formula of the age, was a dead letter.
这一切她都不可能知道。她想要被重视，被崇拜。他们之间有无限的沉默距离。他怎么能告诉她她的美丽是内在的，那不是形状、重量或颜色，而是一种奇怪的金色光芒！他自己怎么能知道她的美丽对他来说意味着什么。他说“你的鼻子很漂亮，你的下巴很可爱。”但这听起来像是谎言，她很失望，很受伤。即使他低声说“我爱你，我爱你”，但这也不是事实。那是一种超越爱的东西，一种超越自我、超越旧存在的喜悦。当他是一个新的、未知的东西，而不是他自己时，他怎么能说“我”呢？这个我，这个时代的古老公式，已经是一纸空文。

In the new, superfine bliss, a peace superseding knowledge, there was no I and you, there was only the third, unrealised wonder, the wonder of existing not as oneself, but in a consummation of my being and of her being in a new one, a new, paradisal unit regained from the duality. Nor can I say ‘I love you,’ when I have ceased to be, and you have ceased to be: we are both caught up and transcended into a new oneness where everything is silent, because there is nothing to answer, all is perfect and at one. Speech travels between the separate parts. But in the perfect One there is perfect silence of bliss.
在新的、超美好的幸福中，在一种取代知识的平静中，没有我和你，只有第三个、未实现的奇迹，不是作为自己存在的奇迹，而是我和她在一种新的存在中的完美存在。一是从二元性中重新获得了一个新的、天堂般的单位。当我不再存在，你也不再存在时，我也不能说“我爱你”：我们都被抓住并超越进入一个新的统一体，在那里一切都是沉默的，因为没有什么可以回答，一切都是完美的并在一处。语音在不同的部分之间传播。但在完美的一位身上却有完美的极乐寂静。

They were married by law on the next day, and she did as he bade her, she wrote to her father and mother. Her mother replied, not her father.
第二天，他们就依法结婚了，她照着他的吩咐做了，她写信给她的父母。她的母亲回答道，而不是她的父亲。

She did not go back to school. She stayed with Birkin in his rooms, or at the Mill, moving with him as he moved. But she did not see anybody, save Gudrun and Gerald. She was all strange and wondering as yet, but relieved as by dawn.
她没有回学校。她和伯金一起呆在他的房间里，或者在磨坊里，随着他的移动而与他一起移动。但除了古德伦和杰拉尔德之外，她没有看到任何人。她还很奇怪，很疑惑，但到了黎明时她就松了口气。

Gerald sat talking to her one afternoon in the warm study down at the Mill. Rupert had not yet come home.
一天下午，杰拉尔德坐在磨坊温暖的书房里和她聊天。鲁珀特还没有回家。

‘You are happy?’ Gerald asked her, with a smile.
“你高兴吗？”杰拉德微笑着问她。

‘Very happy!’ she cried, shrinking a little in her brightness.
“太幸福了！”她喊道，脸上的光彩稍稍暗了下来。

‘Yes, one can see it.’
“是的，人们可以看到它。”

‘Can one?’ cried Ursula in surprise.
“可以吗？”乌苏拉惊讶地喊道。

He looked up at her with a communicative smile.
他抬起头看着她，带着交流的微笑。

‘Oh yes, plainly.’
“哦，是的，很明显。”

She was pleased. She meditated a moment.
她很高兴。她沉思了一会儿。

‘And can you see that Rupert is happy as well?’
“你能看到鲁珀特也很高兴吗？”

He lowered his eyelids, and looked aside.
他垂下眼睑，看向一旁。

‘Oh yes,’ he said.
“哦，是的，”他说。

‘Really!’
'真的吗！'

‘Oh yes.’
'哦是的。'

He was very quiet, as if it were something not to be talked about by him. He seemed sad.
他很安静，仿佛这是一件不该与他谈论的事情。他看上去很悲伤。

She was very sensitive to suggestion. She asked the question he wanted her to ask.
她对建议非常敏感。她问了他想让她问的问题。

‘Why don’t you be happy as well?’ she said. ‘You could be just the same.’
“你为什么不开心一点呢？”她说。 “你也可以和以前一样。”

He paused a moment.
他停顿了一下。

‘With Gudrun?’ he asked.
“和古德伦一起？”他问道。

‘Yes!’ she cried, her eyes glowing. But there was a strange tension, an emphasis, as if they were asserting their wishes, against the truth.
“是的！”她喊道，眼睛闪闪发光。但有一种奇怪的紧张感，一种强调，就好像他们在坚持自己的愿望，反对事实。

‘You think Gudrun would have me, and we should be happy?’ he said.
“你认为古德伦会拥有我，我们就会幸福吗？”他说。

‘Yes, I’m SURE!’ she cried.
“是的，我确定！”她喊道。

Her eyes were round with delight. Yet underneath she was constrained, she knew her own insistence.
她的眼睛睁得圆圆的，充满了喜悦。但在她的束缚之下，她知道自己的坚持。

‘Oh, I’m SO glad,’ she added.
“哦，我很高兴，”她补充道。

He smiled.
他笑了。

‘What makes you glad?’ he said.
“什么让你高兴？”他说。

‘For HER sake,’ she replied. ‘I’m sure you’d—you’re the right man for her.’
“为了她，”她回答道。 “我确信你会——你是适合她的男人。”

‘You are?’ he said. ‘And do you think she would agree with you?’
“你是？”他说。 “你认为她会同意你的看法吗？”

‘Oh yes!’ she exclaimed hastily. Then, upon reconsideration, very uneasy: ‘Though Gudrun isn’t so very simple, is she? One doesn’t know her in five minutes, does one? She’s not like me in that.’ She laughed at him with her strange, open, dazzled face.
“哦，是的！”她急忙喊道。然后，转念一想，心里很不安：‘虽然古珍也不是那么简单，不是吗？五分钟之内你就认不出她了，不是吗？她在这一点上跟我不一样。”她用那张奇怪的、开放的、眼花缭乱的脸对他大笑。

‘You think she’s not much like you?’ Gerald asked.
“你认为她不太像你？”杰拉尔德问。

She knitted her brows.
她皱起了眉头。

‘Oh, in many ways she is. But I never know what she will do when anything new comes.’
哦，从很多方面来说她都是。但我永远不知道当有新的事情发生时她会做什么。”

‘You don’t?’ said Gerald. He was silent for some moments. Then he moved tentatively. ‘I was going to ask her, in any case, to go away with me at Christmas,’ he said, in a very small, cautious voice.
“你不这么认为吗？”杰拉尔德说。他沉默了一会儿。然后他试探性地动了动。 “无论如何，我想请她在圣诞节期间和我一起走，”他用非常微小、谨慎的声音说道。

‘Go away with you? For a time, you mean?’
‘和你一起走吗？你是说暂时吗？

‘As long as she likes,’ he said, with a deprecating movement.
“只要她愿意，”他说道，动作有些不以为然。

They were both silent for some minutes.
他们俩都沉默了几分钟。

‘Of course,’ said Ursula at last, ‘she MIGHT just be willing to rush into marriage. You can see.’
“当然，”乌苏拉最后说道，“她可能只是愿意仓促结婚。你可以看到。

‘Yes,’ smiled Gerald. ‘I can see. But in case she won’t—do you think she would go abroad with me for a few days—or for a fortnight?’
“是的，”杰拉尔德微笑着说。 '我可以看到。但万一她不肯——你认为她会和我一起出国几天——还是两周？

‘Oh yes,’ said Ursula. ‘I’d ask her.’
“哦，是的，”乌苏拉说。 “我会问她。”

‘Do you think we might all go together?’
“你觉得我们可以一起去吗？”

‘All of us?’ Again Ursula’s face lighted up. ‘It would be rather fun, don’t you think?’
“我们所有人？”乌苏拉的脸再次亮了起来。 “这会很有趣，你不觉得吗？”

‘Great fun,’ he said.
“很有趣，”他说。

‘And then you could see,’ said Ursula.
“然后你就可以看到了，”乌苏拉说。

‘What?’
'什么？'

‘How things went. I think it is best to take the honeymoon before the wedding—don’t you?’
‘事情进展如何。我认为最好在婚礼前去度蜜月，不是吗？

She was pleased with this MOT. He laughed.
她对这个 MOT 很满意。他笑了。

‘In certain cases,’ he said. ‘I’d rather it were so in my own case.’
“在某些情况下，”他说。 “我宁愿我自己也是如此。”

‘Would you!’ exclaimed Ursula. Then doubtingly, ‘Yes, perhaps you’re right. One should please oneself.’
“你愿意吗？”乌苏拉喊道。然后怀疑地说道，‘是的，也许你是对的。一个人应该取悦自己。

Birkin came in a little later, and Ursula told him what had been said.
伯金稍后进来，乌苏拉告诉了他刚才所说的事情。

‘Gudrun!’ exclaimed Birkin. ‘She’s a born mistress, just as Gerald is a born lover—AMANT EN TITRE. If as somebody says all women are either wives or mistresses, then Gudrun is a mistress.’
“古德伦！”伯​​金喊道。 “她是天生的情妇，就像杰拉尔德是天生的情人一样——AMANT EN TITRE。”如果正如有人所说，所有女人要么是妻子，要么是情妇，那么古德伦就是情妇。

‘And all men either lovers or husbands,’ cried Ursula. ‘But why not both?’
“所有的男人要么是情人，要么是丈夫，”乌苏拉喊道。 “但为什么不两者都做呢？”

‘The one excludes the other,’ he laughed.
他笑道：“两者相互排斥。”

‘Then I want a lover,’ cried Ursula.
“那我想要一个情人，”乌苏拉喊道。

‘No you don’t,’ he said.
“不，你不知道，”他说。

‘But I do,’ she wailed.
“但我愿意，”她哭着说。

He kissed her, and laughed.
他吻了她，然后笑了。

It was two days after this that Ursula was to go to fetch her things from the house in Beldover. The removal had taken place, the family had gone. Gudrun had rooms in Willey Green.
两天后，乌苏拉要去贝尔多弗的家里取东西。搬迁已经发生，一家人都走了。古德伦在威利格林有房间。

Ursula had not seen her parents since her marriage. She wept over the rupture, yet what was the good of making it up! Good or not good, she could not go to them. So her things had been left behind and she and Gudrun were to walk over for them, in the afternoon.
乌苏拉自从结婚以来就没有见过她的父母。她为破裂而哭泣，但弥补又有什么用呢！不管好坏，她都不能去找他们。所以她的东西被留在了那里，她和古德伦将在下午步行过去取它们。

It was a wintry afternoon, with red in the sky, when they arrived at the house. The windows were dark and blank, already the place was frightening. A stark, void entrance-hall struck a chill to the hearts of the girls.
当他们到达家时，那是一个寒冷的下午，天空泛着红色。窗户一片漆黑，一片空白，这个地方已经很可怕了。空荡荡的门厅，让女孩们心里一阵寒意。

‘I don’t believe I dare have come in alone,’ said Ursula. ‘It frightens me.’
“我不敢一个人进来，”乌苏拉说。 “这让我害怕。”

‘Ursula!’ cried Gudrun. ‘Isn’t it amazing! Can you believe you lived in this place and never felt it? How I lived here a day without dying of terror, I cannot conceive!’
“乌苏拉！”古德伦喊道。 ‘这不是很神奇吗！你能相信你住在这个地方却从未感受过它吗？我无法想象我是如何在这里度过一天而没有死于恐惧的！

They looked in the big dining-room. It was a good-sized room, but now a cell would have been lovelier. The large bay windows were naked, the floor was stripped, and a border of dark polish went round the tract of pale boarding.
他们朝大餐厅里望去。这是一个很大的房间，但现在如果是牢房就更可爱了。大凸窗光秃秃的，地板也被剥光了，苍白的木板周围有一圈深色抛光的边缘。

In the faded wallpaper were dark patches where furniture had stood, where pictures had hung. The sense of walls, dry, thin, flimsy-seeming walls, and a flimsy flooring, pale with its artificial black edges, was neutralising to the mind. Everything was null to the senses, there was enclosure without substance, for the walls were dry and papery. Where were they standing, on earth, or suspended in some cardboard box? In the hearth was burnt paper, and scraps of half-burnt paper.
褪色的壁纸上，曾经放过家具、挂过画的地方，有一些黑斑。墙壁的感觉，干燥、薄薄、看似脆弱的墙壁，以及脆弱的地板，人造的黑色边缘显得苍白，对心灵来说是中和的。一切感觉都毫无意义，围墙没有实质内容，因为墙壁干燥如纸。它们站在哪里，是在地球上，还是悬浮在某个纸板箱里？壁炉里有烧焦的纸和半烧焦的纸片。

‘Imagine that we passed our days here!’ said Ursula.
“想象一下我们在这里度过了我们的日子！”乌苏拉说。

‘I know,’ cried Gudrun. ‘It is too appalling. What must we be like, if we are the contents of THIS!’
“我知道，”古德伦喊道。 ‘这也太骇人听闻了。如果我们是这个的内容，我们必须是什么样子！

‘Vile!’ said Ursula. ‘It really is.’
“可恶！”乌苏拉说。 “确实如此。”

And she recognised half-burnt covers of ‘Vogue’—half-burnt representations of women in gowns—lying under the grate.
她还认出了壁炉下躺着半烧焦的《Vogue》封面——穿着礼服的女性半烧焦的封面。

They went to the drawing-room. Another piece of shut-in air; without weight or substance, only a sense of intolerable papery imprisonment in nothingness. The kitchen did look more substantial, because of the red-tiled floor and the stove, but it was cold and horrid.
他们去了客厅。另一片封闭的空气；没有重量或实质，只有一种难以忍受的虚无纸质禁锢感。厨房确实看起来更宽敞，因为地板是红色的，还有炉子，但又冷又可怕。

The two girls tramped hollowly up the bare stairs. Every sound reechoed under their hearts. They tramped down the bare corridor. Against the wall of Ursula’s bedroom were her things—a trunk, a work-basket, some books, loose coats, a hat-box, standing desolate in the universal emptiness of the dusk.
两个女孩迈着空虚的脚步走上光秃秃的楼梯。每一个声音都在他们的心底回响。他们沿着光秃秃的走廊迈着脚步。乌苏拉卧室的墙上放着她的东西——一个箱子、一个工作篮、一些书、宽松的外套、一个帽盒，荒凉地站在普遍空虚的黄昏中。

‘A cheerful sight, aren’t they?’ said Ursula, looking down at her forsaken possessions.
“真是令人愉快的景象，不是吗？”乌苏拉低头看着她被遗弃的财产说道。

‘Very cheerful,’ said Gudrun.
“非常高兴，”古德伦说。

The two girls set to, carrying everything down to the front door. Again and again they made the hollow, re-echoing transit. The whole place seemed to resound about them with a noise of hollow, empty futility. In the distance the empty, invisible rooms sent forth a vibration almost of obscenity. They almost fled with the last articles, into the out-of-door.
两个女孩开始把所有东西搬到前门。他们一次又一次地进行空洞、回声的过境。整个地方似乎都在他们周围回荡着一种空洞、空洞、徒劳的声音。远处那些空荡荡、看不见的房间发出近乎淫秽的震动。他们几乎带着最后的物品逃到了户外。

But it was cold. They were waiting for Birkin, who was coming with the car. They went indoors again, and upstairs to their parents’ front bedroom, whose windows looked down on the road, and across the country at the black-barred sunset, black and red barred, without light.
但天气很冷。他们正在等待和车一起来的伯金。他们又进了屋，上楼来到父母的前卧室，从卧室的窗户可以看到下面的马路，以及整个国家的黑边日落，黑红相间，没有光线。

They sat down in the window-seat, to wait. Both girls were looking over the room. It was void, with a meaninglessness that was almost dreadful.
他们坐在靠窗的座位上等待。两个女孩都在环顾房间。它是空的，毫无意义，几乎是可怕的。

‘Really,’ said Ursula, ‘this room COULDN’T be sacred, could it?’
“真的，”乌苏拉说，“这个房间不可能是神圣的，不是吗？”

Gudrun looked over it with slow eyes.
古德伦用缓慢的目光看着它。

‘Impossible,’ she replied.
“不可能，”她回答道。

‘When I think of their lives—father’s and mother’s, their love, and their marriage, and all of us children, and our bringing-up—would you have such a life, Prune?’
“当我想到他们的生活——父亲和母亲的生活、他们的爱情、他们的婚姻、以及我们所有的孩子和我们的成长过程——你会拥有这样的生活吗，普鲁？”

‘I wouldn’t, Ursula.’
“我不会，乌苏拉。”

‘It all seems so NOTHING—their two lives—there’s no meaning in it. Really, if they had NOT met, and NOT married, and not lived together—it wouldn’t have mattered, would it?’
“这一切看起来都没什么——他们的两个人生——没有任何意义。”真的，如果他们没有见面，没有结婚，没有住在一起，那也没关系，不是吗？

‘Of course—you can’t tell,’ said Gudrun.
“当然——你看不出来，”古德伦说。

‘No. But if I thought my life was going to be like it—Prune,’ she caught Gudrun’s arm, ‘I should run.’
'不。但如果我认为我的生活会像普鲁恩那样，”她抓住古德伦的手臂，“我就应该逃跑。”

Gudrun was silent for a few moments.
古德伦沉默了一会儿。

‘As a matter of fact, one cannot contemplate the ordinary life—one cannot contemplate it,’ replied Gudrun. ‘With you, Ursula, it is quite different. You will be out of it all, with Birkin. He’s a special case. But with the ordinary man, who has his life fixed in one place, marriage is just impossible. There may be, and there ARE, thousands of women who want it, and could conceive of nothing else. But the very thought of it sends me MAD. One must be free, above all, one must be free. One may forfeit everything else, but one must be free—one must not become 7, Pinchbeck Street—or Somerset Drive—or Shortlands. No man will be sufficient to make that good—no man! To marry, one must have a free lance, or nothing, a comrade-in-arms, a Glckstritter. A man with a position in the social world—well, it is just impossible, impossible!’
“事实上，一个人无法思考平凡的生活——一个人无法思考它，”古德伦回答道。 “乌苏拉，有了你，一切就完全不同了。有了 Birkin，你将摆脱这一切。他是一个特例。但对于生活固定在一处的普通人来说，婚姻是不可能的。可能有，而且确实有，成千上万的女性想要它，但又无法怀孕。但一想到它就让我发疯。人必须是自由的，最重要的是，人必须是自由的。一个人可以放弃其他一切，但一个人必须自由——一个人不能成为平奇贝克街7号——或萨默塞特大道——或肖特兰兹。没有人足以做到这一点——没有人！要结婚，一个人必须拥有一名自由职业者，或者什么都没有，一个战友，一个Glckstritter。一个在社会上有地位的人——嗯，这是不可能的，不可能的！

‘What a lovely word—a Glckstritter!’ said Ursula. ‘So much nicer than a soldier of fortune.’
“多么可爱的词啊——Glckstritter！”乌苏拉说。 “比财富战士好得多。”

‘Yes, isn’t it?’ said Gudrun. ‘I’d tilt the world with a Glcksritter. But a home, an establishment! Ursula, what would it mean?—think!’
“是的，不是吗？”古德伦说。 “我会用 Glcksritter 来倾斜世界。但一个家，一个机构！乌苏拉，这意味着什么？——想一想！

‘I know,’ said Ursula. ‘We’ve had one home—that’s enough for me.’
“我知道，”乌苏拉说。 “我们有一个家——这对我来说就足够了。”

‘Quite enough,’ said Gudrun.
“够了，”古德伦说。

‘The little grey home in the west,’ quoted Ursula ironically.
“西部的灰色小房子，”乌苏拉讽刺地引用道。

‘Doesn’t it sound grey, too,’ said Gudrun grimly.
“听起来不是也很灰色吗？”古珍冷酷地说。

They were interrupted by the sound of the car. There was Birkin. Ursula was surprised that she felt so lit up, that she became suddenly so free from the problems of grey homes in the west.
他们的谈话被汽车的声音打断了。有柏金包。乌苏拉感到惊讶的是，她感觉如此明亮，突然间摆脱了西方灰色房屋的问题。

They heard his heels click on the hall pavement below.
他们听到他的脚跟踩在下面大厅的人行道上。

‘Hello!’ he called, his voice echoing alive through the house. Ursula smiled to herself. HE was frightened of the place too.
“你好！”他喊道，他的声音在房子里回荡。乌苏拉对自己微笑。他也害怕这个地方。

‘Hello! Here we are,’ she called downstairs. And they heard him quickly running up.
'你好！我们到了。”她在楼下喊道。他们听到他飞快地跑过来。

‘This is a ghostly situation,’ he said.
“这是一个幽灵般的情况，”他说。

‘These houses don’t have ghosts—they’ve never had any personality, and only a place with personality can have a ghost,’ said Gudrun.
“这些房子没有鬼魂——它们从来没有任何个性，只有有个性的地方才会有鬼魂，”古德伦说。

‘I suppose so. Are you both weeping over the past?’
'我想是这样。你们都在为过去的事哭泣吗？

‘We are,’ said Gudrun, grimly.
“我们是，”古德伦冷酷地说。

Ursula laughed.
乌苏拉笑了。

‘Not weeping that it’s gone, but weeping that it ever WAS,’ she said.
“不是因为它消失而哭泣，而是因为它曾经存在而哭泣，”她说。

‘Oh,’ he replied, relieved.
“哦，”他松了一口气，回答道。

He sat down for a moment. There was something in his presence, Ursula thought, lambent and alive. It made even the impertinent structure of this null house disappear.
他坐了一会儿。乌苏拉想，他的存在里有某种东西，柔和而充满活力。甚至连这座空屋的不合时宜的结构都消失了。

‘Gudrun says she could not bear to be married and put into a house,’ said Ursula meaningful—they knew this referred to Gerald.
“古德伦说她无法忍受结婚并被安置在一个房子里，”乌苏拉意味深长地说——他们知道这指的是杰拉尔德。

He was silent for some moments.
他沉默了一会儿。

‘Well,’ he said, ‘if you know beforehand you couldn’t stand it, you’re safe.’
“好吧，”他说，“如果你事先知道自己无法忍受，那么你就安全了。”

‘Quite!’ said Gudrun.
“确实如此！”古德伦说。

‘Why DOES every woman think her aim in life is to have a hubby and a little grey home in the west? Why is this the goal of life? Why should it be?’ said Ursula.
“为什么每个女人都认为自己的人生目标是在西方拥有一个丈夫和一个灰色的小家？为什么这是人生的目标？为什么会这样？”乌苏拉说。

‘Il faut avoir le respect de ses btises,’ said Birkin.
“我要尊重这些人，”伯金说。

‘But you needn’t have the respect for the BETISE before you’ve committed it,’ laughed Ursula.
乌苏拉笑着说，“但在你做出决定之前，你不必尊重 BETISE”。

‘Ah then, des betises du papa?’
“啊，那么，爸爸的赌注呢？”

‘Et de la maman,’ added Gudrun satirically.
“Et de la maman，”古德伦讽刺地补充道。

‘Et des voisins,’ said Ursula.
“Et des voisins，”乌苏拉说。

They all laughed, and rose. It was getting dark. They carried the things to the car. Gudrun locked the door of the empty house. Birkin had lighted the lamps of the automobile. It all seemed very happy, as if they were setting out.
他们都笑了，站了起来。天开始黑了。他们把东西搬到车上。古德伦锁上了空房子的门。伯金点亮了汽车灯。一切看起来都很幸福，就好像他们要出发一样。

‘Do you mind stopping at Coulsons. I have to leave the key there,’ said Gudrun.
“你介意在科尔森停一下吗？”我得把钥匙留在那里，”古德伦说。

‘Right,’ said Birkin, and they moved off.
“好吧，”伯金说，然后他们就出发了。

They stopped in the main street. The shops were just lighted, the last miners were passing home along the causeways, half-visible shadows in their grey pit-dirt, moving through the blue air. But their feet rang harshly in manifold sound, along the pavement.
他们在大街上停了下来。商店刚刚亮灯，最后一批矿工正沿着堤道回家，灰色的矿坑泥土中隐约可​​见的影子在蓝色的空气中移动。但他们的脚步声沿着人行道发出刺耳的声音。

How pleased Gudrun was to come out of the shop, and enter the car, and be borne swiftly away into the downhill of palpable dusk, with Ursula and Birkin! What an adventure life seemed at this moment! How deeply, how suddenly she envied Ursula! Life for her was so quick, and an open door—so reckless as if not only this world, but the world that was gone and the world to come were nothing to her. Ah, if she could be JUST LIKE THAT, it would be perfect.
古德伦从商店出来，钻进车里，和乌苏拉和伯金一起迅速驶入明显黄昏的下坡路，这是多么高兴啊！这一刻，生活显得多么冒险啊！她突然多么深深地羡慕乌苏拉啊！对她来说，生命如此短暂，一扇敞开的门——如此鲁莽，仿佛不仅这个世界，连过去的世界和未来的世界对她来说都不算什么。啊，如果她也能这样，那就完美了。

For always, except in her moments of excitement, she felt a want within herself. She was unsure. She had felt that now, at last, in Gerald’s strong and violent love, she was living fully and finally. But when she compared herself with Ursula, already her soul was jealous, unsatisfied. She was not satisfied—she was never to be satisfied.
一直以来，除了兴奋的时刻，她总是感到自己内心有一种渴望。她不确定。她觉得现在，在杰拉尔德强烈而猛烈的爱中，她终于活得充实了。但当她将自己与乌苏拉相比时，她的灵魂已经嫉妒、不满足了。她不满足——她永远不会满足。

What was she short of now? It was marriage—it was the wonderful stability of marriage. She did want it, let her say what she might. She had been lying. The old idea of marriage was right even now—marriage and the home. Yet her mouth gave a little grimace at the words. She thought of Gerald and Shortlands—marriage and the home! Ah well, let it rest! He meant a great deal to her—but—! Perhaps it was not in her to marry. She was one of life’s outcasts, one of the drifting lives that have no root. No, no it could not be so. She suddenly conjured up a rosy room, with herself in a beautiful gown, and a handsome man in evening dress who held her in his arms in the firelight, and kissed her. This picture she entitled ‘Home.’ It would have done for the Royal Academy.
她现在还缺什么？这就是婚姻——这是婚姻的美妙稳定性。她确实想要，让她怎么说吧。她一直在撒谎。婚姻的旧观念即使在现在也是正确的——婚姻和家庭。然而，听到这句话，她的嘴角却露出了一丝苦笑。她想到了杰拉尔德和肖特兰兹——婚姻和家庭！啊，好吧，让它休息吧！他对她来说意义重大——但是——！也许她不适合结婚。她是生活中的弃儿之一，是没有根基的漂泊生命之一。不，不，不可能这样。她突然想象出一个玫瑰色的房间，自己穿着漂亮的礼服，还有一个穿着晚礼服的英俊男人在火光下将她搂在怀里，亲吻着她。她将这张照片命名为“家”。这对于皇家学院来说是可以的。

‘Come with us to tea—DO,’ said Ursula, as they ran nearer to the cottage of Willey Green.
“和我们一起去喝茶吧——一定，”当他们跑近威利·格林的小屋时，乌苏拉说道。

‘Thanks awfully—but I MUST go in—‘ said Gudrun. She wanted very much to go on with Ursula and Birkin.
“非常感谢——但我必须进去——”古德伦说。她非常想和乌苏拉和伯金继续下去。

That seemed like life indeed to her. Yet a certain perversity would not let her.
对她来说，这确实像是生活。然而，某种反常的性格不允许她这么做。

‘Do come—yes, it would be so nice,’ pleaded Ursula.
“一定要来——是的，那就太好了，”乌苏拉恳求道。

‘I’m awfully sorry—I should love to—but I can’t—really—‘
“我非常抱歉——我很乐意——但我不能——真的——”

She descended from the car in trembling haste.
她战战兢兢地匆忙从车上下来。

‘Can’t you really!’ came Ursula’s regretful voice.
“你真的不能吗？”乌苏拉遗憾的声音传来。

‘No, really I can’t,’ responded Gudrun’s pathetic, chagrined words out of the dusk.
“不，我真的不能。”暮色中古德伦用可怜而懊恼的话语回答道。

‘All right, are you?’ called Birkin.
“好吧，你是吗？”伯金喊道。

‘Quite!’ said Gudrun. ‘Good-night!’
“确实如此！”古德伦说。 '晚安！'

‘Good-night,’ they called.
“晚安，”他们喊道。

‘Come whenever you like, we shall be glad,’ called Birkin.
“只要你愿意来，我们都会很高兴，”伯金喊道。

‘Thank you very much,’ called Gudrun, in the strange, twanging voice of lonely chagrin that was very puzzling to him. She turned away to her cottage gate, and they drove on. But immediately she stood to watch them, as the car ran vague into the distance. And as she went up the path to her strange house, her heart was full of incomprehensible bitterness.
“非常感谢你，”古德伦用一种奇怪的、带有鼻音的声音喊道，声音里充满了孤独的懊恼，这让他感到非常困惑。她转身朝小屋门口走去，他们继续前行。但当汽车模糊地驶向远方时，她立即站起来看着他们。当她沿着小路走向陌生的房子时，她的心里充满了难以理解的苦涩。

In her parlour was a long-case clock, and inserted into its dial was a ruddy, round, slant-eyed, joyous-painted face, that wagged over with the most ridiculous ogle when the clock ticked, and back again with the same absurd glad-eye at the next tick. All the time the absurd smooth, brown-ruddy face gave her an obtrusive ‘glad-eye.’ She stood for minutes, watching it, till a sort of maddened disgust overcame her, and she laughed at herself hollowly. And still it rocked, and gave her the glad-eye from one side, then from the other, from one side, then from the other. Ah, how unhappy she was! In the midst of her most active happiness, ah, how unhappy she was! She glanced at the table. Gooseberry jam, and the same home-made cake with too much soda in it! Still, gooseberry jam was good, and one so rarely got it.
她的客厅里有一个长壳钟，表盘上嵌着一张红润的、圆圆的、斜眼的、画着欢乐的脸，当时钟滴答作响时，它以最可笑的眼神摇来摇去，然后又以同样荒谬的方式摇回来。高兴地看着下一个刻度。那张荒唐光滑、棕红色的脸一直给她一种引人注目的“高兴的眼睛”。她站了几分钟，看着它，直到一种疯狂的厌恶征服了她，她空洞地嘲笑自己。它仍然摇晃着，从一侧，然后从另一侧，从一侧，然后从另一侧向她投来喜悦的目光。啊，她多么不高兴啊！在她最积极的幸福之中，啊，她多么不高兴啊！她看了一眼桌子。醋栗果酱，还有同样的自制蛋糕，里面加了太多苏打水！不过，醋栗酱还是不错的，但很少有人能买到。

All the evening she wanted to go to the Mill. But she coldly refused to allow herself. She went the next afternoon instead. She was happy to find Ursula alone. It was a lovely, intimate secluded atmosphere. They talked endlessly and delightedly. ‘Aren’t you FEARFULLY happy here?’ said Gudrun to her sister glancing at her own bright eyes in the mirror. She always envied, almost with resentment, the strange positive fullness that subsisted in the atmosphere around Ursula and Birkin.
整个晚上她都想去磨坊。但她冷冷地拒绝让自己这么做。她第二天下午就去了。她很高兴能单独找到乌苏拉。这是一种可爱、亲密、僻静的氛围。他们聊得很开心，没完没了。 “你在这里不是非常高兴吗？”古德兰对着镜子里自己明亮的眼睛的姐姐说道。她总是羡慕，几乎带着怨恨，乌苏拉和伯金周围的气氛中存在着奇怪的积极充实的气氛。

How really beautifully this room is done,’ she said aloud. ‘This hard plaited matting—what a lovely colour it is, the colour of cool light!’
这个房间做得真漂亮啊，”她大声说道。 “这硬编的垫子——多么可爱的颜色啊，冷光的颜色！”

And it seemed to her perfect.
在她看来，这似乎是完美的。

‘Ursula,’ she said at length, in a voice of question and detachment, ‘did you know that Gerald Crich had suggested our going away all together at Christmas?’
“乌苏拉，”她最后用询问和超然的语气说道，“你知道杰拉尔德·克里奇建议我们在圣诞节一起离开吗？”

‘Yes, he’s spoken to Rupert.’
“是的，他已经和鲁珀特谈过了。”

A deep flush dyed Gudrun’s cheek. She was silent a moment, as if taken aback, and not knowing what to say.
古德伦的脸颊染上了深深的红晕。她沉默了片刻，像是吃了一惊，不知道该说什么。

‘But don’t you thing,’ she said at last, ‘it is AMAZINGLY COOL !’
“但是你不觉得吗，”她最后说道，“这太酷了！”

Ursula laughed.
乌苏拉笑了。

‘I like him for it,’ she said.
“我喜欢他这一点，”她说。

Gudrun was silent. It was evident that, whilst she was almost mortified by Gerald’s taking the liberty of making such a suggestion to Birkin, yet the idea itself attracted her strongly.
古德伦沉默了。显然，虽然杰拉尔德冒昧地向柏金提出这样的建议，她几乎感到羞愧，但这个想法本身却强烈地吸引了她。

‘There’s rather lovely simplicity about Gerald, I think,’ said Ursula, ‘so defiant, somehow! Oh, I think he’s VERY lovable.’
“我认为杰拉尔德有一种相当可爱的单纯，”乌苏拉说，“不知何故，如此挑衅！哦，我认为他非常可爱。

Gudrun did not reply for some moments. She had still to get over the feeling of insult at the liberty taken with her freedom.
古德伦一时没有回答。她还需要克服因自由而被剥夺的侮辱感。

‘What did Rupert say—do you know?’ she asked.
“鲁珀特说了什么——你知道吗？”她问道。

‘He said it would be most awfully jolly,’ said Ursula.
“他说那会非常快乐，”乌苏拉说。

Again Gudrun looked down, and was silent.
古德伦再次低下头，沉默了。

‘Don’t you think it would?’ said Ursula, tentatively. She was never quite sure how many defences Gudrun was having round herself.
“你不认为会吗？”乌苏拉试探性地说。她从来不太确定古德伦在自己周围有多少防御。

Gudrun raised her face with difficulty and held it averted.
古珍艰难地抬起脸，并把它移开。

‘I think it MIGHT be awfully jolly, as you say,’ she replied. ‘But don’t you think it was an unpardonable liberty to take—to talk of such things to Rupert—who after all—you see what I mean, Ursula—they might have been two men arranging an outing with some little TYPE they’d picked up. Oh, I think it’s unforgivable, quite!’ She used the French word ‘TYPE.’
“我认为这可能会非常快乐，正如你所说，”她回答道。 “但是你不认为这是一种不可原谅的自由——与鲁珀特谈论这样的事情——毕竟——你明白我的意思，乌苏拉——他们可能是两个男人在安排一次郊游，带着他们的某种小类型” d 接起来。哦，我认为这是不可原谅的！”她用了法语单词“TYPE”。

Her eyes flashed, her soft face was flushed and sullen. Ursula looked on, rather frightened, frightened most of all because she thought Gudrun seemed rather common, really like a little TYPE. But she had not the courage quite to think this—not right out.
她的眸子里闪烁着光芒，柔软的脸庞涨得通红，阴沉着。乌苏拉在一旁看着，颇为害怕，最害怕的是因为她觉得古德伦看起来很普通，真的很像一个小类型。但她没有足够的勇气去想这个——没有直接想出来。

‘Oh no,’ she cried, stammering. ‘Oh no—not at all like that—oh no! No, I think it’s rather beautiful, the friendship between Rupert and Gerald. They just are simple—they say anything to each other, like brothers.’
“哦，不，”她结结巴巴地喊道。 ‘哦不——一点也不那样——哦不！不，我认为鲁珀特和杰拉尔德之间的友谊相当美丽。他们很简单——他们像兄弟一样互相倾诉。

Gudrun flushed deeper. She could not BEAR it that Gerald gave her away—even to Birkin.
古德伦的脸更红了。她无法忍受杰拉德出卖了她——甚至出卖了柏金。

‘But do you think even brothers have any right to exchange confidences of that sort?’ she asked, with deep anger.
“但是你认为即使是兄弟也有权利交换这种秘密吗？”她愤怒地问道。

‘Oh yes,’ said Ursula. ‘There’s never anything said that isn’t perfectly straightforward. No, the thing that’s amazed me most in Gerald—how perfectly simple and direct he can be! And you know, it takes rather a big man. Most of them MUST be indirect, they are such cowards.’
“哦，是的，”乌苏拉说。 ‘从来没有什么话不是完全直截了当的。不，最让我惊讶的是杰拉德——他是多么的简单和直接！你知道，这需要一个大人物。他们中的大多数人一定是间接的，他们都是胆小鬼。

But Gudrun was still silent with anger. She wanted the absolute secrecy kept, with regard to her movements.
但古德伦仍然愤怒地保持沉默。她希望对她的行动绝对保密。

‘Won’t you go?’ said Ursula. ‘Do, we might all be so happy! There is something I LOVE about Gerald—he’s MUCH more lovable than I thought him. He’s free, Gudrun, he really is.’
“你不去吗？”乌苏拉说。 ‘这样做，我们都会很幸福！我很喜欢杰拉尔德——他比我想象的更可爱。他自由了，古德伦，他真的自由了。

Gudrun’s mouth was still closed, sullen and ugly. She opened it at length.
古德伦的嘴仍然紧闭着，阴郁而丑陋。她终于打开了它。

‘Do you know where he proposes to go?’ she asked.
“你知道他打算去哪里吗？”她问道。

‘Yes—to the Tyrol, where he used to go when he was in Germany—a lovely place where students go, small and rough and lovely, for winter sport!’
“是的——去蒂罗尔，他在德国时经常去的地方——一个学生们去的可爱的地方，小而粗犷，可爱，进行冬季运动！”

Through Gudrun’s mind went the angry thought—‘they know everything.’
古德伦的脑海里浮现出一个愤怒的念头——“他们什么都知道。”

‘Yes,’ she said aloud, ‘about forty kilometres from Innsbruck, isn’t it?’
“是的，”她大声说道，“距离因斯布鲁克大约四十公里，不是吗？”

‘I don’t know exactly where—but it would be lovely, don’t you think, high in the perfect snow—?’
“我不知道具体在哪里——但你不觉得，在完美的雪地里，那会很可爱吗——？”

‘Very lovely!’ said Gudrun, sarcastically.
“非常可爱！”古德伦讽刺地说。

Ursula was put out.
乌苏拉被赶了出去。

‘Of course,’ she said, ‘I think Gerald spoke to Rupert so that it shouldn’t seem like an outing with a TYPE—‘
“当然，”她说，“我认为杰拉尔德和鲁珀特谈过，这样这看起来就不像是一次与某种类型的郊游——”

‘I know, of course,’ said Gudrun, ‘that he quite commonly does take up with that sort.’
“我当然知道，”古德伦说，“他确实经常做这种事。”

‘Does he!’ said Ursula. ‘Why how do you know?’
“是吗？”乌苏拉说。 “你怎么知道？”

‘I know of a model in Chelsea,’ said Gudrun coldly. Now Ursula was silent. ‘Well,’ she said at last, with a doubtful laugh, ‘I hope he has a good time with her.’ At which Gudrun looked more glum.
“我认识切尔西的一个模特，”古德伦冷冷地说。现在乌苏拉沉默了。 “好吧，”她最后说，带着怀疑的笑声，“我希望他和她玩得很开心。” 古德伦看上去更加闷闷不乐。

CHAPTER XXVIII
第二十八章

GUDRUN IN THE POMPADOUR
蓬巴杜宫中的古德伦

Christmas drew near, all four prepared for flight. Birkin and Ursula were busy packing their few personal things, making them ready to be sent off, to whatever country and whatever place they might choose at last. Gudrun was very much excited. She loved to be on the wing.
圣诞节临近，四人都准备乘飞机。伯金和乌苏拉正忙着收拾他们的一些私人物品，准备好被送去他们最终可能选择的任何国家和任何地方。古德伦非常兴奋。她喜欢呆在边路。

She and Gerald, being ready first, set off via London and Paris to Innsbruck, where they would meet Ursula and Birkin. In London they stayed one night. They went to the music-hall, and afterwards to the Pompadour Cafe.
她和杰拉德首先做好准备，经伦敦和巴黎出发前往因斯布鲁克，在那里他们会见乌苏拉和伯金。他们在伦敦住了一晚。他们去了音乐厅，然后去了蓬巴杜咖啡馆。

Gudrun hated the Cafe, yet she always went back to it, as did most of the artists of her acquaintance. She loathed its atmosphere of petty vice and petty jealousy and petty art. Yet she always called in again, when she was in town. It was as if she HAD to return to this small, slow, central whirlpool of disintegration and dissolution: just give it a look.
古德伦讨厌咖啡馆，但她总是会回去，就像她认识的大多数艺术家一样。她厌恶这里充斥着小恶习、小嫉妒和小艺术的氛围。然而，当她进城时，她总是会再次打电话过来。就好像她必须回到这个小小的、缓慢的、瓦解和溶解的中心漩涡：只要看看它。

She sat with Gerald drinking some sweetish liqueur, and staring with black, sullen looks at the various groups of people at the tables. She would greet nobody, but young men nodded to her frequently, with a kind of sneering familiarity. She cut them all. And it gave her pleasure to sit there, cheeks flushed, eyes black and sullen, seeing them all objectively, as put away from her, like creatures in some menagerie of apish degraded souls. God, what a foul crew they were! Her blood beat black and thick in her veins with rage and loathing. Yet she must sit and watch, watch. One or two people came to speak to her. From every side of the Cafe, eyes turned half furtively, half jeeringly at her, men looking over their shoulders, women under their hats.
她和杰拉尔德坐在一起，喝着甜甜的利口酒，用阴沉的眼神盯着餐桌上的各色人群。她不会和任何人打招呼，但年轻男子却经常向她点头，带着一种嘲讽的熟悉感。她把它们全部剪掉了。她很高兴坐在那里，脸颊通红，眼睛又黑又阴沉，客观地看待他们所有人，就像远离她的人一样，就像某个动物园里的动物，里面有猿猴般的堕落灵魂。天哪，他们是一群多么肮脏的船员啊！她的血管里的血液因愤怒和厌恶而变得又黑又浓。但她必须坐下来观看，观看。一两个人走过来和她说话。咖啡馆的四面八方都有目光半偷偷地、半嘲弄地看着她，男人们回头看，女人们则躲在帽子下。

The old crowd was there, Carlyon in his corner with his pupils and his girl, Halliday and Libidnikov and the Pussum—they were all there. Gudrun watched Gerald. She watched his eyes linger a moment on Halliday, on Halliday’s party. These last were on the look-out—they nodded to him, he nodded again. They giggled and whispered among themselves. Gerald watched them with the steady twinkle in his eyes. They were urging the Pussum to something.
老人们都在那里，卡里昂在他的角落里，带着他的学生和他的女儿，哈利迪、利比德尼科夫和普苏姆——他们都在那里。古德伦看着杰拉德。她看着他的目光在哈利迪身上、哈利迪的派对上停留了一会儿。最后的这些人正在监视——他们向他点点头，他又点点头。他们咯咯笑着，窃窃私语。杰拉德看着他们，眼睛里闪烁着坚定的光芒。他们正在敦促普苏姆做某事。

She at last rose. She was wearing a curious dress of dark silk splashed and spattered with different colours, a curious motley effect. She was thinner, her eyes were perhaps hotter, more disintegrated. Otherwise she was just the same. Gerald watched her with the same steady twinkle in his eyes as she came across. She held out her thin brown hand to him.
她终于站了起来。她穿着一件奇怪的深色丝绸连衣裙，上面溅满了不同的颜色，形成一种奇怪的杂色效果。她更瘦了，眼睛也许更热，更崩溃了。否则她就跟以前一样了。杰拉尔德看着她，眼睛里闪烁着和她走过时一样的坚定的光芒。她向他伸出那只瘦瘦的棕色手。

‘How are you?’ she said.
“你好吗？”她说。

He shook hands with her, but remained seated, and let her stand near him, against the table. She nodded blackly to Gudrun, whom she did not know to speak to, but well enough by sight and reputation.
他与她握手，但仍然坐着，让她站在他旁边，靠着桌子。她阴沉地向古德伦点了点头，她不知道该跟他说话，但从她的视线和声誉来看，她已经足够了解他了。

‘I am very well,’ said Gerald. ‘And you?’
“我很好，”杰拉尔德说。 '你呢？'

‘Oh I’m all wight. What about Wupert?’
‘哦，我没事了。伍珀特呢？

‘Rupert? He’s very well, too.’
‘鲁珀特？他也很好。

‘Yes, I don’t mean that. What about him being married?’
‘是的，我不是这个意思。他结婚了怎么办？

‘Oh—yes, he is married.’
“哦——是的，他结婚了。”

The Pussum’s eyes had a hot flash.
普苏姆的眼睛里闪着热光。

‘Oh, he’s weally bwought it off then, has he? When was he married?’
“哦，那么他就彻底摆脱了这一切，不是吗？”他什么时候结婚的？

‘A week or two ago.’
“一两周前。”

‘Weally! He’s never written.’
‘威利！他从来没有写过书。

‘No.’
'不。'

‘No. Don’t you think it’s too bad?’
'不。你不觉得这太糟糕了吗？

This last was in a tone of challenge. The Pussum let it be known by her tone, that she was aware of Gudrun’s listening.
最后这句话带着挑战的语气。小猫从她的语气中可以看出，她知道古德伦在听。

‘I suppose he didn’t feel like it,’ replied Gerald.
“我想他不喜欢这样，”杰拉德回答道。

‘But why didn’t he?’ pursued the Pussum.
“但是他为什么不呢？”猫咪追问。

This was received in silence. There was an ugly, mocking persistence in the small, beautiful figure of the short-haired girl, as she stood near Gerald.
这是在沉默中接受的。当这个短发女孩站在杰拉尔德身边时，她娇小而美丽的身材里有一种丑陋的、嘲讽的坚持。

‘Are you staying in town long?’ she asked.
“你要在城里待很久吗？”她问道。

‘Tonight only.’
“仅限今晚。”

‘Oh, only tonight. Are you coming over to speak to Julius?’
‘哦，只有今晚。你是过来跟朱利叶斯说话吗？

‘Not tonight.’
'不是今晚。'

‘Oh very well. I’ll tell him then.’ Then came her touch of diablerie. ‘You’re looking awf’lly fit.’
'哦，很好。到时候我会告诉他的。”然后她的口吻传来了恶魔般的声音。 “你看起来非常健康。”

‘Yes—I feel it.’ Gerald was quite calm and easy, a spark of satiric amusement in his eye.
“是的——我感觉到了。”杰拉德很平静，很从容，眼中闪烁着讽刺的笑意。

‘Are you having a good time?’
'你现在玩的爽不？'

This was a direct blow for Gudrun, spoken in a level, toneless voice of callous ease.
这对古德伦来说是一个直接的打击，他的语气平淡无奇，冷酷无情。

‘Yes,’ he replied, quite colourlessly.
“是的，”他毫无表情地回答道。

‘I’m awf’lly sorry you aren’t coming round to the flat. You aren’t very faithful to your fwiends.’
“我非常抱歉你没有来公寓。”你对你的朋友不太忠诚。

‘Not very,’ he said.
“不太好，”他说。

She nodded them both ‘Good-night’, and went back slowly to her own set. Gudrun watched her curious walk, stiff and jerking at the loins. They heard her level, toneless voice distinctly.
她向他们俩点了点头“晚安”，然后慢慢地回到了自己的房间。古德伦看着她好奇的走路姿势，僵硬且腰部抽搐。他们清楚地听到她平静、平淡的声音。

‘He won’t come over;—he is otherwise engaged,’ it said. There was more laughter and lowered voices and mockery at the table.
“他不会过来；——他另有事，”上面写着。餐桌上的笑声、压低的声音和嘲笑声更多了。

‘Is she a friend of yours?’ said Gudrun, looking calmly at Gerald.
“她是你的朋友吗？”古德伦平静地看着杰拉德说道。

‘I’ve stayed at Halliday’s flat with Birkin,’ he said, meeting her slow, calm eyes. And she knew that the Pussum was one of his mistresses—and he knew she knew.
“我和伯金一起住在哈利迪的公寓里，”他说，看着她缓慢而平静的眼睛。她知道猫咪是他的情妇之一——他也知道她知道。

She looked round, and called for the waiter. She wanted an iced cocktail, of all things. This amused Gerald—he wondered what was up.
她环顾四周，叫来了服务员。她最想要的是一杯冰镇鸡尾酒。这让杰拉尔德觉得好笑——他想知道发生了什么事。

The Halliday party was tipsy, and malicious. They were talking out loudly about Birkin, ridiculing him on every point, particularly on his marriage.
哈利迪一行人喝得酩酊大醉，而且充满恶意。他们大声谈论伯金，在各个方面嘲笑他，尤其是他的婚姻。

‘Oh, DON’T make me think of Birkin,’ Halliday was squealing. ‘He makes me perfectly sick. He is as bad as Jesus. ‘Lord, WHAT must I do to be saved!‘‘
“哦，别让我想起柏金包，”哈利迪尖叫道。 “他让我恶心极了。他和耶稣一样坏。 “主啊，我必须做什么才能得救！”

He giggled to himself tipsily.
他醉醺醺地咯咯笑起来。

‘Do you remember,’ came the quick voice of the Russian, ‘the letters he used to send. ‘Desire is holy-‘‘
“你还记得吗？”俄罗斯人急促的声音传来，“他以前寄过的信。” “欲望是神圣的——”

‘Oh yes!’ cried Halliday. ‘Oh, how perfectly splendid. Why, I’ve got one in my pocket. I’m sure I have.’
“哦，是的！”哈利迪喊道。 ‘哦，多么完美啊。为什么，我口袋里有一个。我确信我有。

He took out various papers from his pocket book.
他从口袋里拿出各种文件。

‘I’m sure I’ve—HIC! OH DEAR!—got one.’
“我确信我已经——HIC！噢，亲爱的！——有一个。

Gerald and Gudrun were watching absorbedly.
杰拉尔德和古德伦全神贯注地看着。

‘Oh yes, how perfectly—HIC!—splendid! Don’t make me laugh, Pussum, it gives me the hiccup. Hic!—‘ They all giggled.
“哦，是的，多么完美——HIC！——太棒了！别让我笑，普苏姆，这会让我打嗝。嗨！——”他们都咯咯地笑起来。

‘What did he say in that one?’ the Pussum asked, leaning forward, her dark, soft hair falling and swinging against her face. There was something curiously indecent, obscene, about her small, longish, dark skull, particularly when the ears showed.
“他在那封信里说了什么？”猫咪问道，身体前倾，柔软的黑发垂落下来，在脸上晃动。她那又小又长又黑的头骨有一种奇怪的不雅、淫秽的感觉，尤其是当耳朵露出来的时候。

‘Wait—oh do wait! NO-O, I won’t give it to you, I’ll read it aloud. I’ll read you the choice bits,—hic! Oh dear! Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup? HIC! Oh, I feel perfectly helpless.’
‘等等——噢，等等！不，哦，我不会给你，我会大声读出来。我会读给你选择的部分，——呃！哦亲爱的！你认为如果我喝水就能消除打嗝吗？嗝！哦，我感到非常无助。

‘Isn’t that the letter about uniting the dark and the light—and the Flux of Corruption?’ asked Maxim, in his precise, quick voice.
“这不是一封关于联合黑暗与光明以及腐败之流的信吗？”马克西姆用他精确而敏捷的声音问道。

‘I believe so,’ said the Pussum.
“我相信是这样，”猫咪说。

‘Oh is it? I’d forgotten—HIC!—it was that one,’ Halliday said, opening the letter. ‘HIC! Oh yes. How perfectly splendid! This is one of the best. ‘There is a phase in every race—‘‘ he read in the sing-song, slow, distinct voice of a clergyman reading the Scriptures, ‘“When the desire for destruction overcomes every other desire. In the individual, this desire is ultimately a desire for destruction in the self’—HIC!—‘ he paused and looked up.
‘噢，是吗？我忘了——HIC！——就是那封信，”哈利迪打开信说道。 '嗝！哦是的。多么完美灿烂啊！这是最好的之一。 “每场比赛都有一个阶段——”他用牧师朗诵经文时缓慢而清晰的歌声读到，“当毁灭的欲望战胜了其他一切欲望时。对个人来说，这种欲望最终是一种毁灭自我的欲望’——HIC！——”他停了下来，抬起头。

‘I hope he’s going ahead with the destruction of himself,’ said the quick voice of the Russian. Halliday giggled, and lolled his head back, vaguely.
“我希望他继续自我毁灭，”俄罗斯人急促的声音说道。哈利迪咯咯地笑着，含糊地把头向后仰去。

‘There’s not much to destroy in him,’ said the Pussum. ‘He’s so thin already, there’s only a fag-end to start on.’
“他身上没有什么可以毁掉的，”猫咪说。 “他已经这么瘦了，只剩下一根尾巴了。”

‘Oh, isn’t it beautiful! I love reading it! I believe it has cured my hiccup!’ squealed Halliday. ‘Do let me go on. ‘It is a desire for the reduction process in oneself, a reducing back to the origin, a return along the Flux of Corruption, to the original rudimentary conditions of being—!’ Oh, but I DO think it is wonderful. It almost supersedes the Bible-’
‘噢，这不是很漂亮吗！我喜欢读它！我相信它已经治好了我的打嗝！”哈利迪尖叫道。 ‘请让我继续说下去。 “这是一种对自身还原过程的渴望，还原到原点，沿着腐败的潮流回归到最初的基本状态——！”哦，但我确实认为这很棒。它几乎取代了《圣经》——”

‘Yes—Flux of Corruption,’ said the Russian, ‘I remember that phrase.’
“是的——腐败泛滥，”俄罗斯人说，“我记得这句话。”

‘Oh, he was always talking about Corruption,’ said the Pussum. ‘He must be corrupt himself, to have it so much on his mind.’
“哦，他总是在谈论腐败，”小猫说。 “他自己一定很腐败，才会这么想。”

‘Exactly!’ said the Russian.
“完全正确！”俄罗斯人说。

‘Do let me go on! Oh, this is a perfectly wonderful piece! But do listen to this. ‘And in the great retrogression, the reducing back of the created body of life, we get knowledge, and beyond knowledge, the phosphorescent ecstasy of acute sensation.’ Oh, I do think these phrases are too absurdly wonderful. Oh but don’t you think they ARE—they’re nearly as good as Jesus. ‘And if, Julius, you want this ecstasy of reduction with the Pussum, you must go on till it is fulfilled. But surely there is in you also, somewhere, the living desire for positive creation, relationships in ultimate faith, when all this process of active corruption, with all its flowers of mud, is transcended, and more or less finished—‘ I do wonder what the flowers of mud are. Pussum, you are a flower of mud.’
‘让我继续吧！哦，这真是一件美妙的作品！但请听听这个。 “在伟大的倒退中，在被创造的生命体的退化中，我们获得了知识，并且在知识之外，获得了敏锐感觉的磷光狂喜。”哦，我确实认为这些短语太荒谬了。哦，但你不认为他们是吗——他们几乎和耶稣一样好。 ‘如果，朱利叶斯，你想要这种与普苏姆一起减少的狂喜，你必须继续下去，直到它实现为止。但在你内心的某个地方，肯定也存在着对积极创造的活泼渴望，对最终信仰中的关系的渴望，当所有这些积极腐败的过程及其所有的泥土之花都被超越，并且或多或少完成时——“我确实想知道泥花是什么。普苏姆，你是一朵泥土之花。

‘Thank you—and what are you?’
“谢谢你——你是什么？”

‘Oh, I’m another, surely, according to this letter! We’re all flowers of mud—FLEURS—HIC! DU MAL! It’s perfectly wonderful, Birkin harrowing Hell—harrowing the Pompadour—HIC!’
‘哦，根据这封信，我当然是另一个人！我们都是泥花——FLEURS——HIC！杜马尔！这真是太棒了，伯金 (Birkin) 让人痛苦不堪——让人痛苦的庞巴杜 (Pompadour)——HIC！

‘Go on—go on,’ said Maxim. ‘What comes next? It’s really very interesting.’
“继续——继续，”马克西姆说。 '接下来是什么？这真的非常有趣。

‘I think it’s awful cheek to write like that,’ said the Pussum.
“我觉得这样写实在是太厚颜无耻了，”小猫说。

‘Yes—yes, so do I,’ said the Russian. ‘He is a megalomaniac, of course, it is a form of religious mania. He thinks he is the Saviour of man—go on reading.’
“是的——是的，我也是，”俄罗斯人说。 “他是一个狂妄自大的人，当然，这是宗教狂热的一种形式。他认为自己是人类的救世主——继续读吧。

‘Surely,’ Halliday intoned, ‘“surely goodness and mercy hath followed me all the days of my life—‘‘ he broke off and giggled. Then he began again, intoning like a clergyman. ‘“Surely there will come an end in us to this desire—for the constant going apart,—this passion for putting asunder—everything—ourselves, reducing ourselves part from part—reacting in intimacy only for destruction,—using sex as a great reducing agent, reducing the two great elements of male and female from their highly complex unity—reducing the old ideas, going back to the savages for our sensations,—always seeking to LOSE ourselves in some ultimate black sensation, mindless and infinite—burning only with destructive fires, raging on with the hope of being burnt out utterly—‘‘
“当然，”哈利迪吟诵道，““在我一生中，善良和仁慈无疑一直伴随着我——”他停了下来，咯咯地笑起来。然后他又开始了，像牧师一样吟诵。 “我们内心的这种渴望——不断地分离——这种渴望分裂——一切——我们自己，把我们自己一部分一部分地削减——在亲密关系中做出反应，只是为了毁灭——的热情，肯定会结束，——把性作为一种伟大的方式。还原剂，将男性和女性这两个伟大的元素从高度复杂的统一体中还原出来——还原旧观念，回到野蛮人的感觉——总是寻求在某种终极的黑色感觉中迷失自己，无意识和无限——只燃烧伴随着毁灭性的大火，带着被彻底烧毁的希望而肆虐——”

‘I want to go,’ said Gudrun to Gerald, as she signalled the waiter. Her eyes were flashing, her cheeks were flushed. The strange effect of Birkin’s letter read aloud in a perfect clerical sing-song, clear and resonant, phrase by phrase, made the blood mount into her head as if she were mad.
“我想去，”古德伦对杰拉德说道，同时向服务员示意。她的眼睛闪闪发亮，脸颊通红。伯金的信以完美的牧师歌曲的形式大声朗读，其效果奇特，清晰而响亮，逐句逐句，使血液涌入她的头部，仿佛她疯了。

She rose, whilst Gerald was paying the bill, and walked over to Halliday’s table. They all glanced up at her.
当杰拉尔德付账时，她站了起来，走到哈利迪的桌子旁。他们都抬头看了她一眼。

‘Excuse me,’ she said. ‘Is that a genuine letter you are reading?’
“对不起，”她说。 “你正在读的这封信是真的吗？”

‘Oh yes,’ said Halliday. ‘Quite genuine.’
“哦，是的，”哈利迪说。 “非常真诚。”

‘May I see?’
“我可以看看吗？”

Smiling foolishly he handed it to her, as if hypnotised.
他傻乎乎地微笑着，把它递给她，就像被催眠了一样。

‘Thank you,’ she said.
“谢谢你，”她说。

And she turned and walked out of the Cafe with the letter, all down the brilliant room, between the tables, in her measured fashion. It was some moments before anybody realised what was happening.
她转身带着那封信走出咖啡馆，以她谨慎的方式穿过明亮的房间，在桌子之间。过了一会儿，大家才意识到发生了什么事。

From Halliday’s table came half articulate cries, then somebody booed, then all the far end of the place began booing after Gudrun’s retreating form. She was fashionably dressed in blackish-green and silver, her hat was brilliant green, like the sheen on an insect, but the brim was soft dark green, a falling edge with fine silver, her coat was dark green, lustrous, with a high collar of grey fur, and great fur cuffs, the edge of her dress showed silver and black velvet, her stockings and shoes were silver grey. She moved with slow, fashionable indifference to the door. The porter opened obsequiously for her, and, at her nod, hurried to the edge of the pavement and whistled for a taxi. The two lights of a vehicle almost immediately curved round towards her, like two eyes.
哈利迪的桌子上传来半清晰的叫喊声，然后有人发出嘘声，然后在古德伦撤退后，整个地方的远端都开始发出嘘声。她穿着墨绿色和银色的时髦衣服，帽子是翠绿的，就像​​昆虫身上的光泽，但帽檐是柔和的墨绿色，落边上镶着细银，她的外套是墨绿色的，有光泽，高高的。灰色毛皮领子，大毛皮袖口，裙子的边缘露出银色和黑色的天鹅绒，长袜和鞋子都是银灰色的。她缓慢而时尚地冷漠地向门口走去。门房谄媚地为她开门，在她点点头后，急忙跑到人行道边缘，吹口哨叫了一辆出租车。车上的两盏灯几乎立刻就朝她这边转过来，就像两只眼睛。

Gerald had followed in wonder, amid all the booing, not having caught her misdeed. He heard the Pussum’s voice saying:
杰拉德在一片嘘声中惊奇地跟在后面，因为他没有发现她的不当行为。他听到普苏姆的声音说：

‘Go and get it back from her. I never heard of such a thing! Go and get it back from her. Tell Gerald Crich—there he goes—go and make him give it up.’
‘去把它从她那里拿回来。我从来没有听说过这样的事！去把它从她那里拿回来。告诉杰拉尔德·克里奇——他就在那里——去让他放弃吧。

Gudrun stood at the door of the taxi, which the man held open for her.
古德伦站在出租车门口，男人为她打开了门。

‘To the hotel?’ she asked, as Gerald came out, hurriedly.
“去酒店？”当杰拉尔德匆匆走出来时，她问道。

‘Where you like,’ he answered.
“你喜欢去哪里就去哪里，”他回答道。

‘Right!’ she said. Then to the driver, ‘Wagstaff’s—Barton Street.’
“对！”她说。然后对司机说：“瓦格斯塔夫——巴顿街。”

The driver bowed his head, and put down the flag.
司机低下头，放下了旗帜。

Gudrun entered the taxi, with the deliberate cold movement of a woman who is well-dressed and contemptuous in her soul. Yet she was frozen with overwrought feelings. Gerald followed her.
古德伦走进出租车，动作刻意冷酷，就像一个衣着考究、内心充满轻蔑的女人。然而她却因过度紧张的情绪而僵住了。杰拉尔德跟着她。

‘You’ve forgotten the man,’ she said cooly, with a slight nod of her hat. Gerald gave the porter a shilling. The man saluted. They were in motion.
“你忘记了那个男人，”她冷静地说，轻轻地点了点头。杰拉尔德给了搬运工一先令。男人行礼。他们在行动。

‘What was all the row about?’ asked Gerald, in wondering excitement.
“这场争吵到底是为了什么？”杰拉德兴奋地问道。

‘I walked away with Birkin’s letter,’ she said, and he saw the crushed paper in her hand.
“我带着伯金的信走了，”她说，他看到了她手里的碎纸。

His eyes glittered with satisfaction.
他的眼睛里闪烁着满意的光芒。

‘Ah!’ he said. ‘Splendid! A set of jackasses!’
“啊！”他说。 '灿烂！一群蠢货！’

‘I could have KILLED them!’ she cried in passion. ‘DOGS!—they are dogs! Why is Rupert such a FOOL as to write such letters to them? Why does he give himself away to such canaille? It’s a thing that CANNOT BE BORNE.’
“我本可以杀了他们！”她激动地喊道。 “狗！——他们是狗！”为什么鲁珀特这么傻，给他们写这样的信？他为什么要向这样的贱人出卖自己呢？这是一件无法承受的事情。

Gerald wondered over her strange passion.
杰拉德对她奇怪的热情感到好奇。

And she could not rest any longer in London. They must go by the morning train from Charing Cross. As they drew over the bridge, in the train, having glimpses of the river between the great iron girders, she cried:
她在伦敦不能再休息了。他们必须乘早班火车从查令十字车站出发。当他们在火车上驶过桥时，瞥见巨大铁梁之间的河流，她喊道：

‘I feel I could NEVER see this foul town again—I couldn’t BEAR to come back to it.’
“我觉得我再也见不到这个肮脏的小镇了——我无法忍受回到它。”

CHAPTER XXIX
第二十九章

CONTINENTAL
大陆集团

Ursula went on in an unreal suspense, the last weeks before going away. She was not herself,—she was not anything. She was something that is going to be—soon—soon—very soon. But as yet, she was only imminent.
离开前的最后几周，乌苏拉一直处于一种不真实的悬念中。她不再是她自己——她什么都不是。她将会——很快——很快——很快就会成为这样的人。但到目前为止，她只是迫在眉睫。

She went to see her parents. It was a rather stiff, sad meeting, more like a verification of separateness than a reunion. But they were all vague and indefinite with one another, stiffened in the fate that moved them apart.
她去看望她的父母。这是一次相当僵硬、悲伤的会面，更像是一次分离的验证，而不是一次重聚。但他们彼此之间都是模糊的、不确定的，在命运的驱使下他们变得僵硬。

She did not really come to until she was on the ship crossing from Dover to Ostend. Dimly she had come down to London with Birkin, London had been a vagueness, so had the train-journey to Dover. It was all like a sleep.
直到她登上从多佛前往奥斯坦德的轮船时，她才真正苏醒过来。朦胧中，她带着柏金包来到了伦敦，伦敦一直是个模糊的东西，去多佛的火车之旅也是如此。一切就像是睡着了一样。

And now, at last, as she stood in the stern of the ship, in a pitch-dark, rather blowy night, feeling the motion of the sea, and watching the small, rather desolate little lights that twinkled on the shores of England, as on the shores of nowhere, watched them sinking smaller and smaller on the profound and living darkness, she felt her soul stirring to awake from its anaesthetic sleep.
现在，最后，当她站在船尾，在漆黑、风大的夜晚，感受着大海的波动，看着英格兰海岸上闪烁的细小、相当荒凉的灯光时，就像在不知何处的海岸上一样，看着它们在深邃而生机勃勃的黑暗中越来越小，她感到自己的灵魂从麻醉的睡眠中苏醒。

‘Let us go forward, shall we?’ said Birkin. He wanted to be at the tip of their projection. So they left off looking at the faint sparks that glimmered out of nowhere, in the far distance, called England, and turned their faces to the unfathomed night in front.
“让我们继续前进，好吗？”伯金说。他想成为他们预测的顶端。于是，他们不再看远处不知从哪里冒出来的微弱火花，那叫作“英格兰”，转过脸去望向前方深不可测的夜色。

They went right to the bows of the softly plunging vessel. In the complete obscurity, Birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook, where a great rope was coiled up. It was quite near the very point of the ship, near the black, unpierced space ahead. There they sat down, folded together, folded round with the same rug, creeping in nearer and ever nearer to one another, till it seemed they had crept right into each other, and become one substance. It was very cold, and the darkness was palpable.
他们径直走到轻轻下沉的船的船头。在完全黑暗中，伯金找到了一个相对隐蔽的角落，那里盘着一根粗绳子。它非常靠近船的最顶端，靠近前方黑色的、未穿透的空间。他们坐在那里，折叠在一起，用同一张地毯折叠起来，彼此爬得越来越近，直到看起来他们已经爬到了彼此身上，变成了一种物质。天气非常寒冷，黑暗触手可及。

One of the ship’s crew came along the deck, dark as the darkness, not really visible. They then made out the faintest pallor of his face. He felt their presence, and stopped, unsure—then bent forward. When his face was near them, he saw the faint pallor of their faces. Then he withdrew like a phantom. And they watched him without making any sound.
一名船员沿着甲板走来，漆黑如夜，根本看不见。然后他们看出他脸上有一丝苍白。他感觉到他们的存在，然后停了下来，不确定——然后向前弯下身子。当他的脸靠近他们时，他看到他们的脸色有些苍白。然后他就如幻影一般退了出去。他们看着他，没有发出任何声音。

They seemed to fall away into the profound darkness. There was no sky, no earth, only one unbroken darkness, into which, with a soft, sleeping motion, they seemed to fall like one closed seed of life falling through dark, fathomless space.
他们似乎陷入了深深的黑暗之中。没有天空，没有大地，只有一片连绵不断的黑暗，他们以一种轻柔的、沉睡的动作，坠入其中，就像一粒闭合的生命种子坠入黑暗、深不可测的空间。

They had forgotten where they were, forgotten all that was and all that had been, conscious only in their heart, and there conscious only of this pure trajectory through the surpassing darkness. The ship’s prow cleaved on, with a faint noise of cleavage, into the complete night, without knowing, without seeing, only surging on.
他们忘记了自己身在何处，忘记了过去和现在的一切，只在心中意识到，只意识到这条穿过超越黑暗的纯粹轨迹。船头劈开，伴随着微弱的劈裂声，进入整个黑夜，不知不觉，看不见，只是汹涌而行。

In Ursula the sense of the unrealised world ahead triumphed over everything. In the midst of this profound darkness, there seemed to glow on her heart the effulgence of a paradise unknown and unrealised. Her heart was full of the most wonderful light, golden like honey of darkness, sweet like the warmth of day, a light which was not shed on the world, only on the unknown paradise towards which she was going, a sweetness of habitation, a delight of living quite unknown, but hers infallibly. In her transport she lifted her face suddenly to him, and he touched it with his lips. So cold, so fresh, so sea-clear her face was, it was like kissing a flower that grows near the surf.
在乌苏拉看来，前方未实现的世界的感觉战胜了一切。在这片深邃的黑暗之中，她的心似乎闪烁着未知和未实现的天堂的光芒。她的心里充满了最美妙的光芒，金色的像黑暗中的蜂蜜，甜蜜像白昼的温暖，这种光不照射在世界上，只照射在她要去的未知的天堂上，一种居住的甜蜜，一种幸福的感觉。生活的乐趣无人知晓，但她的乐趣却是绝对正确的。在她的兴奋中，她突然抬起脸来面对他，他用嘴唇碰了碰它。她的脸是如此冰冷，如此清新，如此清澈，就像亲吻一朵生长在海浪附近的花朵。

But he did not know the ecstasy of bliss in fore-knowledge that she knew. To him, the wonder of this transit was overwhelming. He was falling through a gulf of infinite darkness, like a meteorite plunging across the chasm between the worlds. The world was torn in two, and he was plunging like an unlit star through the ineffable rift. What was beyond was not yet for him. He was overcome by the trajectory.
但他不知道她所知道的预知中的幸福狂喜。对他来说，这次转变的奇迹是压倒性的。他正坠入无尽黑暗的深渊，就像一颗陨石坠入了世界之间的鸿沟。世界被撕成两半，他像一颗熄灭的星星一样坠入不可言喻的裂痕。未来的事对他来说还没有到来。他被轨迹征服了。

In a trance he lay enfolding Ursula round about. His face was against her fine, fragile hair, he breathed its fragrance with the sea and the profound night. And his soul was at peace; yielded, as he fell into the unknown. This was the first time that an utter and absolute peace had entered his heart, now, in this final transit out of life.
他躺在床上，把乌苏拉搂在怀里，神情恍惚。他的脸贴着她纤细脆弱的头发，呼吸着大海和深邃夜色的芬芳。他的灵魂得到了平静；当他陷入未知时，他屈服了。这是第一次，在他生命的最后过渡中，彻底、绝对的平静进入他的内心。

When there came some stir on the deck, they roused. They stood up. How stiff and cramped they were, in the night-time! And yet the paradisal glow on her heart, and the unutterable peace of darkness in his, this was the all-in-all.
当甲板上传来一些骚动时，他们惊醒了。他们站了起来。在夜间，他们是多么僵硬和狭窄啊！然而，她心中天堂般的光芒，以及他心中难以言表的黑暗平静，这就是一切。

They stood up and looked ahead. Low lights were seen down the darkness. This was the world again. It was not the bliss of her heart, nor the peace of his. It was the superficial unreal world of fact. Yet not quite the old world. For the peace and the bliss in their hearts was enduring.
他们站起来，看着前方。黑暗中可以看到微弱的灯光。这又是世界了。这不是她内心的幸福，也不是他内心的平静。这是表面上不真实的事实世界。但还不完全是旧世界。因为他们心中的平安和幸福是持久的。

Strange, and desolate above all things, like disembarking from the Styx into the desolated underworld, was this landing at night. There was the raw, half-lighted, covered-in vastness of the dark place, boarded and hollow underfoot, with only desolation everywhere. Ursula had caught sight of the big, pallid, mystic letters ‘OSTEND,’ standing in the darkness. Everybody was hurrying with a blind, insect-like intentness through the dark grey air, porters were calling in un-English English, then trotting with heavy bags, their colourless blouses looking ghostly as they disappeared; Ursula stood at a long, low, zinc-covered barrier, along with hundreds of other spectral people, and all the way down the vast, raw darkness was this low stretch of open bags and spectral people, whilst, on the other side of the barrier, pallid officials in peaked caps and moustaches were turning the underclothing in the bags, then scrawling a chalk-mark.
这次登陆是在夜间，奇怪而荒凉，就像从冥河登陆到荒凉的地下世界一样。那里是原始的、半明半暗的、广阔无垠的黑暗之地，脚下是木板和空洞的，到处都是荒凉。乌苏拉看到了黑暗中矗立着的巨大、苍白、神秘的字母“奥斯坦德”。每个人都像昆虫一样全神贯注地在深灰色的空气中匆匆忙忙，搬运工用非英语的英语呼唤着，然后背着沉重的袋子小跑着，他们的无色衬衫消失时看起来像幽灵一样；乌苏拉和数百名其他幽灵人一起站在一道长长的、低矮的、锌覆盖的屏障上，一路走下去，在广阔、原始的黑暗中，就是这片低矮的打开的袋子和幽灵人，而在障碍物的另一边屏障外，戴着鸭舌帽、留着小胡子、脸色苍白的官员正在翻动袋子里的内衣，然后用粉笔画了一个记号。

It was done. Birkin snapped the hand bags, off they went, the porter coming behind. They were through a great doorway, and in the open night again—ah, a railway platform! Voices were still calling in inhuman agitation through the dark-grey air, spectres were running along the darkness between the train.
事情完成了。伯金折断手提包，他们就出发了，搬运工跟在后面。他们穿过一扇大门，又进入了空旷的夜色——啊，一个火车站台！深灰色的空气中仍然传来非人的激动的呼唤声，幽灵在火车之间的黑暗中奔跑。

‘Koln—Berlin—‘ Ursula made out on the boards hung on the high train on one side.
“科隆——柏林——”乌苏拉在挂在高车一侧的木板上辨认出来。

‘Here we are,’ said Birkin. And on her side she saw: ‘Elsass—Lothringen—Luxembourg, Metz—Basle.’
“我们到了，”伯金说。在她这边，她看到：“埃尔萨斯——洛特林根——卢森堡，梅斯——巴塞尔。”

‘That was it, Basle!’
“就是这样，巴塞尔！”

The porter came up.
搬运工走了过来。

‘A Bale—deuxieme classe?—Voila!’ And he clambered into the high train. They followed. The compartments were already some of them taken. But many were dim and empty. The luggage was stowed, the porter was tipped.
“贝尔——deuxieme classe？——瞧！”他爬上了高铁。他们遵循。其中一些隔间已经被占用了。但许多地方都是昏暗而空荡荡的。行李已经放好了，搬运工也给了小费。

‘Nous avons encore—?’ said Birkin, looking at his watch and at the porter.
“Nous avons encore——？”伯金一边说，一边看了看手表，又看了看门房。

‘Encore une demi-heure.’ With which, in his blue blouse, he disappeared. He was ugly and insolent.
“再来一次。”​​说完，他穿着蓝色衬衫就消失了。他丑陋无礼。

‘Come,’ said Birkin. ‘It is cold. Let us eat.’
“来吧，”伯金说。 '很冷。我们吃吧。'

There was a coffee-wagon on the platform. They drank hot, watery coffee, and ate the long rolls, split, with ham between, which were such a wide bite that it almost dislocated Ursula’s jaw; and they walked beside the high trains. It was all so strange, so extremely desolate, like the underworld, grey, grey, dirt grey, desolate, forlorn, nowhere—grey, dreary nowhere.
站台上停着一辆咖啡车。他们喝着热腾腾的咖啡，吃着切开的长面包卷，中间夹着火腿，一口咬下去，乌苏拉的下巴几乎脱臼了。他们走在高高的火车旁边。一切都是那么奇怪，那么荒凉，就像地狱一样，灰色，灰色，土灰色，荒凉，荒凉，无处可去——灰色，无处可寻。

At last they were moving through the night. In the darkness Ursula made out the flat fields, the wet flat dreary darkness of the Continent. They pulled up surprisingly soon—Bruges! Then on through the level darkness, with glimpses of sleeping farms and thin poplar trees and deserted high-roads. She sat dismayed, hand in hand with Birkin. He pale, immobile like a REVENANT himself, looked sometimes out of the window, sometimes closed his eyes. Then his eyes opened again, dark as the darkness outside.
他们终于在夜间移动了。乌苏拉在黑暗中辨认出平坦的田野，这是大陆潮湿、平坦、阴沉的黑暗。他们很快就停了下来——布鲁日！然后穿过平坦的黑暗，瞥见沉睡的农场、稀疏的白杨树和荒芜的公路。她沮丧地坐着，与伯金手拉手。他脸色苍白，一动不动，就像一个亡魂一样，有时看着窗外，有时闭上眼睛。然后他的眼睛再次睁开，漆黑如外面的黑暗。

A flash of a few lights on the darkness—Ghent station! A few more spectres moving outside on the platform—then the bell—then motion again through the level darkness. Ursula saw a man with a lantern come out of a farm by the railway, and cross to the dark farm-buildings. She thought of the Marsh, the old, intimate farm-life at Cossethay. My God, how far was she projected from her childhood, how far was she still to go! In one life-time one travelled through aeons. The great chasm of memory from her childhood in the intimate country surroundings of Cossethay and the Marsh Farm—she remembered the servant Tilly, who used to give her bread and butter sprinkled with brown sugar, in the old living-room where the grandfather clock had two pink roses in a basket painted above the figures on the face—and now when she was travelling into the unknown with Birkin, an utter stranger—was so great, that it seemed she had no identity, that the child she had been, playing in Cossethay churchyard, was a little creature of history, not really herself.
黑暗中闪过几道灯光——根特车站！又有几个幽灵在平台上移动——然后是铃声——然后再次穿过平坦的黑暗。乌苏拉看到一个提着灯笼的男人从铁路旁的农场里出来，穿过黑暗的农舍。她想起了沼泽地，想起了科塞赛古老而亲密的农场生活。天哪，她离童年还有多远，她还要走多远！人的一生，经历了无数劫。她童年时在科塞赛和沼泽农场温馨的乡村环境中度过的记忆中的巨大鸿沟——她记得仆人蒂莉，她常常在古老的客厅里给她面包和撒上红糖的黄油，那里有落地大钟。篮子里的两朵粉红玫瑰画在脸上的人物上方——现在，当她和完全陌生的伯金一起进入未知的世界时——是如此伟大，以至于她似乎没有身份，她曾经是个孩子，在玩耍在科塞赛教堂墓地里，她是历史的一个小人物，而不是她自己。

They were at Brussels—half an hour for breakfast. They got down. On the great station clock it said six o’clock. They had coffee and rolls and honey in the vast desert refreshment room, so dreary, always so dreary, dirty, so spacious, such desolation of space. But she washed her face and hands in hot water, and combed her hair—that was a blessing.
他们在布鲁塞尔——吃早餐需要半个小时。他们下来了。车站大钟上显示六点钟。他们在广阔的沙漠茶点室里喝咖啡、面包卷和蜂蜜，那么沉闷，总是那么沉闷、肮脏，那么宽敞，那么荒凉的空间。但她用热水洗了脸和手，并梳理了头发——这是一件幸事。

Soon they were in the train again and moving on. The greyness of dawn began. There were several people in the compartment, large florid Belgian business-men with long brown beards, talking incessantly in an ugly French she was too tired to follow.
很快，他们又坐上了火车，继续前行。黎明的灰色开始了。车厢里有几个人，都是身材高大、脸色红润、留着长长的棕色胡须的比利时商人，他们用难听的法语不停地说话，她太累了，听不懂。

It seemed the train ran by degrees out of the darkness into a faint light, then beat after beat into the day. Ah, how weary it was! Faintly, the trees showed, like shadows. Then a house, white, had a curious distinctness. How was it? Then she saw a village—there were always houses passing.
火车似乎一点一点地从黑暗中驶出，进入微弱的灯光，然后一次又一次地驶入白昼。啊，真是太累了！隐隐约约地，树木显露出来，像影子一样。然后是一座白色的房子，有一种奇怪的独特性。它怎么样？然后她看到了一个村庄——总是有房子经过。

This was an old world she was still journeying through, winter-heavy and dreary. There was plough-land and pasture, and copses of bare trees, copses of bushes, and homesteads naked and work-bare. No new earth had come to pass.
这是一个她仍在穿越的旧世界，寒冷而沉闷。这里有耕地和牧场，还有光秃秃的树林、灌木丛和光秃秃的农田。没有新地球出现。

She looked at Birkin’s face. It was white and still and eternal, too eternal. She linked her fingers imploringly in his, under the cover of her rug. His fingers responded, his eyes looked back at her. How dark, like a night, his eyes were, like another world beyond! Oh, if he were the world as well, if only the world were he! If only he could call a world into being, that should be their own world!
她看着伯金的脸。它是白色的，静止的，​​永恒的，太永恒了。她在地毯下面恳求地将手指与他的手指相扣。他的手指回应了，他的眼睛回望着她。他的眼睛多么漆黑，就像黑夜一样，就像另一个世界！哦，如果他也是世界，如果世界就是他就好了！如果他能创造一个世界就好了，那应该是他们自己的世界！

The Belgians left, the train ran on, through Luxembourg, through Alsace-Lorraine, through Metz. But she was blind, she could see no more. Her soul did not look out.
比利时人离开后，火车继续前行，穿过卢森堡，穿过阿尔萨斯-洛林，穿过梅斯。但她双目失明，什么也看不见了。她的灵魂没有向外看。

They came at last to Basle, to the hotel. It was all a drifting trance, from which she never came to. They went out in the morning, before the train departed. She saw the street, the river, she stood on the bridge. But it all meant nothing. She remembered some shops—one full of pictures, one with orange velvet and ermine. But what did these signify?—nothing.
他们终于来到了巴塞尔，来到了旅馆。这一切都是一种飘忽不定的恍惚状态，她从未从这种状态中清醒过来。他们早上在火车出发前就出去了。她看到了街道、河流，她站在桥上。但这一切都没有任何意义。她记得一些商店——一家挂满了照片，一家有橙色天鹅绒和貂皮。但这些意味着什么？——什么也没有。

She was not at ease till they were in the train again. Then she was relieved. So long as they were moving onwards, she was satisfied. They came to Zurich, then, before very long, ran under the mountains, that were deep in snow. At last she was drawing near. This was the other world now.
直到他们再次坐上火车，她才放心。然后她就释然了。只要他们继续前进，她就满足了。他们来到苏黎世，不久就跑到了积雪很深的山下。她终于走近了。现在这是另一个世界了。

Innsbruck was wonderful, deep in snow, and evening. They drove in an open sledge over the snow: the train had been so hot and stifling. And the hotel, with the golden light glowing under the porch, seemed like a home.
因斯布鲁克非常棒，积雪厚重，而且是傍晚。他们乘坐敞篷雪橇在雪地里行驶：火车里又热又闷。酒店的门廊下闪烁着金色的光芒，看起来就像一个家。

They laughed with pleasure when they were in the hall. The place seemed full and busy.
当他们来到大厅时，他们开心地笑了。这个地方看起来很拥挤而且很忙碌。

‘Do you know if Mr and Mrs Crich—English—from Paris, have arrived?’ Birkin asked in German.
“你知道来自巴黎的英国人克里奇先生和夫人是否已经抵达吗？”伯金用德语问道。

The porter reflected a moment, and was just going to answer, when Ursula caught sight of Gudrun sauntering down the stairs, wearing her dark glossy coat, with grey fur.
搬运工想了想，正要回答，乌苏拉看见古德伦穿着她那件灰色毛皮的深色光泽外套，慢悠悠地走下楼梯。

‘Gudrun! Gudrun!’ she called, waving up the well of the staircase. ‘Shu-hu!’
‘古德伦！古德伦！”她一边喊一边向上楼梯口挥手。 “舒呼！”

Gudrun looked over the rail, and immediately lost her sauntering, diffident air. Her eyes flashed.
古德伦向栏杆上方望去，立刻失去了之前那副闲庭信步、羞怯的神情。她的眼睛闪闪发光。

‘Really—Ursula!’ she cried. And she began to move downstairs as Ursula ran up. They met at a turn and kissed with laughter and exclamations inarticulate and stirring.
“真的——乌苏拉！”她喊道。当乌苏拉跑上楼时，她开始下楼。他们轮流相遇，接吻时带着笑声和感叹，语无伦次，激动人心。

‘But!’ cried Gudrun, mortified. ‘We thought it was TOMORROW you were coming! I wanted to come to the station.’
“但是！”古德伦羞愧地喊道。 “我们以为你明天就会来！”我想去车站。

‘No, we’ve come today!’ cried Ursula. ‘Isn’t it lovely here!’
“不，我们今天来了！”乌苏拉喊道。 “这里不是很可爱吗！”

‘Adorable!’ said Gudrun. ‘Gerald’s just gone out to get something. Ursula, aren’t you FEARFULLY tired?’
“可爱极了！”古德伦说。 “杰拉德刚刚出去拿东西。乌苏拉，你不累吗？

‘No, not so very. But I look a filthy sight, don’t I!’
” “不，不太好。但我看起来很肮脏，不是吗！”

‘No, you don’t. You look almost perfectly fresh. I like that fur cap IMMENSELY!’ She glanced over Ursula, who wore a big soft coat with a collar of deep, soft, blond fur, and a soft blond cap of fur.
‘不，你不知道。你看起来几乎非常新鲜。我非常喜欢那顶毛皮帽！”她看了一眼乌苏拉，乌苏拉穿着一件柔软的大衣，领子是深、柔软、金色的毛皮，还有一顶柔软的金色毛皮帽。

‘And you!’ cried Ursula. ‘What do you think YOU look like!’
“还有你！”乌苏拉喊道。 “你觉得你是什么样子！”

Gudrun assumed an unconcerned, expressionless face.
古德伦摆出一张漠不关心、面无表情的脸。

‘Do you like it?’ she said.
“你喜欢吗？”她说。

‘It’s VERY fine!’ cried Ursula, perhaps with a touch of satire.
“很好！”乌苏拉喊道，语气中或许带着一丝讽刺。

‘Go up—or come down,’ said Birkin. For there the sisters stood, Gudrun with her hand on Ursula’s arm, on the turn of the stairs half way to the first landing, blocking the way and affording full entertainment to the whole of the hall below, from the door porter to the plump Jew in black clothes.
“要么上去，要么下来，”伯金说。因为姐妹们就站在那里，古德伦把手放在乌苏拉的手臂上，在通往第一个平台的楼梯拐角处，挡住了去路，为下面的整个大厅提供了充分的娱乐，从门房到胖乎乎的犹太人穿着黑色衣服。

The two young women slowly mounted, followed by Birkin and the waiter.
两个年轻女子慢慢上马，伯金和服务员跟在后面。

‘First floor?’ asked Gudrun, looking back over her shoulder.
“一楼？”古珍回头问道。

‘Second Madam—the lift!’ the waiter replied. And he darted to the elevator to forestall the two women. But they ignored him, as, chattering without heed, they set to mount the second flight. Rather chagrined, the waiter followed.
“二夫人——电梯！”服务员回答道。他冲向电梯，抢先阻止了那两个女人。但他们无视了他，漫不经心地喋喋不休，开始登上第二架飞机。服务员有些懊恼地跟了上去。

It was curious, the delight of the sisters in each other, at this meeting. It was as if they met in exile, and united their solitary forces against all the world. Birkin looked on with some mistrust and wonder.
奇怪的是，在这次聚会上，姐妹们彼此都感到高兴。就好像他们在流亡中相遇，并联合他们孤独的力量对抗整个世界。伯金带着一些不信任和惊奇看着。

When they had bathed and changed, Gerald came in. He looked shining like the sun on frost.
他们洗完澡换衣服后，杰拉尔德进来了。他看上去就像霜冻上的太阳一样闪闪发光。

‘Go with Gerald and smoke,’ said Ursula to Birkin. ‘Gudrun and I want to talk.’
“和杰拉尔德一起去抽烟吧，”乌苏拉对伯金说。 “古德伦和我想谈谈。”

Then the sisters sat in Gudrun’s bedroom, and talked clothes, and experiences. Gudrun told Ursula the experience of the Birkin letter in the cafe. Ursula was shocked and frightened.
然后姐妹们坐在古德伦的卧室里，谈论衣服和经历。古德伦在咖啡馆里向乌苏拉讲述了柏金信的经历。乌苏拉感到震惊和害怕。

‘Where is the letter?’ she asked.
“信在哪里？”她问。

‘I kept it,’ said Gudrun.
“我保留了它，”古德伦说。

‘You’ll give it me, won’t you?’ she said.
“你会把它给我，不是吗？”她说。

But Gudrun was silent for some moments, before she replied:
但古珍沉默了一会儿，才回答道：

‘Do you really want it, Ursula?’
“你真的想要它吗，乌苏拉？”

‘I want to read it,’ said Ursula.
“我想读它，”乌苏拉说。

‘Certainly,’ said Gudrun.
“当然，”古德伦说。

Even now, she could not admit, to Ursula, that she wanted to keep it, as a memento, or a symbol. But Ursula knew, and was not pleased. So the subject was switched off.
即使现在，她也无法向乌苏拉承认她想保留它，作为纪念品或象征。但乌苏拉知道了，并且不高兴。于是话题就被岔开了。

‘What did you do in Paris?’ asked Ursula.
“你在巴黎做什么？”乌苏拉问。

‘Oh,’ said Gudrun laconically—‘the usual things. We had a FINE party one night in Fanny Bath’s studio.’
“哦，”古德伦简洁地说——“平常的事情。”一天晚上，我们在范妮·巴斯的工作室举办了一场精彩的派对。

‘Did you? And you and Gerald were there! Who else? Tell me about it.’
'你是否？你和杰拉德也在场！还有谁？告诉我怎么回事儿。'

‘Well,’ said Gudrun. ‘There’s nothing particular to tell. You know Fanny is FRIGHTFULLY in love with that painter, Billy Macfarlane. He was there—so Fanny spared nothing, she spent VERY freely. It was really remarkable! Of course, everybody got fearfully drunk—but in an interesting way, not like that filthy London crowd. The fact is these were all people that matter, which makes all the difference. There was a Roumanian, a fine chap. He got completely drunk, and climbed to the top of a high studio ladder, and gave the most marvellous address—really, Ursula, it was wonderful! He began in French—La vie, c’est une affaire d’ames imperiales—in a most beautiful voice—he was a fine-looking chap—but he had got into Roumanian before he had finished, and not a soul understood. But Donald Gilchrist was worked to a frenzy. He dashed his glass to the ground, and declared, by God, he was glad he had been born, by God, it was a miracle to be alive. And do you know, Ursula, so it was—‘ Gudrun laughed rather hollowly.
“好吧，”古德伦说。 ‘没什么特别要说的。你知道范妮非常爱那个画家比利·麦克法兰。他在那里——所以范妮不遗余力，花钱得很随意。真是太了不起了！当然，每个人都喝得酩酊大醉，但方式很有趣，不像伦敦那些肮脏的人群。事实上，这些人都是重要的人，这使得一切变得不同。有一个罗马尼亚人，一个很好的小伙子。他喝得酩酊大醉，爬到工作室高梯的顶端，发表了最精彩的演讲——真的，乌苏拉，太棒了！他用法语开始——La vie, c’est une thinge d’ames Imperiales——声音非常优美——他是个英俊的小伙子——但在他说完之前，他就用罗马尼亚语开始了，没有人听懂。但唐纳德·吉尔克里斯特却忙得不可开交。他把玻璃杯摔到地上，并宣称，上帝啊，他很高兴自己出生了，上帝啊，活着真是一个奇迹。你知道吗，乌苏拉，事情就是这样——”古德伦空洞地笑道。

‘But how was Gerald among them all?’ asked Ursula.
“但是杰拉德在他们当中怎么样呢？”乌苏拉问道。

‘Gerald! Oh, my word, he came out like a dandelion in the sun! HE’S a whole saturnalia in himself, once he is roused. I shouldn’t like to say whose waist his arm did not go round. Really, Ursula, he seems to reap the women like a harvest. There wasn’t one that would have resisted him. It was too amazing! Can you understand it?’
杰拉德！哦，我的天，他出来就像阳光下的蒲公英！一旦他被唤醒，他自己就是一个完整的农神节。我不想说他的手臂没有绕过谁的腰。真的，乌苏拉，他似乎像收割庄稼一样收割女人。没有人会反抗他。太神奇了！你能明白吗？'

Ursula reflected, and a dancing light came into her eyes.
乌苏拉沉思起来，眼中闪现出舞动的光芒。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘I can. He is such a whole-hogger.’
“是的，”她说。 '我可以。他真是个十足的人。

‘Whole-hogger! I should think so!’ exclaimed Gudrun. ‘But it is true, Ursula, every woman in the room was ready to surrender to him. Chanticleer isn’t in it—even Fanny Bath, who is GENUINELY in love with Billy Macfarlane! I never was more amazed in my life! And you know, afterwards—I felt I was a whole ROOMFUL of women. I was no more myself to him, than I was Queen Victoria. I was a whole roomful of women at once. It was most astounding! But my eye, I’d caught a Sultan that time—‘
'全食！我应该这么认为！”古德伦惊呼道。 “但这是真的，乌苏拉，房间里的每个女人都准备向他投降。香蒂克利尔不在其中，甚至连真心爱着比利·麦克法兰的范妮·巴斯也不在其中！我一生中从未如此惊讶过！你知道，后来我觉得我是一屋子的女人。对他来说，我不再是我自己，就像我不再是维多利亚女王一样。我一下子就挤满了一屋子的女人。这是最令人震惊的！但我的眼睛，那次我看到了一位苏丹——”

Gudrun’s eyes were flashing, her cheek was hot, she looked strange, exotic, satiric. Ursula was fascinated at once—and yet uneasy.
古德伦的眼睛闪闪发亮，她的脸颊滚烫，她看起来很奇怪，充满异国情调，充满讽刺。乌苏拉立即着迷了——但又感到不安。

They had to get ready for dinner. Gudrun came down in a daring gown of vivid green silk and tissue of gold, with green velvet bodice and a strange black-and-white band round her hair. She was really brilliantly beautiful and everybody noticed her. Gerald was in that full-blooded, gleaming state when he was most handsome. Birkin watched them with quick, laughing, half-sinister eyes, Ursula quite lost her head. There seemed a spell, almost a blinding spell, cast round their table, as if they were lighted up more strongly than the rest of the dining-room.
他们必须准备吃晚饭。古德伦穿着一件大胆的礼服，由鲜艳的绿色丝绸和金色薄纱制成，搭配绿色天鹅绒紧身胸衣，头发上绕着一条奇怪的黑白带子。她真的非常漂亮，每个人都注意到她。杰拉德在他最英俊的时候，正处于那种血气方刚、光芒四射的状态。伯金用快活的、带笑的、半阴险的眼神看着他们，乌苏拉完全失去了理智。他们的桌子周围似乎有一种咒语，几乎是一种令人目眩的咒语，好像他们的灯光比餐厅的其他地方更亮。

‘Don’t you love to be in this place?’ cried Gudrun. ‘Isn’t the snow wonderful! Do you notice how it exalts everything? It is simply marvellous. One really does feel LIBERMENSCHLICH—more than human.’
“你不喜欢呆在这个地方吗？”古德伦喊道。 ‘雪不是很好吗！你注意到它如何提升一切了吗？这简直太棒了。人们确实感受到了自由——超越了人类。

‘One does,’ cried Ursula. ‘But isn’t that partly the being out of England?’
“有一个，”乌苏拉喊道。 “但这不就是离开英格兰的部分原因吗？”

‘Oh, of course,’ cried Gudrun. ‘One could never feel like this in England, for the simple reason that the damper is NEVER lifted off one, there. It is quite impossible really to let go, in England, of that I am assured.’
“哦，当然，”古德伦喊道。 “在英格兰，人们永远不会有这样的感觉，原因很简单，那里的阻尼器永远不会被抬起。我确信，在英格兰，真正放手是不可能的。

And she turned again to the food she was eating. She was fluttering with vivid intensity.
她再次转向正在吃的食物。她剧烈地颤动着。

‘It’s quite true,’ said Gerald, ‘it never is quite the same in England. But perhaps we don’t want it to be—perhaps it’s like bringing the light a little too near the powder-magazine, to let go altogether, in England. One is afraid what might happen, if EVERYBODY ELSE let go.’
“确实如此，”杰拉尔德说，“英格兰的情况从来都不是一样的。”但也许我们不希望这样——也许这就像在英国把光线太靠近火药库一样，以至于无法完全放开。人们担心如果其他人都放手的话可能会发生什么。

‘My God!’ cried Gudrun. ‘But wouldn’t it be wonderful, if all England did suddenly go off like a display of fireworks.’
“天啊！”古德伦喊道。 “但是，如果整个英格兰突然像烟花表演一样消失，那不是很棒吗？”

‘It couldn’t,’ said Ursula. ‘They are all too damp, the powder is damp in them.’
“不可能，”乌苏拉说。 “它们都太湿了，里面的粉末都湿了。”

‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said Gerald.
“我不太确定，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Nor I,’ said Birkin. ‘When the English really begin to go off, EN MASSE, it’ll be time to shut your ears and run.’
“我也没有，”伯金说。 “当英国人真正开始发怒时，全体人民，就该闭上耳朵逃跑了。”

‘They never will,’ said Ursula.
“他们永远不会，”乌苏拉说。

‘We’ll see,’ he replied.
“我们拭目以待，”他回答道。

‘Isn’t it marvellous,’ said Gudrun, ‘how thankful one can be, to be out of one’s country. I cannot believe myself, I am so transported, the moment I set foot on a foreign shore. I say to myself ‘Here steps a new creature into life.‘‘
“这不是很棒吗？”古德伦说，“一个人能够离开自己的国家是多么感激。我简直不敢相信自己，当我踏上异国海岸的那一刻，我是如此激动。我对自己说：“一个新的生命即将诞生。”

‘Don’t be too hard on poor old England,’ said Gerald. ‘Though we curse it, we love it really.’
“不要对可怜的古老英格兰太严厉，”杰拉德说。 “虽然我们诅咒它，但我们真的很喜欢它。”

To Ursula, there seemed a fund of cynicism in these words.
在乌苏拉看来，这些话里似乎充满了愤世嫉俗的意味。

‘We may,’ said Birkin. ‘But it’s a damnably uncomfortable love: like a love for an aged parent who suffers horribly from a complication of diseases, for which there is no hope.’
“我们可以，”伯金说。 “但这是一种极其不舒服的爱：就像对一位年迈父母的爱，他们患有疾病并发症，没有希望。”

Gudrun looked at him with dilated dark eyes.
古德伦用放大的黑眼睛看着他。

‘You think there is no hope?’ she asked, in her pertinent fashion.
“你认为没有希望了吗？”她用她中肯的方式问道。

But Birkin backed away. He would not answer such a question.
但伯金却退缩了。这样的问题他不会回答。

‘Any hope of England’s becoming real? God knows. It’s a great actual unreality now, an aggregation into unreality. It might be real, if there were no Englishmen.’
“英格兰有希望成为现实吗？天知道。现在这是一个巨大的实际不现实，一个不现实的聚合。如果没有英国人的话，这可能是真的。”

‘You think the English will have to disappear?’ persisted Gudrun. It was strange, her pointed interest in his answer. It might have been her own fate she was inquiring after. Her dark, dilated eyes rested on Birkin, as if she could conjure the truth of the future out of him, as out of some instrument of divination.
“你认为英国人必须消失吗？”古德伦坚持问道。奇怪的是，她对他的回答很感兴趣。她所追问的也许就是她自己的命运。她睁大的黑眼睛落在伯金身上，仿佛她能从他身上变出未来的真相，就像从某种占卜工具中变出一样。

He was pale. Then, reluctantly, he answered:
他脸色苍白。然后他无奈地回答道：

‘Well—what else is in front of them, but disappearance? They’ve got to disappear from their own special brand of Englishness, anyhow.’
‘好吧——除了消失之外，他们面前还有什么？无论如何，他们必须从自己独特的英国风格中消失。

Gudrun watched him as if in a hypnotic state, her eyes wide and fixed on him.
戈德伦看着他，仿佛处于催眠状态，她的眼睛睁得大大的，死死地盯着他。

‘But in what way do you mean, disappear?—‘ she persisted.
“但是你说的消失是什么意思？——”她坚持道。

‘Yes, do you mean a change of heart?’ put in Gerald.
“是的，你的意思是改变主意吗？”杰拉德插嘴道。

‘I don’t mean anything, why should I?’ said Birkin. ‘I’m an Englishman, and I’ve paid the price of it. I can’t talk about England—I can only speak for myself.’
“我没有任何意思，我为什么要这么做呢？”伯金说。 “我是一个英国人，我已经为此付出了代价。我不能谈论英格兰——我只能代表我自己。

‘Yes,’ said Gudrun slowly, ‘you love England immensely, IMMENSELY, Rupert.’
“是的，”古德伦慢慢地说，“你非常非常地爱英格兰，鲁珀特。”

‘And leave her,’ he replied.
“然后离开她，”他回答道。

‘No, not for good. You’ll come back,’ said Gerald, nodding sagely.
'不，这不是好事。你会回来的。”杰拉尔德明智地点点头说道。

‘They say the lice crawl off a dying body,’ said Birkin, with a glare of bitterness. ‘So I leave England.’
“他们说虱子会从垂死的尸体上爬出来，”伯金说道，眼神里满是苦涩。 “所以我离开英格兰。”

‘Ah, but you’ll come back,’ said Gudrun, with a sardonic smile.
“啊，但你会回来的，”戈珍说道，脸上带着讽刺的微笑。

‘Tant pis pour moi,’ he replied.
“Tant pis pour moi”，他回答道。

‘Isn’t he angry with his mother country!’ laughed Gerald, amused.
“他不是在生他的祖国的气吗！”杰拉尔德被逗乐了，笑道。

‘Ah, a patriot!’ said Gudrun, with something like a sneer.
“啊，一个爱国者！”古德伦说道，语气里带着一丝冷笑。

Birkin refused to answer any more.
伯金拒绝再回答。

Gudrun watched him still for a few seconds. Then she turned away. It was finished, her spell of divination in him. She felt already purely cynical. She looked at Gerald. He was wonderful like a piece of radium to her. She felt she could consume herself and know ALL, by means of this fatal, living metal. She smiled to herself at her fancy. And what would she do with herself, when she had destroyed herself? For if spirit, if integral being is destructible, Matter is indestructible.
古德伦静静地注视着他几秒钟。然后她转身走开。她对他的占卜咒语结束了。她觉得自己已经完全愤世嫉俗了。她看着杰拉德。他对她来说就像一块镭一样美妙。她觉得她可以通过这种致命的活金属消耗自己并了解一切。她为自己的幻想暗自微笑。当她毁了自己之后，她该怎么办？因为如果精神、整体存在是可毁灭的，那么物质就是不可毁灭的。

He was looking bright and abstracted, puzzled, for the moment. She stretched out her beautiful arm, with its fluff of green tulle, and touched his chin with her subtle, artist’s fingers.
此刻，他看起来很聪明，但心不在焉，困惑不解。她伸出美丽的手臂，手臂上长着绿色的薄纱，用她微妙的、艺术家般的手指碰触他的下巴。

‘What are they then?’ she asked, with a strange, knowing smile.
“那它们是什么？”她问道，带着一种奇怪的、会心的微笑。

‘What?’ he replied, his eyes suddenly dilating with wonder.
“什么？”他回答道，眼睛突然睁大，充满了惊奇。

‘Your thoughts.’
'你的想法。'

Gerald looked like a man coming awake.
杰拉尔德看上去就像一个刚醒来的人。

‘I think I had none,’ he said.
“我想我没有，”他说。

‘Really!’ she said, with grave laughter in her voice.
“真的！”她说，声音里带着严肃的笑声。

And to Birkin it was as if she killed Gerald, with that touch.
对于伯金来说，那种触感就好像她杀死了杰拉德。

‘Ah but,’ cried Gudrun, ‘let us drink to Britannia—let us drink to Britannia.’
“啊，但是，”古德伦喊道，“让我们为不列颠尼亚干杯——让我们为不列颠尼亚干杯。”

It seemed there was wild despair in her voice. Gerald laughed, and filled the glasses.
她的声音里似乎充满了绝望。杰拉尔德笑了，给杯子斟满了酒。

‘I think Rupert means,’ he said, ‘that NATIONALLY all Englishmen must die, so that they can exist individually and—‘
“我认为鲁珀特的意思是，”他说，“全国范围内所有英国人都必须死，这样他们才能单独存在，而且——”

‘Super-nationally—‘ put in Gudrun, with a slight ironic grimace, raising her glass.
“超级国家——”古德伦举起酒杯，脸上带着一丝讽刺的表情，插嘴道。

The next day, they descended at the tiny railway station of Hohenhausen, at the end of the tiny valley railway. It was snow everywhere, a white, perfect cradle of snow, new and frozen, sweeping up an either side, black crags, and white sweeps of silver towards the blue pale heavens.
第二天，他们降落在霍恩豪森小火车站，位于小山谷铁路的尽头。到处都是雪，白色的、完美的雪的摇篮，新的和冰冻的，扫过两边，黑色的峭壁，白色的银色扫向蓝色苍白的天空。

As they stepped out on the naked platform, with only snow around and above, Gudrun shrank as if it chilled her heart.
当他们踏上赤裸裸的平台时，周围和上面都只有雪，古德伦瑟缩了一下，仿佛心都凉了。

‘My God, Jerry,’ she said, turning to Gerald with sudden intimacy, ‘you’ve done it now.’
“天哪，杰瑞，”她突然亲切地转向杰拉德，“你现在已经做到了。”

‘What?’
'什么？'

She made a faint gesture, indicating the world on either hand.
她做了一个微弱的手势，示意着两只手上的世界。

‘Look at it!’
'看它！'

She seemed afraid to go on. He laughed.
她似乎害怕继续下去。他笑了。

They were in the heart of the mountains. From high above, on either side, swept down the white fold of snow, so that one seemed small and tiny in a valley of pure concrete heaven, all strangely radiant and changeless and silent.
他们在山的中心。白色的积雪从两侧高处扫下，使人在纯混凝土天堂的山谷中显得渺小而渺小，一切都奇异地光芒四射，一成不变，寂静无声。

‘It makes one feel so small and alone,’ said Ursula, turning to Birkin and laying her hand on his arm.
“这让人感觉如此渺小和孤独，”乌苏拉说，转向伯金，将手放在他的手臂上。

‘You’re not sorry you’ve come, are you?’ said Gerald to Gudrun.
“你的到来并不后悔，是吗？”杰拉尔德对古德伦说。

She looked doubtful. They went out of the station between banks of snow.
她看上去很怀疑。他们在雪堆之间出了车站。

‘Ah,’ said Gerald, sniffing the air in elation, ‘this is perfect. There’s our sledge. We’ll walk a bit—we’ll run up the road.’
“啊，”杰拉德兴高采烈地嗅着空气，“这太完美了。”这是我们的雪橇。我们会走一点——我们会沿着路跑。

Gudrun, always doubtful, dropped her heavy coat on the sledge, as he did his, and they set off. Suddenly she threw up her head and set off scudding along the road of snow, pulling her cap down over her ears. Her blue, bright dress fluttered in the wind, her thick scarlet stockings were brilliant above the whiteness. Gerald watched her: she seemed to be rushing towards her fate, and leaving him behind. He let her get some distance, then, loosening his limbs, he went after her.
古德伦总是心存疑虑，她像他一样，把厚重的外套放在雪橇上，然后他们就出发了。突然，她抬起头，沿着雪路疾驰而去，把帽子拉下来遮住耳朵。鲜艳的蓝色裙子在风中飘扬，猩红色的厚袜子在白色的衬托下显得格外耀眼。杰拉尔德看着她：她似乎正在冲向自己的命运，而把他抛在了后面。他让她保持一段距离，然后松开四肢，追了上去。

Everywhere was deep and silent snow. Great snow-eaves weighed down the broad-roofed Tyrolese houses, that were sunk to the window-sashes in snow. Peasant-women, full-skirted, wearing each a cross-over shawl, and thick snow-boots, turned in the way to look at the soft, determined girl running with such heavy fleetness from the man, who was overtaking her, but not gaining any power over her.
到处都是厚厚的积雪，寂静无声。巨大的雪檐压垮了宽屋顶的蒂罗尔房屋，这些房屋都被雪沉到了窗框上。穿着长裙、披着交叉披肩、穿着厚厚雪地靴的农妇们在路上转过身来，看着那个温柔而坚定的女孩从那个追上她的男人身边飞快地跑开，但没有获得对她的任何权力。

They passed the inn with its painted shutters and balcony, a few cottages, half buried in the snow; then the snow-buried silent sawmill by the roofed bridge, which crossed the hidden stream, over which they ran into the very depth of the untouched sheets of snow. It was a silence and a sheer whiteness exhilarating to madness. But the perfect silence was most terrifying, isolating the soul, surrounding the heart with frozen air.
他们经过了那家旅馆，旅馆里有彩绘的百叶窗和阳台，还有几间半埋在雪里的小屋。然后是屋顶桥旁被雪掩埋、寂静无声的锯木厂，桥穿过隐藏的小溪，他们越过小溪，跑进了未受破坏的雪层的深处。一片寂静和一片纯粹的白色，令人兴奋到疯狂。但彻底的寂静却是最可怕的，灵魂被隔绝，心脏被冰冷的空气包围。

‘It’s a marvellous place, for all that,’ said Gudrun, looking into his eyes with a strange, meaning look. His soul leapt.
“尽管如此，这还是一个奇妙的地方，”古德伦说，用一种奇怪而意味深长的眼神看着他的眼睛。他的灵魂飞跃。

‘Good,’ he said.
“很好，”他说。

A fierce electric energy seemed to flow over all his limbs, his muscles were surcharged, his hands felt hard with strength. They walked along rapidly up the snow-road, that was marked by withered branches of trees stuck in at intervals. He and she were separate, like opposite poles of one fierce energy. But they felt powerful enough to leap over the confines of life into the forbidden places, and back again.
一股猛烈的电流似乎流过他的四肢，肌肉充沛，双手发硬。他们沿着雪路飞快地走着，路上时不时地插着枯树枝。他和她是分开的，就像一股猛烈能量的两极。但他们感到自己有足够的力量，可以跨越生命的界限，进入禁地，然后再回来。

Birkin and Ursula were running along also, over the snow. He had disposed of the luggage, and they had a little start of the sledges. Ursula was excited and happy, but she kept turning suddenly to catch hold of Birkin’s arm, to make sure of him.
伯金和乌苏拉也在雪地上奔跑。他已经处理掉了行李，他们也稍微启动了雪橇。乌苏拉既兴奋又高兴，但她不断地突然转身抓住伯金的手臂，以确保他的安全。

‘This is something I never expected,’ she said. ‘It is a different world, here.’
“这是我从未预料到的，”她说。 “这里是一个不同的世界。”

They went on into a snow meadow. There they were overtaken by the sledge, that came tinkling through the silence. It was another mile before they came upon Gudrun and Gerald on the steep up-climb, beside the pink, half-buried shrine.
他们继续前行，进入一片雪原。在那里，他们被雪橇追上了，雪橇在寂静中叮当作响。又走了一英里，他们才在陡峭的山坡上遇见了古德伦和杰拉尔德，就在粉红色的半埋神殿旁边。

Then they passed into a gulley, where were walls of black rock and a river filled with snow, and a still blue sky above. Through a covered bridge they went, drumming roughly over the boards, crossing the snow-bed once more, then slowly up and up, the horses walking swiftly, the driver cracking his long whip as he walked beside, and calling his strange wild HUE-HUE!, the walls of rock passing slowly by, till they emerged again between slopes and masses of snow. Up and up, gradually they went, through the cold shadow-radiance of the afternoon, silenced by the imminence of the mountains, the luminous, dazing sides of snow that rose above them and fell away beneath.
然后他们进入了一个沟壑，那里有黑色的岩石墙和一条充满积雪的河流，上面还是一片蔚蓝的天空。他们穿过一座廊桥，粗暴地敲过木板，再次越过雪床，然后慢慢地向上又向上，马匹飞快地走着，车夫在旁边走着，甩动着长鞭，叫着他奇怪的狂野色调——色调！，岩石墙慢慢地经过，直到它们再次出现在斜坡和大雪之间。他们一步步向上，渐渐地穿过午后寒冷的阴影光辉，山势逼近，山上的雪光闪闪发光，令人眼花缭乱，在他们上方升起，在下方消失。

They came forth at last in a little high table-land of snow, where stood the last peaks of snow like the heart petals of an open rose. In the midst of the last deserted valleys of heaven stood a lonely building with brown wooden walls and white heavy roof, deep and deserted in the waste of snow, like a dream. It stood like a rock that had rolled down from the last steep slopes, a rock that had taken the form of a house, and was now half-buried. It was unbelievable that one could live there uncrushed by all this terrible waste of whiteness and silence and clear, upper, ringing cold.
他们终于来到了一片高高的雪台地，那里矗立着最后的雪峰，就像一朵开放的玫瑰花的心花瓣。在最后一片荒凉的天堂山谷中，矗立着一座孤独的建筑，棕色的木墙和白色厚重的屋顶，在荒雪中深邃而荒凉，像一场梦。它矗立着，就像一块从最后陡峭的斜坡上滚下来的岩石，一块变成了房子形状的岩石，现在已经被半埋了。令人难以置信的是，一个人可以住在那里，不受这一切可怕的白色、寂静和清澈、上层、寒冷的浪费的影响。

Yet the sledges ran up in fine style, people came to the door laughing and excited, the floor of the hostel rang hollow, the passage was wet with snow, it was a real, warm interior.
然而雪橇却跑得很漂亮，人们笑着兴奋地来到门口，宿舍的地板空荡荡的，通道被雪打湿了，这是一个真实而温暖的室内。

The new-comers tramped up the bare wooden stairs, following the serving woman. Gudrun and Gerald took the first bedroom. In a moment they found themselves alone in a bare, smallish, close-shut room that was all of golden-coloured wood, floor, walls, ceiling, door, all of the same warm gold panelling of oiled pine. There was a window opposite the door, but low down, because the roof sloped. Under the slope of the ceiling were the table with wash-hand bowl and jug, and across, another table with mirror. On either side the door were two beds piled high with an enormous blue-checked overbolster, enormous.
新来的人跟着女服务员踏上光秃秃的木楼梯。古德伦和杰拉尔德占据了第一间卧室。一会儿，他们发现自己独自一人在一间空荡荡的、狭小的、封闭的房间里，房间里全是金色的木头，地板、墙壁、天花板、门，都是同样温暖的涂油松木的金色镶板。门对面有一扇窗户，但窗户很低，因为屋顶是倾斜的。天花板的斜坡下面是一张桌子，上面放着洗手盆和水壶，对面是另一张桌子，上面有镜子。门的两边各有两张床，高高地堆着一张巨大的蓝色格子垫枕，非常巨大。

This was all—no cupboard, none of the amenities of life. Here they were shut up together in this cell of golden-coloured wood, with two blue checked beds. They looked at each other and laughed, frightened by this naked nearness of isolation.
这就是全部——没有橱柜，没有生活的便利设施。他们被关在这个金色木头的牢房里，里面有两张蓝色格子床。他们互相看着对方，大笑起来，对这种赤裸裸的孤立感感到害怕。

A man knocked and came in with the luggage. He was a sturdy fellow with flattish cheek-bones, rather pale, and with coarse fair moustache. Gudrun watched him put down the bags, in silence, then tramp heavily out.
一个男人敲了敲门，拎着行李进来了。他身材魁梧，颧骨扁平，脸色苍白，留着粗糙而漂亮的小胡子。古德伦默默地看着他放下袋子，然后沉重地走了出去。

‘It isn’t too rough, is it?’ Gerald asked.
“这并不太粗糙，是吗？”杰拉尔德问。

The bedroom was not very warm, and she shivered slightly.
卧室里不太暖和，她微微发抖。

‘It is wonderful,’ she equivocated. ‘Look at the colour of this panelling—it’s wonderful, like being inside a nut.’
“太棒了，”她含糊其辞地说。 “看看这镶板的颜色——太棒了，就像在坚果里一样。”

He was standing watching her, feeling his short-cut moustache, leaning back slightly and watching her with his keen, undaunted eyes, dominated by the constant passion, that was like a doom upon him.
他站在那里看着她，摸着自己剪得很短的小胡子，微微向后靠去，用他那双锐利而无所畏惧的眼睛看着她，那双眼睛被持续不断的激情所支配，这就像厄运降临在他身上。

She went and crouched down in front of the window, curious.
她走到窗前蹲下，一脸好奇。

‘Oh, but this—!’ she cried involuntarily, almost in pain.
“哦，但是这个——！”她不由自主地喊道，几乎是痛苦的。

In front was a valley shut in under the sky, the last huge slopes of snow and black rock, and at the end, like the navel of the earth, a white-folded wall, and two peaks glimmering in the late light. Straight in front ran the cradle of silent snow, between the great slopes that were fringed with a little roughness of pine-trees, like hair, round the base. But the cradle of snow ran on to the eternal closing-in, where the walls of snow and rock rose impenetrable, and the mountain peaks above were in heaven immediate. This was the centre, the knot, the navel of the world, where the earth belonged to the skies, pure, unapproachable, impassable.
前面是一个封闭在天空下的山谷，最后一片巨大的雪坡和黑色的岩石，在尽头，像大地的肚脐一样，有一道白色的墙壁，两座山峰在晚霞中闪闪发光。正前方是寂静的积雪摇篮，在大山坡之间，山坡的山脚周围长满了松树，像头发一样粗糙。但雪的摇篮一直延伸到永恒的封闭，那里的雪墙和岩石高耸得难以逾越，上面的山峰就在天堂里。这里是世界的中心、结点、肚脐，大地属于天空，纯净、不可接近、不可逾越。

It filled Gudrun with a strange rapture. She crouched in front of the window, clenching her face in her hands, in a sort of trance. At last she had arrived, she had reached her place. Here at last she folded her venture and settled down like a crystal in the navel of snow, and was gone.
古德伦心中充满了一种奇怪的狂喜。她蹲在窗前，双手捂着脸，一副恍惚的样子。她终于来了，她到了她该住的地方。在这里，她终于放弃了自己的事业，像雪中的一颗水晶一样安顿下来，然后就消失了。

Gerald bent above her and was looking out over her shoulder. Already he felt he was alone. She was gone. She was completely gone, and there was icy vapour round his heart. He saw the blind valley, the great cul-de-sac of snow and mountain peaks, under the heaven. And there was no way out. The terrible silence and cold and the glamorous whiteness of the dusk wrapped him round, and she remained crouching before the window, as at a shrine, a shadow.
杰拉尔德在她上方弯下腰，越过她的肩膀往外看。他已经感到自己孤身一人了。她走了。她彻底消失了，他的心周围笼罩着冰冷的水汽。他看到了苍穹之下的盲谷、冰雪和山峰的大死胡同。而且没有出路。可怕的寂静、寒冷和黄昏迷人的白色将他包裹着，而她仍然蹲在窗前，就像在一座神殿里，一个影子。

‘Do you like it?’ he asked, in a voice that sounded detached and foreign. At least she might acknowledge he was with her. But she only averted her soft, mute face a little from his gaze. And he knew that there were tears in her eyes, her own tears, tears of her strange religion, that put him to nought.
“你喜欢吗？”他问道，声音听起来超然又陌生。至少她可以承认他和她在一起。但她只是将那张柔软、沉默的脸从他的目光中稍稍移开。他知道她眼里有泪水，她自己的泪水，她奇怪宗教的泪水，这让他变得一无所有。

Quite suddenly, he put his hand under her chin and lifted up her face to him. Her dark blue eyes, in their wetness of tears, dilated as if she was startled in her very soul. They looked at him through their tears in terror and a little horror. His light blue eyes were keen, small-pupilled and unnatural in their vision. Her lips parted, as she breathed with difficulty.
突然，他把手放在她的下巴下，将她的脸抬起来。她深蓝色的眼睛里满是泪水，睁大了，仿佛她的灵魂受到了惊吓。他们泪流满面地看着他，眼神里充满了惊恐和一丝惊恐。他淡蓝色的眼睛锐利，瞳孔很小，目光不自然。她的嘴唇张开，呼吸困难。

The passion came up in him, stroke after stroke, like the ringing of a bronze bell, so strong and unflawed and indomitable. His knees tightened to bronze as he hung above her soft face, whose lips parted and whose eyes dilated in a strange violation. In the grasp of his hand her chin was unutterably soft and silken. He felt strong as winter, his hands were living metal, invincible and not to be turned aside. His heart rang like a bell clanging inside him.
他心中的激情一击又一击，如铜钟鸣响，那么强烈，那么完美，那么顽强。当他悬在她柔软的脸庞上方时，他的膝盖绷紧成古铜色，她的嘴唇张开，眼睛睁大，带着一种奇怪的侵犯。在他的手中，她的下巴异常柔软，丝滑。他感觉自己像冬天一样坚强，双手如同活生生的金属，所向无敌，不容动摇。他的心像钟声一样在他体内叮当作响。

He took her up in his arms. She was soft and inert, motionless. All the while her eyes, in which the tears had not yet dried, were dilated as if in a kind of swoon of fascination and helplessness. He was superhumanly strong, and unflawed, as if invested with supernatural force.
他把她抱在怀里。她软弱无力，一动不动。她的眼睛里的泪水还没有干，一直睁大着，仿佛陷入了一种迷恋和无助的昏迷之中。他的力量超乎常人，而且毫无瑕疵，仿佛被赋予了超自然的力量。

He lifted her close and folded her against him. Her softness, her inert, relaxed weight lay against his own surcharged, bronze-like limbs in a heaviness of desirability that would destroy him, if he were not fulfilled. She moved convulsively, recoiling away from him. His heart went up like a flame of ice, he closed over her like steel. He would destroy her rather than be denied.
他将她抱近，将她叠在自己身上。她的柔软，她惰性的、放松的重量，压在他自己沉重的、青铜般的四肢上，充满了强烈的渴望，如果他得不到满足，就会毁灭他。她全身抽搐，从他身边退开。他的心如冰火般升腾，他如钢铁般将她包裹住。他宁愿毁掉她，也不愿被拒绝。

But the overweening power of his body was too much for her. She relaxed again, and lay loose and soft, panting in a little delirium. And to him, she was so sweet, she was such bliss of release, that he would have suffered a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second of this pang of unsurpassable bliss.
但他身体的强大力量，却让她承受不了。她又放松下来，松软地躺着，有些神志不清地喘息着。对他来说，她是那么的甜蜜，她是那么的解脱的幸福，他宁愿遭受永恒的折磨，也不愿放弃这无与伦比的幸福的痛苦。

‘My God,’ he said to her, his face drawn and strange, transfigured, ‘what next?’
“天啊，”他对她说，他的脸色憔悴、奇怪、变形，“接下来怎么办？”

She lay perfectly still, with a still, child-like face and dark eyes, looking at him. She was lost, fallen right away.
她一动不动地躺着，一动不动，孩子般的脸和黑色的眼睛看着他。她迷失了，立刻就倒下了。

‘I shall always love you,’ he said, looking at her.
“我会永远爱你，”他看着她说道。

But she did not hear. She lay, looking at him as at something she could never understand, never: as a child looks at a grown-up person, without hope of understanding, only submitting.
但她没有听到。她躺着，看着他，就像在看一些她永远无法理解的东西，永远无法理解：就像一个孩子看着一个成年人，不希望理解，只有屈服。

He kissed her, kissed her eyes shut, so that she could not look any more. He wanted something now, some recognition, some sign, some admission. But she only lay silent and child-like and remote, like a child that is overcome and cannot understand, only feels lost. He kissed her again, giving up.
他吻了她，吻住了她的眼睛，让她无法再看下去。他现在想要一些东西，一些认可，一些标志，一些承认。但她只是安静地躺着，像个孩子一样，遥不可及，就像一个被克服、无法理解、只感到失落的孩子。他再次吻了她，放弃了。

‘Shall we go down and have coffee and Kuchen?’ he asked.
“我们可以下去喝杯咖啡，吃点苦瓜吗？”他问。

The twilight was falling slate-blue at the window. She closed her eyes, closed away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them again to the every-day world.
窗外的暮色已是石板蓝色。她闭上眼睛，关闭单调的死亡奇迹，并再次睁开眼睛面对日常生活。

‘Yes,’ she said briefly, regaining her will with a click. She went again to the window. Blue evening had fallen over the cradle of snow and over the great pallid slopes. But in the heaven the peaks of snow were rosy, glistening like transcendent, radiant spikes of blossom in the heavenly upper-world, so lovely and beyond.
“是的，”她简短地说，咔哒一声恢复了意志。她又走到窗边。蓝色的傍晚降临在雪地和苍白的大山坡上。但天上的雪峰却是玫瑰色的，闪闪发光，就像天堂上层世界中超凡脱俗、光芒四射的花穗，那么可爱，那么超凡脱俗。

Gudrun saw all their loveliness, she KNEW how immortally beautiful they were, great pistils of rose-coloured, snow-fed fire in the blue twilight of the heaven. She could SEE it, she knew it, but she was not of it. She was divorced, debarred, a soul shut out.
古德伦看到了它们所有的可爱，她知道它们是多么不朽的美丽，在天空的蓝色暮色中，玫瑰色的巨大花蕊，雪浇灌的火焰。她可以看到它，她知道它，但她不属于它。她离婚了，被取消资格，灵魂被拒之门外。

With a last look of remorse, she turned away, and was doing her hair. He had unstrapped the luggage, and was waiting, watching her. She knew he was watching her. It made her a little hasty and feverish in her precipitation.
她带着最后一丝悔恨，转过身去梳理头发。他解开行李带，正在等待，看着她。她知道他在看着她。这让她的沉淀有些急躁和狂热。

They went downstairs, both with a strange other-world look on their faces, and with a glow in their eyes. They saw Birkin and Ursula sitting at the long table in a corner, waiting for them.
两人下了楼，脸上都带着异样的异世神色，眼眸中也闪烁着光芒。他们看到伯金和乌苏拉坐在角落里的长桌旁等着他们。

‘How good and simple they look together,’ Gudrun thought, jealously. She envied them some spontaneity, a childish sufficiency to which she herself could never approach. They seemed such children to her.
“他们在一起看起来多么美好又简单啊，”古德伦嫉妒地想。她羡慕他们的某种自发性，一种她自己永远无法达到的孩子气的自满。在她看来，他们就像孩子一样。

‘Such good Kranzkuchen!’ cried Ursula greedily. ‘So good!’
“多好的Kranzkuchen！”乌苏拉贪婪地喊道。 '超好的！'

‘Right,’ said Gudrun. ‘Can we have Kaffee mit Kranzkuchen?’ she added to the waiter.
“好吧，”古德伦说。 “我们可以喝 Kaffee mit Kranzkuchen 吗？”她对服务员补充道。

And she seated herself on the bench beside Gerald. Birkin, looking at them, felt a pain of tenderness for them.
她在杰拉尔德旁边的长凳上坐下。伯金看着他们，对他们产生了一种温柔的痛苦。

‘I think the place is really wonderful, Gerald,’ he said; ‘prachtvoll and wunderbar and wunderschon and unbeschreiblich and all the other German adjectives.’
“我认为这个地方真的很棒，杰拉德，”他说。 “prachtvoll、wunderbar、wunderschon、unbeschreiblich 以及所有其他德语形容词。”

Gerald broke into a slight smile.
杰拉尔德露出一丝微笑。

‘I like it,’ he said.
“我喜欢它，”他说。

The tables, of white scrubbed wood, were placed round three sides of the room, as in a Gasthaus. Birkin and Ursula sat with their backs to the wall, which was of oiled wood, and Gerald and Gudrun sat in the corner next them, near to the stove. It was a fairly large place, with a tiny bar, just like a country inn, but quite simple and bare, and all of oiled wood, ceilings and walls and floor, the only furniture being the tables and benches going round three sides, the great green stove, and the bar and the doors on the fourth side. The windows were double, and quite uncurtained. It was early evening.
桌子是用白色擦洗过的木头制成的，围绕房间的三个侧面放置，就像在旅馆里一样。伯金和乌苏拉背靠着墙坐着，墙上是涂油的木头，杰拉尔德和古德伦坐在他们旁边的角落里，靠近火炉。这是一个相当大的地方，有一个小酒吧，就像乡村旅馆一样，但相当简单和空旷，所有的都是涂油的木头，天花板，墙壁和地板，唯一的家具是围绕三个侧面的桌子和长凳，巨大的绿色炉子，还有酒吧和第四侧的门。窗户是双层的，而且没有窗帘。当时是傍晚。

The coffee came—hot and good—and a whole ring of cake.
咖啡端上来了——又热又好——还有一整圈蛋糕。

‘A whole Kuchen!’ cried Ursula. ‘They give you more than us! I want some of yours.’
“整个库琴！”乌苏拉喊道。 ‘他们给你的比我们多！我想要一些你的。

There were other people in the place, ten altogether, so Birkin had found out: two artists, three students, a man and wife, and a Professor and two daughters—all Germans. The four English people, being newcomers, sat in their coign of vantage to watch. The Germans peeped in at the door, called a word to the waiter, and went away again. It was not meal-time, so they did not come into this dining-room, but betook themselves, when their boots were changed, to the Reunionsaal.
伯金发现，这个地方还有其他人，总共十个人：两名艺术家、三名学生、一对夫妇、一名教授和两个女儿——都是德国人。这四个英国人都是新来的，坐在有利的位置观看。德国人从门口往里张望，对服务员喊了一声，然后又走了。现在不是吃饭时间，所以他们没有进这间餐厅，而是换了靴子后就去了团聚大厅。

The English visitors could hear the occasional twanging of a zither, the strumming of a piano, snatches of laughter and shouting and singing, a faint vibration of voices. The whole building being of wood, it seemed to carry every sound, like a drum, but instead of increasing each particular noise, it decreased it, so that the sound of the zither seemed tiny, as if a diminutive zither were playing somewhere, and it seemed the piano must be a small one, like a little spinet.
英国游客偶尔能听到古筝的弹奏声、钢琴的弹奏声、断断续续的笑声、喊叫声和歌声，还有微弱的声音颤动。整个建筑都是木头的，似乎承载着一切声音，就像鼓一样，但每一种声音不是增强，而是减弱，以至于琴声显得很小，仿佛有一把小型的琴在某处演奏，看来这架钢琴一定很小，就像一架小钢琴。

The host came when the coffee was finished. He was a Tyrolese, broad, rather flat-cheeked, with a pale, pock-marked skin and flourishing moustaches.
咖啡喝完后，主人来了。他是蒂罗尔人，身材宽阔，脸颊相当平坦，皮肤苍白，长满麻子，胡须浓密。

‘Would you like to go to the Reunionsaal to be introduced to the other ladies and gentlemen?’ he asked, bending forward and smiling, showing his large, strong teeth. His blue eyes went quickly from one to the other—he was not quite sure of his ground with these English people. He was unhappy too because he spoke no English and he was not sure whether to try his French.
“你愿意去团聚大厅被介绍给其他女士们先生们吗？”他向前弯着腰微笑着问道，露出了他又大又坚固的牙齿。他的蓝眼睛很快地从一只眼睛移到另一只眼睛——他不太确定自己与这些英国人的立场如何。他也很不高兴，因为他不会说英语，而且他不确定是否要尝试法语。

‘Shall we go to the Reunionsaal, and be introduced to the other people?’ repeated Gerald, laughing.
“我们可以去聚会大厅，然后被介绍给其他人吗？”杰拉尔德笑着重复道。

There was a moment’s hesitation.
有片刻的犹豫。

‘I suppose we’d better—better break the ice,’ said Birkin.
“我想我们最好——最好打破僵局，”伯金说。

The women rose, rather flushed. And the Wirt’s black, beetle-like, broad-shouldered figure went on ignominiously in front, towards the noise. He opened the door and ushered the four strangers into the play-room.
女人们站了起来，脸都红了。沃特人那黑色的、甲虫般的、宽肩膀的身影，可耻地走在前面，朝着噪音的方向走去。他打开门，把四个陌生人领进游戏室。

Instantly a silence fell, a slight embarrassment came over the company. The newcomers had a sense of many blond faces looking their way. Then, the host was bowing to a short, energetic-looking man with large moustaches, and saying in a low voice:
顿时一片寂静，公司里弥漫着一丝尴尬。新来的人感觉有许多金发面孔朝他们这边望来。随后，主持人向一名身材矮小，精神抖擞，留着大胡子的男子行礼，低声说道：

‘Herr Professor, darf ich vorstellen-’
“教授先生，darf ich vorstellen——”

The Herr Professor was prompt and energetic. He bowed low to the English people, smiling, and began to be a comrade at once.
教授先生反应敏捷，精力充沛。他微笑着向英国人民深深鞠了一躬，立即开始成为一名同志。

‘Nehmen die Herrschaften teil an unserer Unterhaltung?’ he said, with a vigorous suavity, his voice curling up in the question.
“Nehmen die Herrschaften teil an unserer Unterhaltung？”他语气充满活力和蔼可亲，声音在问题中变得卷曲起来。

The four English people smiled, lounging with an attentive uneasiness in the middle of the room. Gerald, who was spokesman, said that they would willingly take part in the entertainment. Gudrun and Ursula, laughing, excited, felt the eyes of all the men upon them, and they lifted their heads and looked nowhere, and felt royal.
四个英国人微笑着，神情不安地躺在房间中央。发言人杰拉德表示，他们愿意参加这次娱乐活动。古德伦和乌苏拉兴奋地笑着，感觉到所有男人的目光都注视着他们，他们抬起头，不看任何地方，感觉很高贵。

The Professor announced the names of those present, SANS CEREMONIE. There was a bowing to the wrong people and to the right people. Everybody was there, except the man and wife. The two tall, clear-skinned, athletic daughters of the professor, with their plain-cut, dark blue blouses and loden skirts, their rather long, strong necks, their clear blue eyes and carefully banded hair, and their blushes, bowed and stood back; the three students bowed very low, in the humble hope of making an impression of extreme good-breeding; then there was a thin, dark-skinned man with full eyes, an odd creature, like a child, and like a troll, quick, detached; he bowed slightly; his companion, a large fair young man, stylishly dressed, blushed to the eyes and bowed very low.
教授宣布了出席者的名字，SANS CEREMONIE。有向错误的人鞠躬，也有向正确的人鞠躬。除了丈夫和妻子之外，每个人都在那里。教授的两个高个子、皮肤白皙、运动健壮的女儿，穿着朴素的深蓝色衬衫和罗登呢裙子，脖子又长又粗，清澈的蓝眼睛，精心扎起的头发，脸红了，鞠躬站着。后退;三个学生深深地鞠了一躬，希望能给人留下极其有教养的印象。然后是一个瘦削、黑皮肤、长着一双大眼睛的男人，这是一个奇怪的生物，像一个孩子，又像一个巨魔，动作敏捷，超然。他微微鞠了一躬。他的同伴是个身材高大、皮肤白皙的年轻人，穿着时髦，脸红到了眼睛，深深地鞠了一躬。

It was over.
一切都结束了。

‘Herr Loerke was giving us a recitation in the Cologne dialect,’ said the Professor.
“洛克先生正在用科隆方言给我们朗诵，”教授说。

‘He must forgive us for interrupting him,’ said Gerald, ‘we should like very much to hear it.’
“他必须原谅我们打扰他，”杰拉尔德说，“我们非常想听听。”

There was instantly a bowing and an offering of seats. Gudrun and Ursula, Gerald and Birkin sat in the deep sofas against the wall. The room was of naked oiled panelling, like the rest of the house. It had a piano, sofas and chairs, and a couple of tables with books and magazines. In its complete absence of decoration, save for the big, blue stove, it was cosy and pleasant.
立刻有人鞠躬并让座。古德伦和乌苏拉、杰拉尔德和伯金坐在靠墙的深沙发上。这个房间和房子的其他部分一样，都是裸露的涂油镶板。里面有一架钢琴、沙发和椅子，还有几张桌子，上面放着书籍和杂志。除了蓝色的大炉子外，完全没有任何装饰，房间舒适宜人。

Herr Loerke was the little man with the boyish figure, and the round, full, sensitive-looking head, and the quick, full eyes, like a mouse’s. He glanced swiftly from one to the other of the strangers, and held himself aloof.
洛克先生身材矮小，有着男孩般的身材，圆圆的、饱满的、看起来敏感的脑袋，还有一双像老鼠一样敏捷、饱满的眼睛。他迅速地扫视了一个陌生人，又保持着冷漠的态度。

‘Please go on with the recitation,’ said the Professor, suavely, with his slight authority. Loerke, who was sitting hunched on the piano stool, blinked and did not answer.
“请继续背诵，”教授温和地说，带着一点权威。驼背坐在琴凳上的洛尔克眨了眨眼睛，没有回答。

‘It would be a great pleasure,’ said Ursula, who had been getting the sentence ready, in German, for some minutes.
“这将是一种极大的荣幸，”乌苏拉说道，她已经用德语准备了几分钟。

Then, suddenly, the small, unresponding man swung aside, towards his previous audience and broke forth, exactly as he had broken off; in a controlled, mocking voice, giving an imitation of a quarrel between an old Cologne woman and a railway guard.
然后，突然，那个毫无反应的小个子转向一边，朝着他之前的观众，像他刚刚中断的那样爆发了。用一种克制的、嘲弄的声音，模仿一位科隆老妇人和铁路警卫之间的争吵。

His body was slight and unformed, like a boy’s, but his voice was mature, sardonic, its movement had the flexibility of essential energy, and of a mocking penetrating understanding. Gudrun could not understand a word of his monologue, but she was spell-bound, watching him. He must be an artist, nobody else could have such fine adjustment and singleness. The Germans were doubled up with laughter, hearing his strange droll words, his droll phrases of dialect. And in the midst of their paroxysms, they glanced with deference at the four English strangers, the elect. Gudrun and Ursula were forced to laugh. The room rang with shouts of laughter. The blue eyes of the Professor’s daughters were swimming over with laughter-tears, their clear cheeks were flushed crimson with mirth, their father broke out in the most astonishing peals of hilarity, the students bowed their heads on their knees in excess of joy. Ursula looked round amazed, the laughter was bubbling out of her involuntarily. She looked at Gudrun. Gudrun looked at her, and the two sisters burst out laughing, carried away. Loerke glanced at them swiftly, with his full eyes. Birkin was sniggering involuntarily. Gerald Crich sat erect, with a glistening look of amusement on his face. And the laughter crashed out again, in wild paroxysms, the Professor’s daughters were reduced to shaking helplessness, the veins of the Professor’s neck were swollen, his face was purple, he was strangled in ultimate, silent spasms of laughter. The students were shouting half-articulated words that tailed off in helpless explosions. Then suddenly the rapid patter of the artist ceased, there were little whoops of subsiding mirth, Ursula and Gudrun were wiping their eyes, and the Professor was crying loudly.
他的身躯瘦小，不成形，就像一个男孩，但他的声音却成熟、讽刺，动作带着精气的灵活，还有嘲讽的透彻领悟。古德伦一句也听不懂他的独白，但她着迷地看着他。他一定是个艺术家，没有人能有如此精细的调整和单一性。德国人听到他奇怪的滑稽的词语和滑稽的方言短语，都笑得弯下身子。在他们的阵阵爆发中，他们以敬意的目光看着这四个英国陌生人，即选民。古德伦和乌苏拉被迫大笑。房间里充满了笑声。教授女儿们的蓝眼睛里泛着笑意，泪水盈盈，她们清澈的脸颊因欢笑而涨得通红，她们的父亲爆发出最令人惊讶的欢笑，学生们高兴得把头低到膝盖上。乌苏拉惊讶地环顾四周，不由自主地笑出了声。她看着古德伦。古珍看着她，两姐妹失魂落魄地大笑起来。洛尔克睁大眼睛迅速地扫了他们一眼。伯金不由自主地窃笑起来。杰拉尔德·克里奇笔直地坐着，脸上闪着一丝有趣的表情。笑声再次爆发，狂野地爆发，教授的女儿们无助地颤抖着，教授脖子上的血管肿胀，他的脸变成了紫色，他被勒死在终极的、无声的笑声痉挛中。学生们喊着含糊不清的话语，最后变成了无助的爆炸声。然后突然间，艺术家的急促的喋喋不休停止了，欢笑声渐渐平息，乌苏拉和古德伦擦着眼睛，教授大声哭泣。

‘Das war ausgezeichnet, das war famos—‘
“Das war ausgezeichnet，das war famos——”

‘Wirklich famos,’ echoed his exhausted daughters, faintly.
“Wirklich famos，”他精疲力尽的女儿们微弱地附和着。

‘And we couldn’t understand it,’ cried Ursula.
“我们无法理解它，”乌苏拉喊道。

‘Oh leider, leider!’ cried the Professor.
“哦，莱德，莱德！”教授喊道。

‘You couldn’t understand it?’ cried the Students, let loose at last in speech with the newcomers. ‘Ja, das ist wirklich schade, das ist schade, gnadige Frau. Wissen Sie—‘
“你们听不懂吗？”学生们喊道，终于在与新来者的演讲中放开了。 ‘Ja，das ist wirklich schade，das ist schade，gnadige Frau。维森·西——‘

The mixture was made, the newcomers were stirred into the party, like new ingredients, the whole room was alive. Gerald was in his element, he talked freely and excitedly, his face glistened with a strange amusement. Perhaps even Birkin, in the end, would break forth. He was shy and withheld, though full of attention.
混合物做好了，新人被搅进了聚会，就像新的配料一样，整个房间都充满了活力。杰拉尔德如鱼得水，说话自由而兴奋，脸上闪烁着一种奇怪的乐趣。也许连柏金包最终都会爆发。尽管他很受关注，但他却很害羞、沉默寡言。

Ursula was prevailed upon to sing ‘Annie Lowrie,’ as the Professor called it. There was a hush of EXTREME deference. She had never been so flattered in her life. Gudrun accompanied her on the piano, playing from memory.
乌苏拉被说服唱了教授所说的“安妮·洛瑞”。全场一片肃静，充满了极度的敬意。她这辈子从来没有受过这样的恭维。古德伦用钢琴为她伴奏，凭着记忆弹奏。

Ursula had a beautiful ringing voice, but usually no confidence, she spoiled everything. This evening she felt conceited and untrammelled. Birkin was well in the background, she shone almost in reaction, the Germans made her feel fine and infallible, she was liberated into overweening self-confidence. She felt like a bird flying in the air, as her voice soared out, enjoying herself extremely in the balance and flight of the song, like the motion of a bird’s wings that is up in the wind, sliding and playing on the air, she played with sentimentality, supported by rapturous attention. She was very happy, singing that song by herself, full of a conceit of emotion and power, working upon all those people, and upon herself, exerting herself with gratification, giving immeasurable gratification to the Germans.
乌苏拉有着优美动听的声音，但平时缺乏自信，她破坏了一切。这天晚上，她感到自负、无拘无束。柏金在幕后，她几乎在反应中闪闪发光，德国人让她感觉良好且不会犯错，她被解放为过度自信。她感觉自己就像一只在空中飞翔的小鸟，声音翱翔而出，在歌曲的平衡与飞翔中享受到了极致，就像小鸟在风中振翅的动作，在空中滑动、玩耍，她演奏时充满了感伤，并得到了热烈的关注。她很高兴，一个人唱着这首歌，充满了情感和力量，为所有的人做事，也为她自己做事，心满意足地努力，给德国人带来了不可估量的满足。

At the end, the Germans were all touched with admiring, delicious melancholy, they praised her in soft, reverent voices, they could not say too much.
到最后，德国人都被感动了，充满了钦佩，美妙的忧郁，他们用轻柔的、虔诚的声音赞美她，不能说太多。

‘Wie schon, wie ruhrend! Ach, die Schottischen Lieder, sie haben so viel Stimmung! Aber die gnadige Frau hat eine WUNDERBARE Stimme; die gnadige Frau ist wirklich eine Kunstlerin, aber wirklich!’
‘Wie schon，wie ruhrend！啊，死了肖蒂森歌曲，sie haben so viel Stimmung！ Aber die gnadige Frau hat eine WUNDERBARE Stimme； die gnadige Frau ist wirklich eine Kunstlerin, aber wirklich!’

She was dilated and brilliant, like a flower in the morning sun. She felt Birkin looking at her, as if he were jealous of her, and her breasts thrilled, her veins were all golden. She was as happy as the sun that has just opened above clouds. And everybody seemed so admiring and radiant, it was perfect.
她身材娇大，容光焕发，就像清晨阳光下的一朵花。她感觉到伯金在看着她，仿佛他在嫉妒她，她的乳房颤抖着，她的血管全都是金色的。她就像刚刚从云层中升起的太阳一样高兴。每个人都显得那么钦佩和容光焕发，这是完美的。

After dinner she wanted to go out for a minute, to look at the world. The company tried to dissuade her—it was so terribly cold. But just to look, she said.
晚饭后，她想出去走走，看看这个世界。公司试图劝阻她——天气太冷了。但只是看看，她说。

They all four wrapped up warmly, and found themselves in a vague, unsubstantial outdoors of dim snow and ghosts of an upper-world, that made strange shadows before the stars. It was indeed cold, bruisingly, frighteningly, unnaturally cold. Ursula could not believe the air in her nostrils. It seemed conscious, malevolent, purposive in its intense murderous coldness.
他们四个人都裹得暖暖的，发现自己身处一片模糊、虚无缥缈的户外，周围是昏暗的雪和上层世界的幽灵，在星星前留下了奇怪的阴影。确实很冷，冷得让人窒息，冷得可怕，冷得不自然。乌苏拉简直不敢相信自己鼻孔里的空气。它似乎是有意识的、恶毒的、有目的的，充满了强烈的杀气。

Yet it was wonderful, an intoxication, a silence of dim, unrealised snow, of the invisible intervening between her and the visible, between her and the flashing stars. She could see Orion sloping up. How wonderful he was, wonderful enough to make one cry aloud.
但这是美妙的，一种陶醉，一种昏暗、未实现的雪的寂静，一种无形的介入在她和可见的事物之间，在她和闪烁的星星之间。她可以看到猎户座正在倾斜。他是多么的美妙，美妙到让人落泪。

And all around was this cradle of snow, and there was firm snow underfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles. It was night, and silence. She imagined she could hear the stars. She imagined distinctly she could hear the celestial, musical motion of the stars, quite near at hand. She seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion.
周围都是雪的摇篮，脚下是坚硬的雪，严寒刺透了她的靴底。那是夜晚，万籁俱寂。她想象自己能听到星星的声音。她清楚地想象自己能听到星星的天体、音乐般的运动，就在附近。她就像一只鸟儿在他们和谐的动作中飞翔。

And she clung close to Birkin. Suddenly she realised she did not know what he was thinking. She did not know where he was ranging.
她紧紧抓住柏金包。突然，她发现自己不知道他在想什么。她不知道他在哪里。

‘My love!’ she said, stopping to look at him.
“我的爱人！”她停下来看着他说道。

His face was pale, his eyes dark, there was a faint spark of starlight on them. And he saw her face soft and upturned to him, very near. He kissed her softly.
他的脸色苍白，双眸漆黑，眼眸中闪烁着淡淡的星光。他看到她的脸庞柔和，仰面朝他，离他很近。他轻轻地吻了她。

‘What then?’ he asked.
“然后呢？”他问道。

‘Do you love me?’ she asked.
“你爱我吗？”她问。

‘Too much,’ he answered quietly.
“太多了。”他平静地回答。

She clung a little closer.
她靠得更近了一些。

‘Not too much,’ she pleaded.
“不要太多，”她恳求道。

‘Far too much,’ he said, almost sadly.
“太多了，”他几乎悲伤地说。

‘And does it make you sad, that I am everything to you?’ she asked, wistful. He held her close to him, kissing her, and saying, scarcely audible:
“我是你的一切，这会让你伤心吗？”她满怀渴望地问道。他把她抱在怀里，亲吻她，用几乎听不见的声音说道：

‘No, but I feel like a beggar—I feel poor.’
“不，但我感觉自己像个乞丐——我感觉很穷。”

She was silent, looking at the stars now. Then she kissed him.
她现在沉默了，看着星星。然后她吻了他。

‘Don’t be a beggar,’ she pleaded, wistfully. ‘It isn’t ignominious that you love me.’
“别当乞丐，”她若有所思地恳求道。 “你爱我并不丢脸。”

‘It is ignominious to feel poor, isn’t it?’ he replied.
“感到贫穷是可耻的，不是吗？”他回答道。

‘Why? Why should it be?’ she asked. He only stood still, in the terribly cold air that moved invisibly over the mountain tops, folding her round with his arms.
'为什么？为什么会这样呢？”她问道。他只是一动不动地站着，在山顶上无形的寒冷空气中，用双臂将她搂在怀里。

‘I couldn’t bear this cold, eternal place without you,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t bear it, it would kill the quick of my life.’
“我无法忍受这个寒冷、永恒的地方没有你，”他说。 “我无法忍受，它会夺走我的生命。”

She kissed him again, suddenly.
她突然又吻了他。

‘Do you hate it?’ she asked, puzzled, wondering.
“你讨厌它吗？”她疑惑地问道。

‘If I couldn’t come near to you, if you weren’t here, I should hate it. I couldn’t bear it,’ he answered.
‘如果我不能靠近你，如果你不在这里，我会讨厌它。我无法忍受，”他回答道。

‘But the people are nice,’ she said.
“但是人们都很好，”她说。

‘I mean the stillness, the cold, the frozen eternality,’ he said.
“我指的是寂静、寒冷、冰冻的永恒，”他说。

She wondered. Then her spirit came home to him, nestling unconscious in him.
她想知道。然后她的灵魂回到了他的身边，无意识地依偎在他体内。

‘Yes, it is good we are warm and together,’ she said.
“是的，我们在一起很温暖，这很好，”她说。

And they turned home again. They saw the golden lights of the hotel glowing out in the night of snow-silence, small in the hollow, like a cluster of yellow berries. It seemed like a bunch of sun-sparks, tiny and orange in the midst of the snow-darkness. Behind, was a high shadow of a peak, blotting out the stars, like a ghost.
他们又转身回家了。他们看到旅馆的金色灯光在雪夜寂静中闪烁着，在空旷的地方显得很小，就像一串黄色的浆果。它看起来就像一束阳光的火花，在雪夜中显得很小，呈橙色。身后，是一道高高的山峰阴影，遮蔽了星辰，如幽灵一般。

They drew near to their home. They saw a man come from the dark building, with a lighted lantern which swung golden, and made that his dark feet walked in a halo of snow. He was a small, dark figure in the darkened snow. He unlatched the door of an outhouse. A smell of cows, hot, animal, almost like beef, came out on the heavily cold air. There was a glimpse of two cattle in their dark stalls, then the door was shut again, and not a chink of light showed. It had reminded Ursula again of home, of the Marsh, of her childhood, and of the journey to Brussels, and, strangely, of Anton Skrebensky.
他们离家越来越近了。他们看见一个人从黑暗的大楼里走出来，提着一盏亮着的灯笼，灯笼发出金色的光芒，他的黑脚走在雪的光环中。在漆黑的雪地里，他是一个又小又黑的身影。他打开了外屋的门锁。一股牛的气味，热气腾腾，动物味，几乎像牛肉，在寒冷的空气中散发出来。瞥见黑暗的牛栏里有两只牛，然后门又关上了，没有一丝光亮。它再次让乌苏拉想起了家乡，想起了沼泽，想起了她的童年，想起了布鲁塞尔之旅，奇怪的是，还想起了安东·斯克雷本斯基。

Oh, God, could one bear it, this past which was gone down the abyss? Could she bear, that it ever had been! She looked round this silent, upper world of snow and stars and powerful cold. There was another world, like views on a magic lantern; The Marsh, Cossethay, Ilkeston, lit up with a common, unreal light. There was a shadowy unreal Ursula, a whole shadow-play of an unreal life. It was as unreal, and circumscribed, as a magic-lantern show. She wished the slides could all be broken. She wished it could be gone for ever, like a lantern-slide which was broken. She wanted to have no past. She wanted to have come down from the slopes of heaven to this place, with Birkin, not to have toiled out of the murk of her childhood and her upbringing, slowly, all soiled. She felt that memory was a dirty trick played upon her. What was this decree, that she should ‘remember’! Why not a bath of pure oblivion, a new birth, without any recollections or blemish of a past life. She was with Birkin, she had just come into life, here in the high snow, against the stars. What had she to do with parents and antecedents? She knew herself new and unbegotten, she had no father, no mother, no anterior connections, she was herself, pure and silvery, she belonged only to the oneness with Birkin, a oneness that struck deeper notes, sounding into the heart of the universe, the heart of reality, where she had never existed before.
天哪，这段坠入深渊的过去，还能承受得住吗？她能忍受吗？她环顾四周，这个寂静的上层世界充满了雪、星星和强烈的寒冷。那里有另外一个世界，就像神灯上的风景；沼泽地、科塞赛地、伊尔克斯顿地都被一种常见的、不真实的光芒照亮了。那里有一个阴暗虚幻的乌苏拉，一出不真实生活的皮影戏。它就像一场魔术灯笼表演一样不真实，而且受到限制。她希望幻灯片全部被打破。她希望它能永远消失，就像灯笼滑梯坏了一样。她不想拥有过去。她想和柏金一起从天堂的斜坡下来到这个地方，而不是从她童年和成长的黑暗中慢慢地走出来，一切都被玷污了。她觉得记忆是对她开的一个肮脏的把戏。这是什么法令，让她‘记住’！为什么不沐浴一次纯粹的遗忘，一次新生，没有任何前世的记忆或瑕疵。她和 Birkin 在一起，她刚刚出生，在大雪中，在星空下。她和父母、前世有什么关系？她知道自己是新的、非受生的，她没有父亲，没有母亲，没有前世的联系，她就是她自己，纯洁而银色，她只属于与伯金的合一，这种合一发出更深的音符，响彻宇宙的心脏。 ，现实的中心，她以前从未存在过。

Even Gudrun was a separate unit, separate, separate, having nothing to do with this self, this Ursula, in her new world of reality. That old shadow-world, the actuality of the past—ah, let it go! She rose free on the wings of her new condition.
甚至古德伦也是一个独立的单位，独立的，独立的，与这个自我，这个乌苏拉，在她的新现实世界中没有任何关系。那个古老的影子世界，过去的现实——啊，算了吧！她乘着新状况的翅膀自由飞翔。

Gudrun and Gerald had not come in. They had walked up the valley straight in front of the house, not like Ursula and Birkin, on to the little hill at the right. Gudrun was driven by a strange desire. She wanted to plunge on and on, till she came to the end of the valley of snow. Then she wanted to climb the wall of white finality, climb over, into the peaks that sprang up like sharp petals in the heart of the frozen, mysterious navel of the world. She felt that there, over the strange blind, terrible wall of rocky snow, there in the navel of the mystic world, among the final cluster of peaks, there, in the infolded navel of it all, was her consummation. If she could but come there, alone, and pass into the infolded navel of eternal snow and of uprising, immortal peaks of snow and rock, she would be a oneness with all, she would be herself the eternal, infinite silence, the sleeping, timeless, frozen centre of the All.
古德伦和杰拉德还没有进来。他们径直沿着房子前面的山谷走上去，不像乌苏拉和伯金那样，走到右边的小山上。古德伦被一种奇怪的欲望所驱使。她想一头扎下去，直到到达雪谷的尽头。然后她想爬上白色的终结之墙，爬过去，进入那些像锋利的花瓣一样在冰冻、神秘的世界中心涌现的山峰。她觉得，在那奇怪的、盲目的、可怕的石雪墙的上方，在神秘世界的中心，在最后的群峰之中，在这一切的折叠中心，就是她的圆满。如果她能独自来到那里，进入永恒的雪和起义的、不朽的雪和岩石山峰的内卷肚脐，她就会与一切合一，她自己就是永恒的、无限的寂静、沉睡的、永恒的、冰冻的一切中心。

They went back to the house, to the Reunionsaal. She was curious to see what was going on. The men there made her alert, roused her curiosity. It was a new taste of life for her, they were so prostrate before her, yet so full of life.
他们回到家，回到聚会大厅。她很好奇到底发生了什么。那里的男人让她警觉，激起她的好奇心。这对她来说是一种新的生活滋味，他们如此匍匐在她面前，却又如此充满生机。

The party was boisterous; they were dancing all together, dancing the Schuhplatteln, the Tyrolese dance of the clapping hands and tossing the partner in the air at the crisis. The Germans were all proficient—they were from Munich chiefly. Gerald also was quite passable. There were three zithers twanging away in a corner. It was a scene of great animation and confusion. The Professor was initiating Ursula into the dance, stamping, clapping, and swinging her high, with amazing force and zest. When the crisis came even Birkin was behaving manfully with one of the Professor’s fresh, strong daughters, who was exceedingly happy. Everybody was dancing, there was the most boisterous turmoil.
聚会很热闹。他们一起跳舞，跳Schuhplatteln，这是蒂罗尔人的拍手舞蹈，在危机时刻将舞伴抛向空中。德国人都很熟练——他们主要来自慕尼黑。杰拉德也还过得去。角落里，三把古筝正悠悠地弹着。这是一个充满活力和混乱的场景。教授引导乌苏拉跳舞，用惊人的力量和热情跺脚、拍手、高高摇摆。当危机来临时，伯金甚至对教授的一位活泼、坚强的女儿表现得很有男子气概，她非常高兴。大家都在跳舞，场面最为热闹。

Gudrun looked on with delight. The solid wooden floor resounded to the knocking heels of the men, the air quivered with the clapping hands and the zither music, there was a golden dust about the hanging lamps.
古德伦高兴地看着。坚实的木地板上响起男人们的敲击声，空气因拍手声和琴声而颤抖，吊灯上沾满了金色的灰尘。

Suddenly the dance finished, Loerke and the students rushed out to bring in drinks. There was an excited clamour of voices, a clinking of mug-lids, a great crying of ‘Prosit—Prosit!’ Loerke was everywhere at once, like a gnome, suggesting drinks for the women, making an obscure, slightly risky joke with the men, confusing and mystifying the waiter.
突然，舞蹈结束了，洛尔克和学生们冲出去拿饮料来。一阵兴奋的喧闹声、杯盖的叮当作响、一声“普罗西特——普罗西特！”的大喊声，洛尔克立刻就到处都是，像个侏儒一样，为女人们建议喝点酒，与女人们开了一个晦涩的、有点冒险的玩笑。男人，让服务员感到困惑和困惑。

He wanted very much to dance with Gudrun. From the first moment he had seen her, he wanted to make a connection with her. Instinctively she felt this, and she waited for him to come up. But a kind of sulkiness kept him away from her, so she thought he disliked her.
他非常想和古德伦跳舞。从见到她的第一刻起，他就想和她建立联系。她本能地感觉到了这一点，于是她等着他上来。但一种阴沉的情绪让他远离了她，所以她以为他不喜欢她。

‘Will you schuhplatteln, gnadige Frau?’ said the large, fair youth, Loerke’s companion. He was too soft, too humble for Gudrun’s taste. But she wanted to dance, and the fair youth, who was called Leitner, was handsome enough in his uneasy, slightly abject fashion, a humility that covered a certain fear. She accepted him as a partner.
“你愿意吗，nadige Frau？”洛尔克的同伴，身材高大、皮肤白皙的年轻人说道。他太软弱、太谦虚，不符合古珍的口味。但她想跳舞，而那个名叫莱特纳的金发青年，他那不安的、略显卑微的风格足够英俊，谦逊中掩盖着某种恐惧。她接受他作为合作伙伴。

The zithers sounded out again, the dance began. Gerald led them, laughing, with one of the Professor’s daughters. Ursula danced with one of the students, Birkin with the other daughter of the Professor, the Professor with Frau Kramer, and the rest of the men danced together, with quite as much zest as if they had had women partners.
琴声再次响起，舞会开始。杰拉尔德带着教授的一个女儿，笑着带领着他们。乌苏拉和其中一名学生一起跳舞，伯金和教授的另一个女儿一起跳舞，教授和克莱默女士一起跳舞，其余的男人一起跳舞，他们的热情就像有女舞伴一样。

Because Gudrun had danced with the well-built, soft youth, his companion, Loerke, was more pettish and exasperated than ever, and would not even notice her existence in the room. This piqued her, but she made up to herself by dancing with the Professor, who was strong as a mature, well-seasoned bull, and as full of coarse energy. She could not bear him, critically, and yet she enjoyed being rushed through the dance, and tossed up into the air, on his coarse, powerful impetus. The Professor enjoyed it too, he eyed her with strange, large blue eyes, full of galvanic fire. She hated him for the seasoned, semi-paternal animalism with which he regarded her, but she admired his weight of strength.
因为古德伦和这个身材魁梧、温柔的年轻人跳舞，他的同伴洛尔克比以前更加娇气和恼怒，甚至没有注意到她在房间里的存在。这激怒了她，但她通过与教授跳舞来弥补自己，教授像一头成熟、经验丰富的公牛一样强壮，而且充满了粗俗的能量。严格地说，她无法忍受他，但她喜欢在他粗糙而强大的推动力下，匆匆跳完舞蹈，被抛到空中。教授也很喜欢这样，他用奇怪的蓝色大眼睛看着她，眼睛里充满了电火。她恨他以老练的、半父亲般的兽性看待她，但她钦佩他的力量。

The room was charged with excitement and strong, animal emotion. Loerke was kept away from Gudrun, to whom he wanted to speak, as by a hedge of thorns, and he felt a sardonic ruthless hatred for this young love-companion, Leitner, who was his penniless dependent. He mocked the youth, with an acid ridicule, that made Leitner red in the face and impotent with resentment.
房间里充满了兴奋和强烈的动物情绪。洛尔克与他想要交谈的古德伦相距甚远，就像被荆棘篱笆所阻挡一样，他对这个年轻的爱侣莱特纳（莱特纳）感到一种讽刺和无情的仇恨，莱特纳是他身无分文的依赖者。他用尖刻的嘲讽来嘲笑这个年轻人，这让莱特纳满脸通红，怨恨得无能为力。

Gerald, who had now got the dance perfectly, was dancing again with the younger of the Professor’s daughters, who was almost dying of virgin excitement, because she thought Gerald so handsome, so superb. He had her in his power, as if she were a palpitating bird, a fluttering, flushing, bewildered creature. And it made him smile, as she shrank convulsively between his hands, violently, when he must throw her into the air. At the end, she was so overcome with prostrate love for him, that she could scarcely speak sensibly at all.
杰拉尔德现在已经完美地掌握了舞蹈，又和教授的小女儿一起跳舞，她几乎要因处女般的兴奋而死去，因为她觉得杰拉尔德是如此英俊，如此出色。他掌控着她，仿佛她是一只颤动的小鸟，一只扑腾着翅膀、脸红、困惑的生物。当他必须把她扔到空中时，当她在他的双手之间剧烈地痉挛地收缩时，这让他微笑起来。最后，她完全被对他的爱所征服，几乎无法理智地说话。

Birkin was dancing with Ursula. There were odd little fires playing in his eyes, he seemed to have turned into something wicked and flickering, mocking, suggestive, quite impossible. Ursula was frightened of him, and fascinated. Clear, before her eyes, as in a vision, she could see the sardonic, licentious mockery of his eyes, he moved towards her with subtle, animal, indifferent approach. The strangeness of his hands, which came quick and cunning, inevitably to the vital place beneath her breasts, and, lifting with mocking, suggestive impulse, carried her through the air as if without strength, through blackmagic, made her swoon with fear. For a moment she revolted, it was horrible. She would break the spell. But before the resolution had formed she had submitted again, yielded to her fear. He knew all the time what he was doing, she could see it in his smiling, concentrated eyes. It was his responsibility, she would leave it to him.
伯金和乌苏拉一起跳舞。他的眼里闪烁着奇怪的小火焰，他似乎变成了某种邪恶的、闪烁的、嘲弄的、暗示的、完全不可能的东西。乌苏拉既害怕他，又着迷。她的眼前，仿佛在幻象中，清晰地看到了他眼中的讽刺、淫荡的嘲讽，他以微妙、兽性、冷漠的方式向她走来。他那陌生的双手，迅速而狡猾，不可避免地触及她胸部下方的要害部位，并带着嘲弄和暗示的冲动举起她，通过黑魔法，仿佛没有力量一样将她带到空中，让她因恐惧而昏厥。有那么一刻，她感到反抗，这太可怕了。她会打破这个咒语。但在下定决心之前，她又屈服了，屈服于她的恐惧。他一直都知道自己在做什么，她可以从他微笑、专注的眼睛中看到这一点。这是他的责任，她就交给他了。

When they were alone in the darkness, she felt the strange, licentiousness of him hovering upon her. She was troubled and repelled. Why should he turn like this?
当他们独自在黑暗中时，她感觉到他身上奇怪而放荡的气息盘旋在她身上。她感到困扰和排斥。他为什么要变成这样？

‘What is it?’ she asked in dread.
“这是什么？”她害怕地问。

But his face only glistened on her, unknown, horrible. And yet she was fascinated. Her impulse was to repel him violently, break from this spell of mocking brutishness. But she was too fascinated, she wanted to submit, she wanted to know. What would he do to her?
但他的脸只在她身上闪闪发光，陌生、可怕。但她还是着迷。她的冲动是要猛烈地排斥他，摆脱这种嘲讽的野蛮魔咒。但她太着迷了，她想屈服，她想知道。他会对她做什么？

He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered over his face and looked from his narrowed eyes, made her want to hide, to hide herself away from him and watch him from somewhere unseen.
他是如此迷人，却又如此令人厌恶。他的脸上闪烁着嘲讽的暗示，从他眯起的眼睛里看出来，让她想要躲起来，想要躲开他，在某个看不见的地方看着他。

‘Why are you like this?’ she demanded again, rousing against him with sudden force and animosity.
“你为什么这样？”她再次问道，突然间充满了力量和敌意，对他产生了强烈的反抗。

The flickering fires in his eyes concentrated as he looked into her eyes. Then the lids drooped with a faint motion of satiric contempt. Then they rose again to the same remorseless suggestivity. And she gave way, he might do as he would. His licentiousness was repulsively attractive. But he was self-responsible, she would see what it was.
当他看着她的眼睛时，他眼中闪烁的火焰集中了。然后，他的眼皮垂了下来，做出了一种微弱的讽刺轻蔑的动作。然后他们又再次表现出同样无情的暗示。她让步了，他可能会做他想做的事。他的放荡具有令人厌恶的吸引力。但他对自己负责，她会看看那是什么。

They might do as they liked—this she realised as she went to sleep. How could anything that gave one satisfaction be excluded? What was degrading? Who cared? Degrading things were real, with a different reality. And he was so unabashed and unrestrained. Wasn’t it rather horrible, a man who could be so soulful and spiritual, now to be so—she balked at her own thoughts and memories: then she added—so bestial? So bestial, they two!—so degraded! She winced. But after all, why not? She exulted as well. Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of experience? She exulted in it. She was bestial. How good it was to be really shameful! There would be no shameful thing she had not experienced. Yet she was unabashed, she was herself. Why not? She was free, when she knew everything, and no dark shameful things were denied her.
他们可以为所欲为——她在入睡时意识到这一点。任何能让人满意的事情怎么可能被排除在外呢？什么是有辱人格的？谁在乎？有辱人格的事情是真实存在的，但现实却不同。而他又是那么的毫不掩饰，肆无忌惮。一个原本可以如此深情、如此有灵性的男人，现在变成这样，这不是太可怕了吗——她对自己的想法和记忆犹豫不决：然后她补充道——如此兽性？他们两个太野蛮了！——太堕落了！她皱起了眉头。但毕竟，为什么不呢？她也欣喜若狂。为什么不表现得像野兽一样，进行全方位的体验呢？她为此欣喜若狂。她是兽性的。能真正感到羞耻该多好啊！没有什么丢人的事她没有经历过。但她却毫不掩饰，她就是她自己。为什么不？当她知道一切时，她就自由了，没有什么黑暗可耻的事情会被拒绝。

Gudrun, who had been watching Gerald in the Reunionsaal, suddenly thought:
一直在团聚大厅看着杰拉德的古德伦突然想到：

‘He should have all the women he can—it is his nature. It is absurd to call him monogamous—he is naturally promiscuous. That is his nature.’
“他应该拥有所有他能拥有的女人——这是他的本性。称他为一夫一妻制是荒谬的——他生来就是乱交的。这就是他的本性。

The thought came to her involuntarily. It shocked her somewhat. It was as if she had seen some new MENE! MENE! upon the wall. Yet it was merely true. A voice seemed to have spoken it to her so clearly, that for the moment she believed in inspiration.
她不由自主地产生了这个念头。让她有些震惊。就好像她看到了一些新的MENE！梅内！在墙上。但这只是事实。似乎有一个声音如此清晰地对她诉说，以至于此刻她相信灵感。

‘It is really true,’ she said to herself again.
“这确实是真的，”她再次对自己说。

She knew quite well she had believed it all along. She knew it implicitly. But she must keep it dark—almost from herself. She must keep it completely secret. It was knowledge for her alone, and scarcely even to be admitted to herself.
她很清楚，她一直都相信这一点。她心知肚明。但她必须保守秘密——几乎不让她自己知道。她必须完全保密。这是她一个人的知识，甚至连她自己都不敢承认。

The deep resolve formed in her, to combat him. One of them must triumph over the other. Which should it be? Her soul steeled itself with strength. Almost she laughed within herself, at her confidence. It woke a certain keen, half contemptuous pity, tenderness for him: she was so ruthless.
她心中下定了决心，要与他战斗。他们中的一个必须战胜另一个。应该是哪个？她的灵魂因力量而变得坚强。她几乎在心里嘲笑自己的自信。这激起了他对他的某种强烈的、半轻蔑的怜悯和温柔：她是如此无情。

Everybody retired early. The Professor and Loerke went into a small lounge to drink. They both watched Gudrun go along the landing by the railing upstairs.
大家都提前退休了。教授和洛克走进一间小休息室喝酒。他们俩看着古德伦沿着栏杆走上楼。

‘Ein schones Frauenzimmer,’ said the Professor.
“Ein Schones Frauenzimmer，”教授说。

‘Ja!’ asserted Loerke, shortly.
“啊！”洛克简短地说。

Gerald walked with his queer, long wolf-steps across the bedroom to the window, stooped and looked out, then rose again, and turned to Gudrun, his eyes sharp with an abstract smile. He seemed very tall to her, she saw the glisten of his whitish eyebrows, that met between his brows.
杰拉尔德迈着奇怪的、长长的狼步穿过卧室走到窗前，弯下腰向外望去，然后再次站起来，转向古德伦，他的眼睛锐利，带着抽象的微笑。在她看来，他很高，她看到他眉间相交的白色眉毛闪闪发光。

‘How do you like it?’ he said.
“你觉得怎么样？”他说。

He seemed to be laughing inside himself, quite unconsciously. She looked at him. He was a phenomenon to her, not a human being: a sort of creature, greedy.
他的内心似乎在无意识地笑。她看着他。对她来说，他是一种现象，而不是一个人：一种贪婪的生物。

‘I like it very much,’ she replied.
“我非常喜欢它，”她回答道。

‘Who do you like best downstairs?’ he asked, standing tall and glistening above her, with his glistening stiff hair erect.
“你最喜欢楼下的谁？”他问道，高高地站在她上方，闪闪发亮，硬邦邦的头发直立着。

‘Who do I like best?’ she repeated, wanting to answer his question, and finding it difficult to collect herself. ‘Why I don’t know, I don’t know enough about them yet, to be able to say. Who do YOU like best?’
“我最喜欢谁？”她重复道，想回答他的问题，却发现自己很难平静下来。 ‘为什么我不知道，我对他们还不够了解，无法说。你最喜欢谁？

‘Oh, I don’t care—I don’t like or dislike any of them. It doesn’t matter about me. I wanted to know about you.’
“哦，我不在乎——我不喜欢也不不喜欢他们中的任何一个。这与我无关。我想了解你。

‘But why?’ she asked, going rather pale. The abstract, unconscious smile in his eyes was intensified.
“但是为什么呢？”她问，脸色变得相当苍白。他眼中那抽象的、无意识的笑容更加强烈了。

‘I wanted to know,’ he said.
“我想知道，”他说。

She turned aside, breaking the spell. In some strange way, she felt he was getting power over her.
她转过身去，打破了咒语。以某种奇怪的方式，她觉得他正在掌控她。

‘Well, I can’t tell you already,’ she said.
“好吧，我现在还不能告诉你，”她说。

She went to the mirror to take out the hairpins from her hair. She stood before the mirror every night for some minutes, brushing her fine dark hair. It was part of the inevitable ritual of her life.
她走到镜子前，把头发上的发夹取下来。她每天晚上都会在镜子前站几分钟，梳理她细密的黑发。这是她生活中不可避免的仪式的一部分。

He followed her, and stood behind her. She was busy with bent head, taking out the pins and shaking her warm hair loose. When she looked up, she saw him in the glass standing behind her, watching unconsciously, not consciously seeing her, and yet watching, with finepupilled eyes that SEEMED to smile, and which were not really smiling.
他跟在她身后，站在她身后。她低着头，忙着取出别针，甩开温暖的头发。当她抬起头时，她看到玻璃里的他站在她身后，无意识地看着她，无意识地看着她，却又看着她，那双细细的眼睛似乎在微笑，但其实并不是真的在微笑。

She started. It took all her courage for her to continue brushing her hair, as usual, for her to pretend she was at her ease. She was far, far from being at her ease with him. She beat her brains wildly for something to say to him.
她开始。她鼓足了勇气，才像往常一样继续梳理头发，装出一副轻松自在的样子。她和他相处的时候，实在是太不自在了。她绞尽脑汁想对他说些什么。

‘What are your plans for tomorrow?’ she asked nonchalantly, whilst her heart was beating so furiously, her eyes were so bright with strange nervousness, she felt he could not but observe. But she knew also that he was completely blind, blind as a wolf looking at her. It was a strange battle between her ordinary consciousness and his uncanny, black-art consciousness.
“你明天有什么计划？”她漫不经心地问道，她的心跳得如此剧烈，她的眼睛如此明亮，充满了奇怪的紧张，她觉得他不得不观察。但她也知道，他完全瞎了，瞎得像头狼一样看着她。这是她平凡的意识和他诡异的黑魔法意识之间的一场奇怪的战斗。

‘I don’t know,’ he replied, ‘what would you like to do?’
“我不知道，”他回答道，“你想做什么？”

He spoke emptily, his mind was sunk away.
他说话空洞，脑子一片空白。

‘Oh,’ she said, with easy protestation, ‘I’m ready for anything—anything will be fine for ME, I’m sure.’
“哦，”她轻松地抗议道，“我已经做好了一切准备——我确信，任何事情对我来说都会好起来的。”

And to herself she was saying: ‘God, why am I so nervous—why are you so nervous, you fool. If he sees it I’m done for forever—you KNOW you’re done for forever, if he sees the absurd state you’re in.’
她对自己说：‘上帝啊，我为什么这么紧张——你为什么这么紧张，你这个傻瓜。如果他看到了，我就永远完了——如果他看到你所处的荒谬状态，你就知道你永远完了。

And she smiled to herself as if it were all child’s play. Meanwhile her heart was plunging, she was almost fainting. She could see him, in the mirror, as he stood there behind her, tall and over-arching—blond and terribly frightening. She glanced at his reflection with furtive eyes, willing to give anything to save him from knowing she could see him. He did not know she could see his reflection. He was looking unconsciously, glisteningly down at her head, from which the hair fell loose, as she brushed it with wild, nervous hand. She held her head aside and brushed and brushed her hair madly. For her life, she could not turn round and face him. For her life, SHE COULD NOT. And the knowledge made her almost sink to the ground in a faint, helpless, spent. She was aware of his frightening, impending figure standing close behind her, she was aware of his hard, strong, unyielding chest, close upon her back. And she felt she could not bear it any more, in a few minutes she would fall down at his feet, grovelling at his feet, and letting him destroy her.
她对自己微笑，仿佛这只是儿戏。与此同时，她的心猛地一沉，几乎要晕倒了。她可以在镜子里看到他，他站在她身后，身材高大，身材魁梧——金发碧眼，非常可怕。她偷偷地看着他的倒影，愿意付出一切来阻止他知道她能看到他。他不知道她能看到他的倒影。他无意识地低下头，闪闪发光地看着她的头，她用狂野而紧张的手梳理着头发，头发从头顶散落下来。她把头偏到一边，疯狂地梳理着头发。她这辈子都无法转身面对他。对于她的一生来说，她不能。而这些知识让她几乎昏倒在地，无助、疲惫。她意识到他那可怕的、逼近的身影紧贴在她身后，她意识到他坚硬、有力、不屈的胸膛紧贴在她的背上。她觉得自己再也无法忍受了，几分钟后她就会跪倒在他的脚下，跪倒在他的脚下，让他毁掉她。

The thought pricked up all her sharp intelligence and presence of mind. She dared not turn round to him—and there he stood motionless, unbroken. Summoning all her strength, she said, in a full, resonant, nonchalant voice, that was forced out with all her remaining self-control:
这个想法激发了她敏锐的智慧和冷静。她不敢回头看他——而他却一动不动地站在那里，毫发无伤。她用尽全身的力气，用她仅存的自制力强行挤出来的浑厚、洪亮、漫不经心的声音说道：

‘Oh, would you mind looking in that bag behind there and giving me my—‘
“哦，你介意看看后面的那个袋子，然后把我的——”

Here her power fell inert. ‘My what—my what—?’ she screamed in silence to herself.
在这里，她的力量失去了活力。 “我的什么——我的什么——？”她默默地对自己尖叫。

But he had started round, surprised and startled that she should ask him to look in her bag, which she always kept so VERY private to herself.
但他突然转过身来，惊讶又震惊地发现她竟然让他看她的包，而她总是把包保密得非常私密。

She turned now, her face white, her dark eyes blazing with uncanny, overwrought excitement. She saw him stooping to the bag, undoing the loosely buckled strap, unattentive.
她转过身来，脸色苍白，黑色的眼睛里闪烁着不可思议的、过度兴奋的光芒。她看见他弯腰走向包，漫不经心地解开松松带扣的带子。

‘Your what?’ he asked.
“你的什么？”他问。

‘Oh, a little enamel box—yellow—with a design of a cormorant plucking her breast—‘
“哦，一个小珐琅盒子——黄色——上面画着一只鸬鹚啄食乳房的图案——”

She went towards him, stooping her beautiful, bare arm, and deftly turned some of her things, disclosing the box, which was exquisitely painted.
她走向他，弯下美丽的裸露手臂，灵巧地转动了一些东西，露出了那个画得精美的盒子。

‘That is it, see,’ she said, taking it from under his eyes.
“就是这样，瞧，”她说，把它从他的眼睛下面拿出来。

And he was baffled now. He was left to fasten up the bag, whilst she swiftly did up her hair for the night, and sat down to unfasten her shoes. She would not turn her back to him any more.
而他现在很困惑。他留下来系好包，而她则迅速盘起头发，坐下来解鞋带。她不会再背对着他了。

He was baffled, frustrated, but unconscious. She had the whip hand over him now. She knew he had not realised her terrible panic. Her heart was beating heavily still. Fool, fool that she was, to get into such a state! How she thanked God for Gerald’s obtuse blindness. Thank God he could see nothing.
他感到困惑、沮丧，但无意识。她现在把鞭子握在了他身上。她知道他没有意识到她可怕的恐慌。她的心仍在剧烈地跳动。她真是个傻子，真是个傻子，竟然沦落到这样的地步！她多么感谢上帝让杰拉尔德迟钝失明。感谢上帝，他什么也看不见。

She sat slowly unlacing her shoes, and he too commenced to undress. Thank God that crisis was over. She felt almost fond of him now, almost in love with him.
她坐下来慢慢解开鞋带，他也开始脱衣服。感谢上帝，危机结束了。她现在感觉几乎喜欢他，几乎爱上他了。

‘Ah, Gerald,’ she laughed, caressively, teasingly, ‘Ah, what a fine game you played with the Professor’s daughter—didn’t you now?’
“啊，杰拉德，”她温柔地、戏谑地笑道，“啊，你和教授的女儿玩了多么精彩的游戏啊——不是吗？”

‘What game?’ he asked, looking round.
“什么游戏？”他环顾四周问道。

‘ISN’T she in love with you—oh DEAR, isn’t she in love with you!’ said Gudrun, in her gayest, most attractive mood.
“她不是爱着你吗——噢，亲爱的，她不是爱着你吗！”古珍带着最快乐、最迷人的心情说道。

‘I shouldn’t think so,’ he said.
“我不应该这么认为，”他说。

‘Shouldn’t think so!’ she teased. ‘Why the poor girl is lying at this moment overwhelmed, dying with love for you. She thinks you’re WONDERFUL—oh marvellous, beyond what man has ever been. REALLY, isn’t it funny?’
“不应该这么想！”她开玩笑道。 ‘为什么这个可怜的女孩此时此刻正不知所措地躺着，带着对你的爱而死去。她认为你太棒了——哦太棒了，超越了人类。真的，这不是很有趣吗？

‘Why funny, what is funny?’ he asked.
“为什么好笑，什么好笑？”他问道。

‘Why to see you working it on her,’ she said, with a half reproach that confused the male conceit in him. ‘Really Gerald, the poor girl—!’
“为什么要看到你在她身上做这件事呢？”她说，语气中带着半点责备，这让他内心的男性自负感到困惑。 “真是杰拉德，这个可怜的女孩——！”

‘I did nothing to her,’ he said.
“我没有对她做任何事，”他说。

‘Oh, it was too shameful, the way you simply swept her off her feet.’
“哦，这太丢脸了，你就这样让她神魂颠倒。”

‘That was Schuhplatteln,’ he replied, with a bright grin.
“那是 Schuhplatteln，”他笑着回答。

‘Ha—ha—ha!’ laughed Gudrun.
“哈——哈——哈！”古德伦笑道。

Her mockery quivered through his muscles with curious re-echoes. When he slept he seemed to crouch down in the bed, lapped up in his own strength, that yet was hollow.
她的嘲讽在他的肌肉中颤抖着，引起了奇怪的回响。当他睡觉时，他似乎蹲在床上，用自己的力量包裹着自己，但那是空的。

And Gudrun slept strongly, a victorious sleep. Suddenly, she was almost fiercely awake. The small timber room glowed with the dawn, that came upwards from the low window. She could see down the valley when she lifted her head: the snow with a pinkish, half-revealed magic, the fringe of pine-trees at the bottom of the slope. And one tiny figure moved over the vaguely-illuminated space.
古德伦睡得很香，睡得很香。突然，她几乎猛地清醒了。黎明的光线从低矮的窗户照进来，小木房闪闪发光。当她抬起头时，她可以看到山谷下方：带着半显魔法的粉红色的雪，斜坡底部的松树边缘。昏暗的空间里，一道微小的身影缓缓移动。

She glanced at his watch; it was seven o’clock. He was still completely asleep. And she was so hard awake, it was almost frightening—a hard, metallic wakefulness. She lay looking at him.
她看了一眼他的手表；现在是七点钟。他还完全睡着了。她是如此清醒，几乎令人恐惧——一种坚硬的、金属般的清醒。她躺着看着他。

He slept in the subjection of his own health and defeat. She was overcome by a sincere regard for him. Till now, she was afraid before him. She lay and thought about him, what he was, what he represented in the world. A fine, independent will, he had. She thought of the revolution he had worked in the mines, in so short a time. She knew that, if he were confronted with any problem, any hard actual difficulty, he would overcome it. If he laid hold of any idea, he would carry it through. He had the faculty of making order out of confusion. Only let him grip hold of a situation, and he would bring to pass an inevitable conclusion.
他在自己的健康和失败的支配下沉睡着。她对他充满了真诚的敬意。直到现在，她在他面前都是害怕的。她躺着，想着他，他是什么，他在世界上代表着什么。他有良好的、独立的意志。她想起了他在这么短的时间内在矿井中进行的革命。她知道，如果他遇到任何问题，任何艰难的实际困难，他都会克服的。如果他有任何想法，他就会付诸实践。他具有化解混乱的能力。只要让他抓住局势，他就会得出一个必然的结论。

For a few moments she was borne away on the wild wings of ambition. Gerald, with his force of will and his power for comprehending the actual world, should be set to solve the problems of the day, the problem of industrialism in the modern world. She knew he would, in the course of time, effect the changes he desired, he could re-organise the industrial system. She knew he could do it. As an instrument, in these things, he was marvellous, she had never seen any man with his potentiality. He was unaware of it, but she knew.
有那么一会儿，她被野心的狂野翅膀所飞翔。杰拉尔德凭借他的意志力和理解现实世界的能力，应该致力于解决当今的问题，即现代世界的工业主义问题。她知道，随着时间的推移，他会实现他想要的改变，他可以重组工业体系。她知道他能做到。作为一个工具，在这些方面，他是非常出色的，她从未见过有哪个男人有他的潜力。他不知道，但她知道。

He only needed to be hitched on, he needed that his hand should be set to the task, because he was so unconscious. And this she could do. She would marry him, he would go into Parliament in the Conservative interest, he would clear up the great muddle of labour and industry. He was so superbly fearless, masterful, he knew that every problem could be worked out, in life as in geometry. And he would care neither about himself nor about anything but the pure working out of the problem. He was very pure, really.
他只需要被拴住，他需要他的手应该放在任务上，因为他是如此无意识。而这她能做到。她会嫁给他，他会为了保守党的利益进入议会，他会清理劳工和工业的巨大混乱。他是如此无所畏惧、高超，他知道每一个问题都可以解决，无论是在生活中还是在几何学中。他不会关心自己，也不会关心任何事情，只关心解决问题。他真的很纯洁。

Her heart beat fast, she flew away on wings of elation, imagining a future. He would be a Napoleon of peace, or a Bismarck—and she the woman behind him. She had read Bismarck’s letters, and had been deeply moved by them. And Gerald would be freer, more dauntless than Bismarck.
她的心跳得很快，她乘着兴高采烈的翅膀飞走了，想象着未来。他会成为和平的拿破仑，或者俾斯麦——而她就是他身后的女人。她读过俾斯麦的信，并深受感动。杰拉尔德会比俾斯麦更自由、更无畏。

But even as she lay in fictitious transport, bathed in the strange, false sunshine of hope in life, something seemed to snap in her, and a terrible cynicism began to gain upon her, blowing in like a wind. Everything turned to irony with her: the last flavour of everything was ironical. When she felt her pang of undeniable reality, this was when she knew the hard irony of hopes and ideas.
但就在她躺在虚构的兴奋之中，沐浴在生活希望的奇怪而虚假的阳光下时，她身上似乎有什么东西突然断裂了，一种可怕的愤世嫉俗开始向她袭来，像风一样吹来。对她来说，一切都变得讽刺：一切的最后味道都是讽刺。当她感受到不可否认的现实的痛苦时，她就知道了希望和想法的残酷讽刺。

She lay and looked at him, as he slept. He was sheerly beautiful, he was a perfect instrument. To her mind, he was a pure, inhuman, almost superhuman instrument. His instrumentality appealed so strongly to her, she wished she were God, to use him as a tool.
当他熟睡时，她躺着看着他。他非常美丽，他是一个完美的乐器。在她看来，他是一个纯粹的、非人的、近乎超人的工具。他的工具性如此强烈地吸引着她，她希望自己是上帝，使用他作为工具。

And at the same instant, came the ironical question: ‘What for?’ She thought of the colliers’ wives, with their linoleum and their lace curtains and their little girls in high-laced boots. She thought of the wives and daughters of the pit-managers, their tennis-parties, and their terrible struggles to be superior each to the other, in the social scale. There was Shortlands with its meaningless distinction, the meaningless crowd of the Criches. There was London, the House of Commons, the extant social world. My God!
与此同时，一个讽刺的问题出现了：“为什么？”她想到了煤矿工人的妻子，她们穿着油毡和蕾丝窗帘，还有穿着高带靴子的小女儿。她想到了球场经理的妻子和女儿，他们的网球派对，以及他们为了在社会地位上超越对方而进行的可怕斗争。肖特兰有着毫无意义的区别，克里奇家族毫无意义的人群。那里有伦敦、下议院、现存的社交世界。我的上帝！

Young as she was, Gudrun had touched the whole pulse of social England. She had no ideas of rising in the world. She knew, with the perfect cynicism of cruel youth, that to rise in the world meant to have one outside show instead of another, the advance was like having a spurious half-crown instead of a spurious penny. The whole coinage of valuation was spurious. Yet of course, her cynicism knew well enough that, in a world where spurious coin was current, a bad sovereign was better than a bad farthing. But rich and poor, she despised both alike.
古德伦虽然年轻，却已经触及了英国社会的整个脉搏。她没有在世界上崛起的想法。她知道，带着残酷年轻人的完美愤世嫉俗，在世界上崛起意味着有一场外部表演而不是另一场表演，预付款就像拥有一个虚假的半冠而不是一个虚假的便士。整个估值的创造都是虚假的。当然，她的愤世嫉俗很清楚，在一个假币盛行的世界里，劣质主权比劣币好。但无论贫富，她都同样鄙视。

Already she mocked at herself for her dreams. They could be fulfilled easily enough. But she recognised too well, in her spirit, the mockery of her own impulses. What did she care, that Gerald had created a richly-paying industry out of an old worn-out concern? What did she care? The worn-out concern and the rapid, splendidly organised industry, they were bad money. Yet of course, she cared a great deal, outwardly—and outwardly was all that mattered, for inwardly was a bad joke.
她已经开始嘲笑自己的梦想了。他们很容易就能实现。但她在内心深处清楚地认识到，自己的冲动是在嘲笑。杰拉德从一家老旧的企业中创建了一个高薪行业，她关心什么？她在乎什么？破旧的企业和快速、组织良好的工业，它们都是劣币。然而，当然，她非常关心外表——外表才是最重要的，因为内心是一个糟糕的笑话。

Everything was intrinsically a piece of irony to her. She leaned over Gerald and said in her heart, with compassion:
一切对她来说本质上都是一种讽刺。她俯身靠近杰拉德，在心里充满同情地说：

‘Oh, my dear, my dear, the game isn’t worth even you. You are a fine thing really—why should you be used on such a poor show!’
‘哦，亲爱的，亲爱的，这个游戏连你都不值得。你真是个好东西，为什么要用你来演这么差劲的节目呢！

Her heart was breaking with pity and grief for him. And at the same moment, a grimace came over her mouth, of mocking irony at her own unspoken tirade. Ah, what a farce it was! She thought of Parnell and Katherine O’Shea. Parnell! After all, who can take the nationalisation of Ireland seriously? Who can take political Ireland really seriously, whatever it does? And who can take political England seriously? Who can? Who can care a straw, really, how the old patched-up Constitution is tinkered at any more? Who cares a button for our national ideas, any more than for our national bowler hat? Aha, it is all old hat, it is all old bowler hat!
她的心因对他的怜悯和悲伤而破碎。与此同时，她嘴角露出一丝苦笑，对她自己无声的长篇大论表示嘲讽。啊，这真是一场闹剧！她想到了帕内尔和凯瑟琳·奥谢。帕内尔！毕竟，谁能认真对待爱尔兰的国有化呢？无论爱尔兰做什么，谁能真正认真对待政治爱尔兰？谁能认真对待政治英格兰？谁可以？真的，谁会关心旧的修补好的宪法是如何被修改的呢？谁会关心我们国家理念的纽扣，就像我们国家圆顶礼帽的纽扣一样？啊哈，都是旧帽子，都是旧圆顶礼帽！

That’s all it is, Gerald, my young hero. At any rate we’ll spare ourselves the nausea of stirring the old broth any more. You be beautiful, my Gerald, and reckless. There ARE perfect moments. Wake up, Gerald, wake up, convince me of the perfect moments. Oh, convince me, I need it.
就是这样，杰拉尔德，我的年轻英雄。无论如何，我们不会再因为搅拌老汤而感到恶心了。你要美丽，我的杰拉德，而且要鲁莽。有完美的时刻。醒来吧，杰拉德，醒来吧，让我相信那些完美的时刻。哦，说服我，我需要它。

He opened his eyes, and looked at her. She greeted him with a mocking, enigmatic smile in which was a poignant gaiety. Over his face went the reflection of the smile, he smiled, too, purely unconsciously.
他睁开眼睛，看着她。她用一种嘲弄的、神秘的微笑迎接他，其中有一种令人心酸的快乐。他的脸上反射着微笑，他也笑了，纯粹是无意识的。

That filled her with extraordinary delight, to see the smile cross his face, reflected from her face. She remembered that was how a baby smiled. It filled her with extraordinary radiant delight.
看到他脸上的笑容反映在她的脸上，她感到非常高兴。她记得那是婴儿的微笑。这让她充满了非凡的、容光焕发的喜悦。

‘You’ve done it,’ she said.
“你已经做到了，”她说。

‘What?’ he asked, dazed.
“什么？”他茫然地问道。

‘Convinced me.’
“说服了我。”

And she bent down, kissing him passionately, passionately, so that he was bewildered. He did not ask her of what he had convinced her, though he meant to. He was glad she was kissing him. She seemed to be feeling for his very heart to touch the quick of him. And he wanted her to touch the quick of his being, he wanted that most of all.
而她弯下身子，热烈地、热烈地吻着他，让他不知所措。他并没有问她他说服了她什么，尽管他有意这么做。他很高兴她在吻他。她似乎在感受他的心，想要触碰他的痛处。他想要她触碰他的身体，这是他最想要的。

Outside, somebody was singing, in a manly, reckless handsome voice:
外面，有人在唱歌，用一种男子气概、鲁莽帅气的声音：

‘Mach mir auf, mach mir auf, du Stolze,
‘马赫米尔奥夫，马赫米尔奥夫，杜斯托尔兹，

Mach mir ein Feuer von Holze.
Mach mir ein Feuer von Holze。

Vom Regen bin ich nass
沃姆·雷根·本·奇纳斯

Vom Regen bin ich nass-’

Gudrun knew that that song would sound through her eternity, sung in a manly, reckless, mocking voice. It marked one of her supreme moments, the supreme pangs of her nervous gratification. There it was, fixed in eternity for her.
古德伦知道这首歌会在她的永恒中响起，用一种男子气概、鲁莽、嘲讽的声音唱。这标志着她最重要的时刻之一，是她神经满足的最大痛苦。它就在那里，为她永恒固定。

The day came fine and bluish. There was a light wind blowing among the mountain tops, keen as a rapier where it touched, carrying with it a fine dust of snow-powder. Gerald went out with the fine, blind face of a man who is in his state of fulfilment. Gudrun and he were in perfect static unity this morning, but unseeing and unwitting. They went out with a toboggan, leaving Ursula and Birkin to follow.
这一天天气晴朗，蔚蓝。山顶上吹着一阵微风，刮过的地方如剑般锐利，夹带着细细的雪粉。杰拉尔德走出去时，脸上有着一张漂亮而盲目的脸，就像一个正处于成就状态的人。今天早上古德伦和他处于完美的静止状态，但他们却看不见、不知情。他们驾着平底雪橇出去，留下乌苏拉和伯金跟在后面。

Gudrun was all scarlet and royal blue—a scarlet jersey and cap, and a royal blue skirt and stockings. She went gaily over the white snow, with Gerald beside her, in white and grey, pulling the little toboggan. They grew small in the distance of snow, climbing the steep slope.
古德伦全身都是猩红色和宝蓝色——猩红色的球衣和帽子，宝蓝色的裙子和长袜。她欢快地在白雪上行走，身着白色和灰色衣服的杰拉尔德在她身边，拉着小雪橇。他们在远处的雪中变小，爬上陡峭的斜坡。

For Gudrun herself, she seemed to pass altogether into the whiteness of the snow, she became a pure, thoughtless crystal. When she reached the top of the slope, in the wind, she looked round, and saw peak beyond peak of rock and snow, bluish, transcendent in heaven. And it seemed to her like a garden, with the peaks for pure flowers, and her heart gathering them. She had no separate consciousness for Gerald.
对于古珍本人来说，她似乎完全融入了雪的洁白之中，她变成了一颗纯净的、无思想的水晶。当她到达坡顶时，在风中环顾四周，只见山峰之外的岩石和雪，碧蓝的，超然于天堂。对她来说，这就像一个花园，山峰上开满了纯洁的花朵，她的心在收集它们。她对杰拉尔德没有单独的意识。

She held on to him as they went sheering down over the keen slope. She felt as if her senses were being whetted on some fine grindstone, that was keen as flame. The snow sprinted on either side, like sparks from a blade that is being sharpened, the whiteness round about ran swifter, swifter, in pure flame the white slope flew against her, and she fused like one molten, dancing globule, rushed through a white intensity. Then there was a great swerve at the bottom, when they swung as it were in a fall to earth, in the diminishing motion.
当他们冲下陡峭的斜坡时，她抓住了他。她感觉自己的感官仿佛被一块细磨石磨砺着，如同火焰般敏锐。雪花从两边冲刺，就像磨刀的火花，周围的白色跑得越来越快，越来越快，白色的斜坡在纯粹的火焰中飞向她，她像一个融化的、舞动的小球一样融合在一起，冲过一片白色。强度。然后在底部发生了一个巨大的转弯，当它们摆动时，就像坠落到地面上一样，运动逐渐减弱。

They came to rest. But when she rose to her feet, she could not stand. She gave a strange cry, turned and clung to him, sinking her face on his breast, fainting in him. Utter oblivion came over her, as she lay for a few moments abandoned against him.
他们来休息了。但当她站起来时，她却站不住了。她发出一声奇怪的叫声，转过身来，紧紧地抱住他，把脸埋在他的胸前，在他怀里昏了过去。她完全被遗忘了，她被遗弃在他身边躺了一会儿。

‘What is it?’ he was saying. ‘Was it too much for you?’
“这是什么？”他问道。 “这对你来说太过分了吗？”

But she heard nothing.
但她什么也没听到。

When she came to, she stood up and looked round, astonished. Her face was white, her eyes brilliant and large.
当她醒过来时，她站了起来，环顾四周，惊讶不已。她的脸色苍白，眼睛很大，明亮。

‘What is it?’ he repeated. ‘Did it upset you?’
“那是什么？”他重复道。 “这让你心烦意乱吗？”

She looked at him with her brilliant eyes that seemed to have undergone some transfiguration, and she laughed, with a terrible merriment.
她用那双明亮的眼睛看着他，那双眼睛似乎已经变形了，她笑了，笑得可怕。

‘No,’ she cried, with triumphant joy. ‘It was the complete moment of my life.’
“不，”她带着胜利的喜悦喊道。 “这是我生命中完整的时刻。”

And she looked at him with her dazzling, overweening laughter, like one possessed. A fine blade seemed to enter his heart, but he did not care, or take any notice.
她用令人眼花缭乱、傲慢的笑声看着他，就像着魔了一样。仿佛有一把细刃刺入了他的心脏，但他并没有在意，也没有在意。

But they climbed up the slope again, and they flew down through the white flame again, splendidly, splendidly. Gudrun was laughing and flashing, powdered with snow-crystals, Gerald worked perfectly. He felt he could guide the toboggan to a hair-breadth, almost he could make it pierce into the air and right into the very heart of the sky. It seemed to him the flying sledge was but his strength spread out, he had but to move his arms, the motion was his own. They explored the great slopes, to find another slide. He felt there must be something better than they had known. And he found what he desired, a perfect long, fierce sweep, sheering past the foot of a rock and into the trees at the base. It was dangerous, he knew. But then he knew also he would direct the sledge between his fingers.
但他们又爬上了斜坡，又从白色的火焰中飞了下来，辉煌，辉煌。古德伦笑着，闪闪发亮，身上撒满了雪晶，杰拉尔德表现得非常完美。他觉得自己可以把雪橇引导到头发丝般的宽度，几乎可以让它刺入空气，直入天空的中心。在他看来，飞橇只是他的力量分散的结果，他只需移动手臂，动作就是他自己的。他们探索了巨大的斜坡，寻找另一条滑道。他觉得一定有比他们所知道的更好的事情。他找到了他想要的东西，一次完美的长而猛烈的扫掠，穿过岩石的脚部，进入底部的树林。这很危险，他知道。但随后他也知道他会用手指操控雪橇。

The first days passed in an ecstasy of physical motion, sleighing, skiing, skating, moving in an intensity of speed and white light that surpassed life itself, and carried the souls of the human beings beyond into an inhuman abstraction of velocity and weight and eternal, frozen snow.
最初的日子在身体运动的狂喜中过去了，雪橇、滑雪、滑冰，以超越生命本身的速度和白光强度移动，并将人类的灵魂带到了速度、重量和永恒的非人性抽象中。 ，冰冻的雪。

Gerald’s eyes became hard and strange, and as he went by on his skis he was more like some powerful, fateful sigh than a man, his muscles elastic in a perfect, soaring trajectory, his body projected in pure flight, mindless, soulless, whirling along one perfect line of force.
杰拉尔德的眼神变得冷酷而奇怪，当他骑着滑雪板走过时，他更像是某种强有力的、命运般的叹息，而不是一个人，他的肌肉在完美的、翱翔的轨迹上有弹性，他的身体投射出纯粹的飞行，无意识、无灵魂、旋转沿着一条完美的力线。

Luckily there came a day of snow, when they must all stay indoors: otherwise Birkin said, they would all lose their faculties, and begin to utter themselves in cries and shrieks, like some strange, unknown species of snow-creatures.
幸运的是，下雪的日子到来了，那时他们都必须待在室内：否则伯金说，他们都会失去自己的能力，并开始发出哭泣和尖叫声，就像一些奇怪的、未知的雪生物一样。

It happened in the afternoon that Ursula sat in the Reunionsaal talking to Loerke. The latter had seemed unhappy lately. He was lively and full of mischievous humour, as usual.
下午，乌苏拉坐在留尼旺大厅里与洛克交谈。后者最近似乎不太高兴。他像往常一样活泼，充满调皮的幽默感。

But Ursula had thought he was sulky about something. His partner, too, the big, fair, good-looking youth, was ill at ease, going about as if he belonged to nowhere, and was kept in some sort of subjection, against which he was rebelling.
但乌苏拉以为他因为什么事情而生闷气。他的伴侣，那个高大、白皙、英俊的年轻人，也感到不安，走来走去，好像他不属于任何地方，并且受到某种服从，他正在反抗这种服从。

Loerke had hardly talked to Gudrun. His associate, on the other hand, had paid her constantly a soft, over-deferential attention. Gudrun wanted to talk to Loerke. He was a sculptor, and she wanted to hear his view of his art. And his figure attracted her. There was the look of a little wastrel about him, that intrigued her, and an old man’s look, that interested her, and then, beside this, an uncanny singleness, a quality of being by himself, not in contact with anybody else, that marked out an artist to her. He was a chatterer, a magpie, a maker of mischievous word-jokes, that were sometimes very clever, but which often were not. And she could see in his brown, gnome’s eyes, the black look of inorganic misery, which lay behind all his small buffoonery.
洛克几乎没有和古德伦说过话。另一方面，他的同事却一直对她表现出温柔、过度恭敬的关注。古德伦想和洛克谈谈。他是一位雕塑家，她想听听他对自己的艺术的看法。而他的身影也吸引了她。他身上有一种小浪子的样子，让她着迷，还有一种老人的样子，让她感兴趣，除此之外，还有一种不可思议的孤独，一种独来独往的品质，不与任何人接触，这让她很感兴趣。为她指定了一位艺术家。他是一个喋喋不休的人，一只喜鹊，一个爱恶作剧的笑话制造者，这些笑话有时很聪明，但往往并不聪明。她可以在他棕色的侏儒眼睛里看到无机痛苦的黑色表情，这隐藏在他所有小滑稽的背后。

His figure interested her—the figure of a boy, almost a street arab. He made no attempt to conceal it. He always wore a simple loden suit, with knee breeches. His legs were thin, and he made no attempt to disguise the fact: which was of itself remarkable, in a German. And he never ingratiated himself anywhere, not in the slightest, but kept to himself, for all his apparent playfulness.
她对他的身材很感兴趣——一个男孩的身材，几乎是一个街头阿拉伯人。他并没有试图隐瞒这一点。他总是穿着一套简单的洛登呢西装，搭配及膝马裤。他的腿很细，而且他并没有试图掩饰这个事实：对于一个德国人来说，这本身就很了不起。他从不去任何地方讨好自己，一点也不，但他总是独来独往，尽管他表面上很顽皮。

Leitner, his companion, was a great sportsman, very handsome with his big limbs and his blue eyes. Loerke would go toboganning or skating, in little snatches, but he was indifferent. And his fine, thin nostrils, the nostrils of a pure-bred street arab, would quiver with contempt at Leitner’s splothering gymnastic displays. It was evident that the two men who had travelled and lived together, sharing the same bedroom, had now reached the stage of loathing. Leitner hated Loerke with an injured, writhing, impotent hatred, and Loerke treated Leitner with a fine-quivering contempt and sarcasm. Soon the two would have to go apart.
他的同伴莱特纳是一位伟大的运动员，有着粗大的四肢和蓝色的眼睛，非常英俊。洛克会时不时地去平底雪橇或滑冰，但他对此漠不关心。他那细细的鼻孔，纯种街头阿拉伯人的鼻孔，会因莱特纳的体操表演而轻蔑地颤抖。显然，这两个一起旅行、一起生活、同住一间卧室的男人，现在已经到了厌恶的地步。莱特纳以一种受伤的、痛苦的、无力的仇恨来憎恨洛尔克，而洛尔克则以一种微微颤抖的蔑视和讽刺来对待莱特纳。很快两人就不得不分开了。

Already they were rarely together. Leitner ran attaching himself to somebody or other, always deferring, Loerke was a good deal alone. Out of doors he wore a Westphalian cap, a close brown-velvet head with big brown velvet flaps down over his ears, so that he looked like a lop-eared rabbit, or a troll. His face was brown-red, with a dry, bright skin, that seemed to crinkle with his mobile expressions. His eyes were arresting—brown, full, like a rabbit’s, or like a troll’s, or like the eyes of a lost being, having a strange, dumb, depraved look of knowledge, and a quick spark of uncanny fire. Whenever Gudrun had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive, looking at her with his watchful dark eyes, but entering into no relation with her. He had made her feel that her slow French and her slower German, were hateful to him. As for his own inadequate English, he was much too awkward to try it at all. But he understood a good deal of what was said, nevertheless. And Gudrun, piqued, left him alone.
他们已经很少在一起了。莱特纳总是依附于某人或其他人，总是推迟，而洛尔克则独自一人。在户外，他戴着一顶威斯特伐利亚帽子，头上戴着一顶紧密的棕色天鹅绒帽子，棕色天鹅绒的大片垂下来盖住耳朵，这样他看起来就像一只垂耳兔，或者是一个巨魔。他的脸呈棕红色，皮肤干燥而明亮，随着他移动的表情，皮肤似乎出现皱纹。他的眼睛很引人注目——棕色的，饱满的，像兔子的眼睛，或者像巨魔的眼睛，或者像迷失者的眼睛，有一种奇怪的、愚蠢的、堕落的知识神情，以及快速闪烁的不可思议的火焰。每当古德伦试图和他说话时，他都会回避，没有任何反应，用警惕的黑眼睛看着她，但与她没有任何关系。他让她觉得他讨厌她那慢吞吞的法语和慢吞吞的德语。至于他自己的英语不够好，他根本就不敢尝试。但尽管如此，他还是听懂了很多内容。古德伦很生气，没有理睬他。

This afternoon, however, she came into the lounge as he was talking to Ursula. His fine, black hair somehow reminded her of a bat, thin as it was on his full, sensitive-looking head, and worn away at the temples. He sat hunched up, as if his spirit were bat-like. And Gudrun could see he was making some slow confidence to Ursula, unwilling, a slow, grudging, scanty self-revelation. She went and sat by her sister.
然而，今天下午，当他正在与乌苏拉交谈时，她走进了休息室。他那细密的黑发不知何故让她想起了一只蝙蝠，虽然他那饱满而敏感的脑袋上的头发很稀疏，但太阳穴处已经磨损了。他弓着身子坐着，精神就像蝙蝠一样。古德伦看得出来，他正在慢慢地向乌苏拉展现信心，不情愿，缓慢、不情愿、很少的自我表露。她走过去坐在她姐姐身边。

He looked at her, then looked away again, as if he took no notice of her. But as a matter of fact, she interested him deeply.
他看了她一眼，然后又移开视线，仿佛根本没有注意到她。但事实上，她对他很感兴趣。

‘Isn’t it interesting, Prune,’ said Ursula, turning to her sister, ‘Herr Loerke is doing a great frieze for a factory in Cologne, for the outside, the street.’
“这不是很有趣吗，普鲁恩，”乌苏​​拉转向她的妹妹说，“洛克先生正在为科隆的一家工厂、外面的街道做一个很棒的饰带。”

She looked at him, at his thin, brown, nervous hands, that were prehensile, and somehow like talons, like ‘griffes,’ inhuman.
她看着他，看着他那双瘦弱的、棕色的、紧张的手，那双手可以抓握，不知何故就像爪子，就像“爪子”，不近人情。

‘What IN?’ she asked.
“什么？”她问。

‘AUS WAS?’ repeated Ursula.
“澳大利亚是吗？”乌苏拉重复道。

‘GRANIT,’ he replied.
“花岗岩，”他回答道。

It had become immediately a laconic series of question and answer between fellow craftsmen.
这立刻就变成了工匠们之间一系列简洁的问答。

‘What is the relief?’ asked Gudrun.
“什么是缓解？”古德伦问。

‘Alto relievo.’
“中音舒缓。”

‘And at what height?’
“那么在什么高度呢？”

It was very interesting to Gudrun to think of his making the great granite frieze for a great granite factory in Cologne. She got from him some notion of the design. It was a representation of a fair, with peasants and artisans in an orgy of enjoyment, drunk and absurd in their modern dress, whirling ridiculously in roundabouts, gaping at shows, kissing and staggering and rolling in knots, swinging in swing-boats, and firing down shooting galleries, a frenzy of chaotic motion.
古德伦想到他为科隆一家伟大的花岗岩工厂制作巨大的花岗岩饰带，感到非常有趣。她从他那里得到了一些设计理念。这是一场集市的再现，农民和工匠沉浸在欢乐的狂欢中，穿着现代服装，醉醺醺、荒唐可笑，在环形交叉路口可笑地旋转，目瞪口呆地观看表演，接吻、摇摇晃晃、打着结打滚，在秋千船上摇摆，向射击场开火，混乱的运动。

There was a swift discussion of technicalities. Gudrun was very much impressed.
双方就技术细节进行了迅速讨论。古德伦印象非常深刻。

‘But how wonderful, to have such a factory!’ cried Ursula. ‘Is the whole building fine?’
“但是拥有这样一家工厂真是太棒了！”乌苏拉喊道。 “整栋楼还好吗？”

‘Oh yes,’ he replied. ‘The frieze is part of the whole architecture. Yes, it is a colossal thing.’
“哦，是的，”他回答道。 “楣板是整个建筑的一部分。是的，这是一件巨大的事情。

Then he seemed to stiffen, shrugged his shoulders, and went on:
然后他似乎身体僵硬了，耸了耸肩，继续说道：

‘Sculpture and architecture must go together. The day for irrelevant statues, as for wall pictures, is over. As a matter of fact sculpture is always part of an architectural conception. And since churches are all museum stuff, since industry is our business, now, then let us make our places of industry our art—our factory-area our Parthenon, ECCO!’
“雕塑和建筑必须结合在一起。无关雕像和壁画的日子已经结束了。事实上，雕塑始终是建筑概念的一部分。既然教堂都是博物馆的东西，既然工业是我们的生意，那么现在，让我们把我们的工业场所变成我们的艺术——我们的工厂区我们的帕台农神庙，ECCO！

Ursula pondered.
乌苏拉沉思着。

‘I suppose,’ she said, ‘there is no NEED for our great works to be so hideous.’
“我想，”她说，“我们的伟大作品没有必要如此丑陋。”

Instantly he broke into motion.
他立即行动起来。

‘There you are!’ he cried, ‘there you are! There is not only NO NEED for our places of work to be ugly, but their ugliness ruins the work, in the end. Men will not go on submitting to such intolerable ugliness. In the end it will hurt too much, and they will wither because of it. And this will wither the WORK as well. They will think the work itself is ugly: the machines, the very act of labour. Whereas the machinery and the acts of labour are extremely, maddeningly beautiful. But this will be the end of our civilisation, when people will not work because work has become so intolerable to their senses, it nauseates them too much, they would rather starve. THEN we shall see the hammer used only for smashing, then we shall see it. Yet here we are—we have the opportunity to make beautiful factories, beautiful machine-houses—we have the opportunity—‘
“你在那儿！”他喊道，“你在那儿！”我们的工作场所不仅不需要丑陋，而且它们的丑陋最终会毁掉工作。男人不会继续屈服于这种难以忍受的丑陋。最终会伤得太深，他们也会因此而枯萎。这也会让工作枯萎。他们会认为工作本身是丑陋的：机器，劳动行为本身。而机器和劳动行为却极其美丽，令人疯狂。但这将是我们文明的终结，届时人们将不再工作，因为工作对他们的感官来说变得如此难以忍受，它让他们感到太恶心，他们宁愿挨饿。然后我们就会看到锤子只用于粉碎，然后我们就会看到它。然而我们在这里——我们有机会建造美丽的工厂、美丽的机器房——我们有机会——”

Gudrun could only partly understand. She could have cried with vexation.
古德伦只能部分理解。她可能会气得哭出来。

‘What does he say?’ she asked Ursula. And Ursula translated, stammering and brief. Loerke watched Gudrun’s face, to see her judgment.
“他说什么？”她问乌苏拉。乌苏拉进行了翻译，结巴而简短。洛克看着古德伦的脸，想看看她的判断。

‘And do you think then,’ said Gudrun, ‘that art should serve industry?’
“那你认为，”古德伦说，“艺术应该为工业服务吗？”

‘Art should INTERPRET industry, as art once interpreted religion,’ he said.
“艺术应该解释工业，就像艺术曾经解释宗教一样，”他说。

‘But does your fair interpret industry?’ she asked him.
“但是你们的展会解释工业吗？”她问他。

‘Certainly. What is man doing, when he is at a fair like this? He is fulfilling the counterpart of labour—the machine works him, instead of he the machine. He enjoys the mechanical motion, in his own body.’
'当然。当一个人在这样的集市上时，他在做什么？他正在完成劳动的对应部分——机器为他工作，而不是他为机器工作。他喜欢自己身体里的机械运动。”

‘But is there nothing but work—mechanical work?’ said Gudrun.
“但是除了工作——机械工作之外就没有别的东西了吗？”古德伦说。

‘Nothing but work!’ he repeated, leaning forward, his eyes two darknesses, with needle-points of light. ‘No, it is nothing but this, serving a machine, or enjoying the motion of a machine—motion, that is all. You have never worked for hunger, or you would know what god governs us.’
“除了工作，什么都没有！”他重复道，身子前倾，双眼漆黑，闪烁着针尖的光芒。 ‘不，无非就是这个，为机器服务，或者享受机器的运动——运动，仅此而已。你从来没有为饥饿而工作过，否则你就会知道上帝在统治我们。”

Gudrun quivered and flushed. For some reason she was almost in tears.
古德伦浑身颤抖，脸红了。不知为什么，她几乎要哭了。

‘No, I have not worked for hunger,’ she replied, ‘but I have worked!’
“不，我没有为了饥饿而工作，”她回答道，“但我已经工作了！”

‘Travaille—lavorato?’ he asked. ‘E che lavoro—che lavoro? Quel travail est-ce que vous avez fait?’
“Travaille——lavorato？”他问道。 ‘E che lavoro——che lavoro？ Quel travail est-ce que vous avez fait?’

He broke into a mixture of Italian and French, instinctively using a foreign language when he spoke to her.
当他和她说话时，他本能地使用了一种外语，混合着意大利语和法语。

‘You have never worked as the world works,’ he said to her, with sarcasm.
“你从来没有像世界那样工作过，”他讽刺地对她说。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘I have. And I do—I work now for my daily bread.’
“是的，”她说。 '我有。我确实这么做了——我现在为我的日常面包而工作。

He paused, looked at her steadily, then dropped the subject entirely. She seemed to him to be trifling.
他停了下来，定定地看着她，然后彻底放弃了这个话题。在他看来，她是微不足道的。

‘But have YOU ever worked as the world works?’ Ursula asked him.
“但是你曾经像世界一样工作过吗？”乌苏拉问他。

He looked at her untrustful.
他不信任地看着她。

‘Yes,’ he replied, with a surly bark. ‘I have known what it was to lie in bed for three days, because I had nothing to eat.’
“是的，”他阴沉地咆哮着回答。 “我知道在床上躺三天是什么感觉，因为我没有东西吃。”

Gudrun was looking at him with large, grave eyes, that seemed to draw the confession from him as the marrow from his bones. All his nature held him back from confessing. And yet her large, grave eyes upon him seemed to open some valve in his veins, and involuntarily he was telling.
古德伦用一双严肃的大眼睛看着他，那双眼睛仿佛从他的骨头里汲取了骨髓一样，从他身上汲取着忏悔。他的本性阻止了他坦白。然而她那双严肃的大眼睛似乎打开了他血管中的某个阀门，他不由自主地说道。

‘My father was a man who did not like work, and we had no mother. We lived in Austria, Polish Austria. How did we live? Ha!—somehow! Mostly in a room with three other families—one set in each corner—and the W.C. in the middle of the room—a pan with a plank on it—ha! I had two brothers and a sister—and there might be a woman with my father. He was a free being, in his way—would fight with any man in the town—a garrison town—and was a little man too. But he wouldn’t work for anybody—set his heart against it, and wouldn’t.’
“我的父亲是一个不喜欢工作的人，而且我们没有母亲。我们住在奥地利，波兰奥地利。我们过得怎么样？哈！——不知何故！大部分时间是在一个房间里，还有另外三个家庭——每个角落都有一个——还有厕所。房间中央——一个平底锅，上面有一块木板——哈！我有两个兄弟和一个姐妹——我父亲身边可能还有一个女人。以他的方式，他是一个自由的人——可以与镇上的任何人战斗——一个驻军城镇——而且也是一个小个子。但他不会为任何人工作——他一心反对，也不会。”

‘And how did you live then?’ asked Ursula.
“那你当时过着怎样的生活呢？”乌苏拉问道。

He looked at her—then, suddenly, at Gudrun.
他看着她——然后突然又看着古珍。

‘Do you understand?’ he asked.
“你明白吗？”他问。

‘Enough,’ she replied.
“够了，”她回答道。

Their eyes met for a moment. Then he looked away. He would say no more.
他们的目光相遇了一会儿。然后他移开视线。他不会再说了。

‘And how did you become a sculptor?’ asked Ursula.
“你是怎么成为一名雕塑家的？”乌苏拉问道。

‘How did I become a sculptor—‘ he paused. ‘Dunque—‘ he resumed, in a changed manner, and beginning to speak French—‘I became old enough—I used to steal from the market-place. Later I went to work—imprinted the stamp on clay bottles, before they were baked. It was an earthenware-bottle factory. There I began making models. One day, I had had enough. I lay in the sun and did not go to work. Then I walked to Munich—then I walked to Italy—begging, begging everything.’
“我是怎么成为一名雕塑家的——”他停顿了一下。 “邓克——”他换了一种方式继续说道，开始说法语——“我已经够老了——我过去常常从市场上偷东西。后来我开始工作——在粘土瓶烘烤之前将印记印在它们上。那是一家陶瓶厂。在那里我开始制作模型。有一天，我受够了。我躺在阳光下，没有去上班。然后我步行到慕尼黑，然后我步行到意大利，乞讨，乞求一切。

‘The Italians were very good to me—they were good and honourable to me. From Bozen to Rome, almost every night I had a meal and a bed, perhaps of straw, with some peasant. I love the Italian people, with all my heart.
“意大利人对我很好——他们对我很好而且很光荣。从博曾到罗马，几乎每天晚上我都会和一些农民一起吃饭，睡一张床，也许是稻草铺的。我全心全意地爱意大利人民。

‘Dunque, adesso—maintenant—I earn a thousand pounds in a year, or I earn two thousand—‘
“邓克，阿德索——维护者——我一年挣一千英镑，或者我挣两千英镑——”

He looked down at the ground, his voice tailing off into silence.
他低头看着地面，声音逐渐变得沉默。

Gudrun looked at his fine, thin, shiny skin, reddish-brown from the sun, drawn tight over his full temples; and at his thin hair—and at the thick, coarse, brush-like moustache, cut short about his mobile, rather shapeless mouth.
古德伦看着他纤细、薄而有光泽的皮肤，在阳光的照射下呈现出红棕色，紧绷在他饱满的太阳穴上。还有他稀疏的头发——还有那浓密、粗糙、像刷子一样的小胡子，在他那张活动的、相当不成形的嘴周围剪得很短。

‘How old are you?’ she asked.
“你多大了？”她问。

He looked up at her with his full, elfin eyes startled.
他抬头看着她，那双充满精灵般的眼睛充满了震惊。

‘WIE ALT?’ he repeated. And he hesitated. It was evidently one of his reticencies.
“WIE ALT？”他重复道。他犹豫了。这显然是他的沉默寡言之一。

‘How old are YOU?’ he replied, without answering.
“你多大了？”他回答道，但没有回答。

‘I am twenty-six,’ she answered.
“我二十六岁了，”她回答道。

‘Twenty-six,’ he repeated, looking into her eyes. He paused. Then he said:
“二十六，”他重复道，看着她的眼睛。他停了下来。然后他说：

‘UND IHR HERR GEMAHL, WIE ALT IS ER?’
“根据 IHR GEMAHL 先生，WIE ALT 是 ER 吗？”

‘Who?’ asked Gudrun.
“谁？”古德伦问。

‘Your husband,’ said Ursula, with a certain irony.
“你的丈夫，”乌苏拉带着某种讽刺的口吻说道。

‘I haven’t got a husband,’ said Gudrun in English. In German she answered,
“我没有丈夫，”古德伦用英语说。她用德语回答说：

‘He is thirty-one.’
“他三十一岁了。”

But Loerke was watching closely, with his uncanny, full, suspicious eyes. Something in Gudrun seemed to accord with him. He was really like one of the ‘little people’ who have no soul, who has found his mate in a human being. But he suffered in his discovery. She too was fascinated by him, fascinated, as if some strange creature, a rabbit or a bat, or a brown seal, had begun to talk to her. But also, she knew what he was unconscious of, his tremendous power of understanding, of apprehending her living motion. He did not know his own power. He did not know how, with his full, submerged, watchful eyes, he could look into her and see her, what she was, see her secrets. He would only want her to be herself—he knew her verily, with a subconscious, sinister knowledge, devoid of illusions and hopes.
但洛克正用他那双不可思议的、充满怀疑的眼睛密切注视着。古德伦身上的某些东西似乎与他相符。他真的就像是一个没有灵魂的“小人物”，在人类身上找到了自己的伴侣。但他在他的发现中遭受了痛苦。她也被他迷住了，迷住了，仿佛某种奇怪的生物，一只兔子、一只蝙蝠、一只棕色海豹，开始和她说话了。但她也知道他没有意识到什么，他巨大的理解力，理解她生动的动作。他不知道自己的力量。他不知道如何，用他饱满的、浸没的、警觉的眼睛，他能够看着她，看到她，看到她是什么，看到她的秘密。他只想让她做她自己——他真实地了解她，潜意识里有一种险恶的认识，没有幻想和希望。

To Gudrun, there was in Loerke the rock-bottom of all life. Everybody else had their illusion, must have their illusion, their before and after. But he, with a perfect stoicism, did without any before and after, dispensed with all illusion. He did not deceive himself in the last issue. In the last issue he cared about nothing, he was troubled about nothing, he made not the slightest attempt to be at one with anything. He existed a pure, unconnected will, stoical and momentaneous. There was only his work.
对于古德伦来说，洛克是所有生命的最低点。其他人都有他们的幻觉，也一定有他们的幻觉，他们的之前和之后。但他却以一种完美的坚忍，没有任何前因后果，摒弃了一切幻想。上一期他并没有欺骗自己。在最后一期中，他什么都不关心，他什么也不烦恼，他没有做出任何与任何事情融为一体的尝试。他有一种纯粹、独立的意志，坚忍而短暂。那里只有他的工作。

It was curious too, how his poverty, the degradation of his earlier life, attracted her. There was something insipid and tasteless to her, in the idea of a gentleman, a man who had gone the usual course through school and university. A certain violent sympathy, however, came up in her for this mud-child. He seemed to be the very stuff of the underworld of life. There was no going beyond him.
同样令人好奇的是，他的贫穷和早年生活的堕落如何吸引了她。在她看来，一个绅士、一个按常规完成了中学和大学课程的男人的观念有些平淡无味。然而，她对这个泥娃娃产生了某种强烈的同情。他似乎就是生活地下世界的一部分。没有什么可以超越他。

Ursula too was attracted by Loerke. In both sisters he commanded a certain homage. But there were moments when to Ursula he seemed indescribably inferior, false, a vulgarism.
乌苏拉也被洛克所吸引。他对两姐妹都怀有某种敬意。但有时候，在乌苏拉看来，他显得极其自卑、虚伪、庸俗。

Both Birkin and Gerald disliked him, Gerald ignoring him with some contempt, Birkin exasperated.
伯金和杰拉德都不喜欢他，杰拉德有些轻蔑地无视他，伯金则恼怒不已。

‘What do the women find so impressive in that little brat?’ Gerald asked.
“女人们对这个小家伙的什么印象如此深刻？”杰拉尔德问道。

‘God alone knows,’ replied Birkin, ‘unless it’s some sort of appeal he makes to them, which flatters them and has such a power over them.’
“只有上帝知道，”伯金回答道，“除非他向他们发出某种呼吁，这让他们感到受宠若惊，并对他们有如此大的影响力。”

Gerald looked up in surprise.
杰拉德惊讶地抬起头。

‘DOES he make an appeal to them?’ he asked.
“他向他们发出呼吁了吗？”他问道。

‘Oh yes,’ replied Birkin. ‘He is the perfectly subjected being, existing almost like a criminal. And the women rush towards that, like a current of air towards a vacuum.’
“哦，是的，”伯金回答道。 “他是一个完全服从的存在，几乎像一个罪犯一样存在。女人们冲向那里，就像一股气流冲向真空。

‘Funny they should rush to that,’ said Gerald.
“有趣的是，他们竟然急于这么做，”杰拉尔德说。

‘Makes one mad, too,’ said Birkin. ‘But he has the fascination of pity and repulsion for them, a little obscene monster of the darkness that he is.’
“也会让人生气，”伯金说。 “但他对他们有一种怜悯和厌恶的魅力，他就是一个黑暗的小怪物。”

Gerald stood still, suspended in thought.
杰拉德一动不动地站着，陷入沉思。

‘What DO women want, at the bottom?’ he asked.
“底层女性想要什么？”他问道。

Birkin shrugged his shoulders.
伯金耸耸肩。

‘God knows,’ he said. ‘Some satisfaction in basic repulsion, it seems to me. They seem to creep down some ghastly tunnel of darkness, and will never be satisfied till they’ve come to the end.’
“天知道，”他说。 “在我看来，在基本的排斥中有些满足。”他们似乎沿着可怕的黑暗隧道爬行，直到到达终点才感到满意。”

Gerald looked out into the mist of fine snow that was blowing by. Everywhere was blind today, horribly blind.
杰拉尔德望向窗外飘过的细雪薄雾。今天到处都是瞎子，瞎得可怕。

‘And what is the end?’ he asked.
“结局是什么？”他问道。

Birkin shook his head.
伯金摇摇头。

‘I’ve not got there yet, so I don’t know. Ask Loerke, he’s pretty near. He is a good many stages further than either you or I can go.’
“我还没到那儿，所以我不知道。问问洛克，他就在附近。他比你我都能走得更远。

‘Yes, but stages further in what?’ cried Gerald, irritated.
“是的，但是进一步发展到什么程度呢？”杰拉尔德恼怒地喊道。

Birkin sighed, and gathered his brows into a knot of anger.
伯金叹了口气，愤怒地皱起了眉头。

‘Stages further in social hatred,’ he said. ‘He lives like a rat, in the river of corruption, just where it falls over into the bottomless pit. He’s further on than we are. He hates the ideal more acutely. He HATES the ideal utterly, yet it still dominates him. I expect he is a Jew—or part Jewish.’
“社会仇恨进一步加剧，”他说。 ‘他像一只老鼠一样生活在腐败的河流中，就在它掉入无底坑的地方。他比我们更进一步。他更加厌恶理想。他完全讨厌理想，但理想仍然支配着他。我猜他是犹太人——或者半犹太人。”

‘Probably,’ said Gerald.
“可能吧，”杰拉尔德说。

‘He is a gnawing little negation, gnawing at the roots of life.’
“他是一个令人痛苦的小否定，吞噬着生命的根源。”

‘But why does anybody care about him?’ cried Gerald.
“但是为什么有人关心他呢？”杰拉德喊道。

‘Because they hate the ideal also, in their souls. They want to explore the sewers, and he’s the wizard rat that swims ahead.’
‘因为他们内心深处也憎恨理想。他们想探索下水道，而他就是游在前面的巫师鼠。”

Still Gerald stood and stared at the blind haze of snow outside.
杰拉德仍然站着，盯着外面茫茫的雪雾。

‘I don’t understand your terms, really,’ he said, in a flat, doomed voice. ‘But it sounds a rum sort of desire.’
“我真的不明白你的用语，”他用一种平淡而注定的声音说道。 “但这听起来有点像朗姆酒的欲望。”

‘I suppose we want the same,’ said Birkin. ‘Only we want to take a quick jump downwards, in a sort of ecstasy—and he ebbs with the stream, the sewer stream.’
“我想我们也想要同样的东西，”伯金说。 “只有我们想快速跳下去，带着一种狂喜——他随着溪流、下水道溪流退潮。”

Meanwhile Gudrun and Ursula waited for the next opportunity to talk to Loerke. It was no use beginning when the men were there. Then they could get into no touch with the isolated little sculptor. He had to be alone with them. And he preferred Ursula to be there, as a sort of transmitter to Gudrun.
与此同时，古德伦和乌苏拉等待着下一次与洛克交谈的机会。当人们在那里的时候，这一切就毫无用处了。然后他们就无法再接触到这位孤立的小雕塑家了。他必须单独和他们在一起。他更喜欢乌苏拉在那里，作为古德伦的某种传达者。

‘Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture?’ Gudrun asked him one evening.
“你除了建筑雕塑什么都不做吗？”一天晚上古德伦问他。

‘Not now,’ he replied. ‘I have done all sorts—except portraits—I never did portraits. But other things—‘
“现在不行，”他回答道。 “我画过各种各样的画——除了肖像画——我从来没有画过肖像画。但其他的事情——”

‘What kind of things?’ asked Gudrun.
“什么样的事情？”古德伦问。

He paused a moment, then rose, and went out of the room. He returned almost immediately with a little roll of paper, which he handed to her. She unrolled it. It was a photogravure reproduction of a statuette, signed F. Loerke.
他停顿了一下，然后站起身来，走出了房间。他几乎立刻就回来了，手里拿着一小卷纸，递给了她。她把它展开。这是一座小雕像的凹版复制品，署名 F. Loerke。

‘That is quite an early thing—NOT mechanical,’ he said, ‘more popular.’
“这是很早的事情——不是机械的，”他说，“更受欢迎。”

The statuette was of a naked girl, small, finely made, sitting on a great naked horse. The girl was young and tender, a mere bud. She was sitting sideways on the horse, her face in her hands, as if in shame and grief, in a little abandon. Her hair, which was short and must be flaxen, fell forward, divided, half covering her hands.
小雕像是一个裸体女孩，身材娇小，制作精良，坐在一匹巨大的裸马上。女孩年轻又娇嫩，简直就是个花蕾。她侧坐在马背上，双手捂着脸，仿佛羞愧悲伤，带着一丝遗弃。她的头发很短，一定是亚麻色的，向前垂下来，分开，一半遮住了她的双手。

Her limbs were young and tender. Her legs, scarcely formed yet, the legs of a maiden just passing towards cruel womanhood, dangled childishly over the side of the powerful horse, pathetically, the small feet folded one over the other, as if to hide. But there was no hiding. There she was exposed naked on the naked flank of the horse.
她的四肢年轻而柔嫩。她的双腿刚刚成形，少女的双腿刚刚迈向残忍的女性，幼稚地悬挂在强大的马的侧面，可悲的是，小脚一个一个地叠在一起，好像是为了隐藏。但没有什么可隐藏的。在那里，她赤身裸体地躺在马的裸露的胁腹上。

The horse stood stock still, stretched in a kind of start. It was a massive, magnificent stallion, rigid with pent-up power. Its neck was arched and terrible, like a sickle, its flanks were pressed back, rigid with power.
那匹马一动不动地站着，伸展着身体，有点惊慌失措。这是一匹巨大而雄伟的种马，身体僵硬，充满了压抑的力量。它的脖子呈拱形，可怕，就像一把镰刀，它的侧腹向后压，充满力量。

Gudrun went pale, and a darkness came over her eyes, like shame, she looked up with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. He glanced at her, and jerked his head a little.
古珍的脸色变得苍白，眼睛里一片黑暗，就像羞耻一样，她抬起头，带着某种恳求，几乎像奴隶一样。他看了她一眼，微微摇头。

‘How big is it?’ she asked, in a toneless voice, persisting in appearing casual and unaffected.
“有多大？”她用平淡的声音问道，坚持表现得漫不经心、不做作。

‘How big?’ he replied, glancing again at her. ‘Without pedestal—so high—‘ he measured with his hand—‘with pedestal, so—‘
“有多大？”他回答道，又看了她一眼。 “没有底座——那么高——”他用手测量——“有底座，所以——”

He looked at her steadily. There was a little brusque, turgid contempt for her in his swift gesture, and she seemed to cringe a little.
他定定地看着她。他迅速的动作中流露出对她的一点粗鲁、浮夸的蔑视，而她似乎有点畏缩。

‘And what is it done in?’ she asked, throwing back her head and looking at him with affected coldness.
“那是用什么做的？”她问道，向后仰着头，假装冷酷地看着他。

He still gazed at her steadily, and his dominance was not shaken.
他依然定定地看着她，霸气未动。

‘Bronze—green bronze.’
“青铜——青青铜。”

‘Green bronze!’ repeated Gudrun, coldly accepting his challenge. She was thinking of the slender, immature, tender limbs of the girl, smooth and cold in green bronze.
“青青铜！”古德伦重复道，冷冷地接受了他的挑战。她想到了女孩修长、稚嫩、柔嫩的四肢，青古铜色的光滑而冰冷。

‘Yes, beautiful,’ she murmured, looking up at him with a certain dark homage.
“是的，美丽的，”她低声说道，抬头看着他，脸上带着某种阴暗的敬意。

He closed his eyes and looked aside, triumphant.
他闭上眼睛，看着一旁，一脸得意。

‘Why,’ said Ursula, ‘did you make the horse so stiff? It is as stiff as a block.’
“为什么，”乌苏拉说，“你把马弄得这么僵硬？它像块一样僵硬。

‘Stiff?’ he repeated, in arms at once.
“僵硬？”他立刻抱起手臂重复道。

‘Yes. LOOK how stock and stupid and brutal it is. Horses are sensitive, quite delicate and sensitive, really.’
'是的。看看它是多么的愚蠢、愚蠢和残酷。马很敏感，非常脆弱和敏感，真的。”

He raised his shoulders, spread his hands in a shrug of slow indifference, as much as to inform her she was an amateur and an impertinent nobody.
他抬起肩膀，摊开双手，缓慢地漠然地耸耸肩，仿佛在告诉她，她是个业余爱好者，一个无礼的无名小卒。

‘Wissen Sie,’ he said, with an insulting patience and condescension in his voice, ‘that horse is a certain FORM, part of a whole form. It is part of a work of art, a piece of form. It is not a picture of a friendly horse to which you give a lump of sugar, do you see—it is part of a work of art, it has no relation to anything outside that work of art.’
“Wissen Sie，”他说道，声音里带着一种侮辱性的耐心和居高临下的态度，“那匹马是某种形式，是整个形式的一部分。它是艺术品的一部分，是一种形式。这不是一张你给了一块糖的一匹友好的马的照片，你明白吗——它是一件艺术品的一部分，它与艺术品之外的任何东西都没有关系。

Ursula, angry at being treated quite so insultingly DE HAUT EN BAS, from the height of esoteric art to the depth of general exoteric amateurism, replied, hotly, flushing and lifting her face.
乌苏拉对自己受到如此侮辱性的对待感到愤怒，从深奥艺术的高度到一般通俗业余主义的深度，她愤怒地回答，涨红了脸，抬起了脸。

‘But it IS a picture of a horse, nevertheless.’
“但无论如何，它都是一匹马的照片。”

He lifted his shoulders in another shrug.
他又耸了耸肩。

‘As you like—it is not a picture of a cow, certainly.’
“如你所愿——这当然不是牛的照片。”

Here Gudrun broke in, flushed and brilliant, anxious to avoid any more of this, any more of Ursula’s foolish persistence in giving herself away.
这时，古德伦闯了进来，脸色通红，神采奕奕，急于避免再发生这样的事，再避免乌苏拉愚蠢地坚持暴露自己。

‘What do you mean by ‘it is a picture of a horse?‘‘ she cried at her sister. ‘What do you mean by a horse? You mean an idea you have in YOUR head, and which you want to see represented. There is another idea altogether, quite another idea. Call it a horse if you like, or say it is not a horse. I have just as much right to say that YOUR horse isn’t a horse, that it is a falsity of your own make-up.’
“你说‘这是一张马的照片’是什么意思？”她对姐姐喊道。 ‘你说的马是什么意思？你的意思是你脑子里有一个想法，并且你希望看到它得到体现。完全是另一种想法，完全是另一种想法。如果你愿意，就称它为马，或者说它不是马。我同样有权利说你的马不是马，它是你自己编造的谎言。”

Ursula wavered, baffled. Then her words came.
乌苏拉犹豫不决，困惑不已。然后她的话就来了。

‘But why does he have this idea of a horse?’ she said. ‘I know it is his idea. I know it is a picture of himself, really—‘
“但是他为什么会有马的想法呢？”她说。 “我知道这是他的主意。我知道这是他自己的照片，真的——”

Loerke snorted with rage.
洛克愤怒地哼了一声。

‘A picture of myself!’ he repeated, in derision. ‘Wissen sie, gnadige Frau, that is a Kunstwerk, a work of art. It is a work of art, it is a picture of nothing, of absolutely nothing. It has nothing to do with anything but itself, it has no relation with the everyday world of this and other, there is no connection between them, absolutely none, they are two different and distinct planes of existence, and to translate one into the other is worse than foolish, it is a darkening of all counsel, a making confusion everywhere. Do you see, you MUST NOT confuse the relative work of action, with the absolute world of art. That you MUST NOT DO.’
“我自己的照片！”他嘲笑地重复道。 ‘Wissen sie，gnadige Frau，那是一件艺术作品，一件艺术品。它是一件艺术品，它是一幅空无一物的图画，绝对空无一物。它与它本身无关，它与这个和另一个的日常世界没有关系，它们之间没有联系，绝对没有联系，它们是两个不同且截然不同的存在平面，并将一个转化为另一个比愚蠢更糟糕的是，它使所有的劝告变得黯淡，到处制造混乱。你明白吗，你一定不能将相对的行动作品与绝对的艺术世界混为一谈。你绝对不能这样做。

‘That is quite true,’ cried Gudrun, let loose in a sort of rhapsody. ‘The two things are quite and permanently apart, they have NOTHING to do with one another. I and my art, they have nothing to do with each other. My art stands in another world, I am in this world.’
“确实如此，”古德伦喊道，语气里充满了狂想。 ‘这两件事是完全分开的，永远分开的，它们彼此没有任何关系。我和我的艺术，他们之间没有任何关系。我的艺术站在另一个世界，而我却在这个世界。”

Her face was flushed and transfigured. Loerke who was sitting with his head ducked, like some creature at bay, looked up at her, swiftly, almost furtively, and murmured,
她的脸涨得通红，变了样。洛尔克低着头坐着，就像某种陷入困境的生物，他迅速地、几乎是鬼鬼祟祟地抬头看着她，低声说道：

‘Ja—so ist es, so ist es.’
“Ja——so ist es，so ist es。”

Ursula was silent after this outburst. She was furious. She wanted to poke a hole into them both.
乌苏拉在这次爆发后沉默了。她很生气。她真想在他们俩身上戳个洞。

‘It isn’t a word of it true, of all this harangue you have made me,’ she replied flatly. ‘The horse is a picture of your own stock, stupid brutality, and the girl was a girl you loved and tortured and then ignored.’
“你对我说的这些长篇大论，一点都不是真的。”她断然回答道。 “那匹马是你自己的照片，愚蠢的野蛮行为，而那个女孩是你爱过、折磨过、然后又被忽视的女孩。”

He looked up at her with a small smile of contempt in his eyes. He would not trouble to answer this last charge.
他抬头看着她，眼里带着轻蔑的笑意。他不会费心去回答这最后一项指控。

Gudrun too was silent in exasperated contempt. Ursula WAS such an insufferable outsider, rushing in where angels would fear to tread. But then—fools must be suffered, if not gladly.
古德伦也因为愤怒的轻蔑而沉默了。乌苏拉是一个令人难以忍受的局外人，她冲进了天使不敢涉足的地方。但话说回来——傻瓜们即使不乐意受苦，也必须受苦。

But Ursula was persistent too.
但乌苏拉也很坚持。

‘As for your world of art and your world of reality,’ she replied, ‘you have to separate the two, because you can’t bear to know what you are. You can’t bear to realise what a stock, stiff, hide-bound brutality you ARE really, so you say ‘it’s the world of art.’ The world of art is only the truth about the real world, that’s all—but you are too far gone to see it.’
“至于你的艺术世界和现实世界，”她回答道，“你必须将两者分开，因为你无法忍受知道自己是什么。”你无法忍受意识到自己到底是多么的呆板、僵硬、顽固，所以你说“这是艺术的世界。”艺术的世界只是现实世界的真相，仅此而已——但你除外太远了，看不到它。

She was white and trembling, intent. Gudrun and Loerke sat in stiff dislike of her. Gerald too, who had come up in the beginning of the speech, stood looking at her in complete disapproval and opposition. He felt she was undignified, she put a sort of vulgarity over the esotericism which gave man his last distinction. He joined his forces with the other two. They all three wanted her to go away. But she sat on in silence, her soul weeping, throbbing violently, her fingers twisting her handkerchief.
她脸色苍白，浑身颤抖，神情专注。古德伦和洛克坐在那儿，对她怀着强烈的厌恶之情。演讲一开始就上来的杰拉德也站在那里用完全不赞成和反对的目光看着她。他觉得她有失尊严，她给人类最后的区别的神秘主义增添了一种粗俗。他与另外两人联合起来。他们三个人都希望她走开。但她默默地坐着，她的灵魂在哭泣，剧烈地抽动，她的手指绞着她的手帕。

The others maintained a dead silence, letting the display of Ursula’s obtrusiveness pass by. Then Gudrun asked, in a voice that was quite cool and casual, as if resuming a casual conversation:
其他人保持着死一般的沉默，没有表现出乌苏拉的唐突。然后古德伦用一种相当冷静、随意的声音问道：

‘Was the girl a model?’
“那个女孩是模特吗？”

‘Nein, sie war kein Modell. Sie war eine kleine Malschulerin.’
‘不，是的，战争是模型。 Sie war eine kleine Malschulerin。”

‘An art-student!’ replied Gudrun.
“一个艺术系的学生！”古德伦回答道。

And how the situation revealed itself to her! She saw the girl art-student, unformed and of pernicious recklessness, too young, her straight flaxen hair cut short, hanging just into her neck, curving inwards slightly, because it was rather thick; and Loerke, the well-known master-sculptor, and the girl, probably well-brought-up, and of good family, thinking herself so great to be his mistress. Oh how well she knew the common callousness of it all. Dresden, Paris, or London, what did it matter? She knew it.
她的处境是怎样的！她看到了那个艺术系的女生，身材稚嫩，鲁莽行事，太年轻了，亚麻色的直发剪得很短，垂到脖子上，微微向内弯曲，因为头发比较粗；还有洛尔克，一位著名的雕塑大师，还有那个女孩，她可能出身良好，出身良好，自认为能成为他的情妇真是太棒了。哦，她多么清楚这一切的普遍冷酷无情。德累斯顿、巴黎或伦敦，这有什么关系呢？她知道。

‘Where is she now?’ Ursula asked.
“她现在在哪里？”乌苏拉问。

Loerke raised his shoulders, to convey his complete ignorance and indifference.
洛克耸起肩膀，表达了他完全的无知和冷漠。

‘That is already six years ago,’ he said; ‘she will be twenty-three years old, no more good.’
“那已经是六年前的事了，”他说。 “她就二十三岁了，不再优秀了。”

Gerald had picked up the picture and was looking at it. It attracted him also. He saw on the pedestal, that the piece was called ‘Lady Godiva.’
杰拉尔德拿起照片并看着它。这也吸引了他。他在底座上看到这件作品的名字是“戈黛娃夫人”。

‘But this isn’t Lady Godiva,’ he said, smiling good-humouredly. ‘She was the middle-aged wife of some Earl or other, who covered herself with her long hair.’
“但这不是戈黛娃夫人，”他幽默地微笑着说道。 “她是某个伯爵或其他人的中年妻子，用长发遮住自己。”

‘A la Maud Allan,’ said Gudrun with a mocking grimace.
“莫德·艾伦，”古德伦说道，脸上带着嘲讽的表情。

‘Why Maud Allan?’ he replied. ‘Isn’t it so? I always thought the legend was that.’
“为什么是莫德·艾伦？”他回答道。 ‘不是这样吗？我一直以为传说就是这样。

‘Yes, Gerald dear, I’m quite SURE you’ve got the legend perfectly.’
“是的，亲爱的杰拉尔德，我确信你已经完美地理解了这个传说。”

She was laughing at him, with a little, mock-caressive contempt.
她正在嘲笑他，带着一丝假装爱抚的轻蔑。

‘To be sure, I’d rather see the woman than the hair,’ he laughed in return.
“当然，我更愿意看到女人而不是头发，”他笑着回应道。

‘Wouldn’t you just!’ mocked Gudrun.
“你不就这样吗！”古德伦嘲笑道。

Ursula rose and went away, leaving the three together.
乌苏拉起身走开，留下三人在一起。

Gudrun took the picture again from Gerald, and sat looking at it closely.
古德伦又从杰拉尔德手里接过照片，坐下来仔细地看着它。

‘Of course,’ she said, turning to tease Loerke now, ‘you UNDERSTOOD your little Malschulerin.’
“当然，”她说，现在转而取笑洛尔克，“你了解你的小马尔舒莱林。”

He raised his eyebrows and his shoulders in a complacent shrug.
他扬起眉毛，骄傲地耸耸肩。

‘The little girl?’ asked Gerald, pointing to the figure.
“那个小女孩？”杰拉尔德指着那个人影问道。

Gudrun was sitting with the picture in her lap. She looked up at Gerald, full into his eyes, so that he seemed to be blinded.
古德伦坐在那儿，腿上放着那幅画。她抬头看着杰拉德，目光注视着他的眼睛，他似乎被蒙蔽了。

‘DIDN’T he understand her!’ she said to Gerald, in a slightly mocking, humorous playfulness. ‘You’ve only to look at the feet—AREN’T they darling, so pretty and tender—oh, they’re really wonderful, they are really—‘
“他难道不明白她的意思吗！”她对杰拉尔德说道，语气中带着一丝嘲讽和幽默的俏皮。 “你只要看看脚——不是吗，亲爱的，那么漂亮、那么温柔——哦，它们真的很棒，它们真的——”

She lifted her eyes slowly, with a hot, flaming look into Loerke’s eyes. His soul was filled with her burning recognition, he seemed to grow more uppish and lordly.
她缓缓抬起眼睛，目光灼灼地注视着洛尔克的眼睛。他的灵魂里充满了她灼热的认可，他似乎变得更加傲慢和威严。

Gerald looked at the small, sculptured feet. They were turned together, half covering each other in pathetic shyness and fear. He looked at them a long time, fascinated. Then, in some pain, he put the picture away from him. He felt full of barrenness.
杰拉德看着那双雕刻般的小脚。他们转过身来，半遮着对方，带着可悲的害羞和恐惧。他着迷地看着他们很久。然后，他有些痛苦地把照片收了起来。他感到自己充满了荒芜。

‘What was her name?’ Gudrun asked Loerke.
“她叫什么名字？”古德伦问洛克。

‘Annette von Weck,’ Loerke replied reminiscent. ‘Ja, sie war hubsch. She was pretty—but she was tiresome. She was a nuisance,—not for a minute would she keep still—not until I’d slapped her hard and made her cry—then she’d sit for five minutes.’
“安妮特·冯·韦克，”洛克回忆道。 ‘Ja，sie war hubsch。她很漂亮——但她很烦人。她真是个讨厌鬼——她一分钟都不会安静——直到我狠狠地打了她一巴掌，让她哭了——然后她就坐了五分钟。”

He was thinking over the work, his work, the all important to him.
他在思考工作，他的工作，对他来说最重要的事情。

‘Did you really slap her?’ asked Gudrun, coolly.
“你真的打了她一巴掌吗？”古珍冷静地问道。

He glanced back at her, reading her challenge.
他回头看了她一眼，读出了她的挑战。

‘Yes, I did,’ he said, nonchalant, ‘harder than I have ever beat anything in my life. I had to, I had to. It was the only way I got the work done.’
“是的，我做到了，”他若无其事地说，“比我一生中击败过任何人都更努力。”我必须，我必须。这是我完成工作的唯一方法。

Gudrun watched him with large, dark-filled eyes, for some moments. She seemed to be considering his very soul. Then she looked down, in silence.
古珍用漆黑的大眼睛注视着他好一会儿。她似乎正在考虑他的灵魂。然后她低下头，沉默不语。

‘Why did you have such a young Godiva then?’ asked Gerald. ‘She is so small, besides, on the horse—not big enough for it—such a child.’
“那你为什么要拥有这么年轻的戈黛娃呢？”杰拉德问道。 “此外，她骑在马上还那么小——还不够大——像个孩子。”

A queer spasm went over Loerke’s face.
洛克的脸上出现一种奇怪的痉挛。

‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I don’t like them any bigger, any older. Then they are beautiful, at sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—after that, they are no use to me.’
“是的，”他说。 “我不喜欢它们更大、更老。然后她们就很漂亮了，十六岁、十七岁、十八岁——之后，她们对我就没用了。”

There was a moment’s pause.
停顿了一会儿。

‘Why not?’ asked Gerald.
“为什么不呢？”杰拉尔德问。

Loerke shrugged his shoulders.
洛克耸了耸肩。

‘I don’t find them interesting—or beautiful—they are no good to me, for my work.’
“我不觉得它们有趣——或者美丽——它们对我、对我的工作没有好处。”

‘Do you mean to say a woman isn’t beautiful after she is twenty?’ asked Gerald.
“你的意思是说女人过了二十岁就不再美丽了吗？”杰拉德问道。

‘For me, no. Before twenty, she is small and fresh and tender and slight. After that—let her be what she likes, she has nothing for me. The Venus of Milo is a bourgeoise—so are they all.’
'对我来说，不。二十岁之前的她，娇小清新，娇嫩纤细。之后——让她成为她喜欢的样子吧，她对我来说已经没有什么了。米洛的维纳斯是资产阶级——他们都是资产阶级。”

‘And you don’t care for women at all after twenty?’ asked Gerald.
“二十岁以后你就一点也不关心女人了？”杰拉德问。

‘They are no good to me, they are of no use in my art,’ Loerke repeated impatiently. ‘I don’t find them beautiful.’
“它们对我没有好处，它们对我的艺术没有用，”洛尔克不耐烦地重复道。 “我不觉得它们漂亮。”

‘You are an epicure,’ said Gerald, with a slight sarcastic laugh.
“你是个享乐主义者，”杰拉尔德带着一丝讽刺的笑声说道。

‘And what about men?’ asked Gudrun suddenly.
“那男人呢？”古德伦突然问道。

‘Yes, they are good at all ages,’ replied Loerke. ‘A man should be big and powerful—whether he is old or young is of no account, so he has the size, something of massiveness and—and stupid form.’
“是的，他们在各个年龄段都表现出色，”洛克回答道。 “一个人应该是大而有力的——无论他是老还是年轻都不重要，所以他有尺寸，某种厚重的东西——还有愚蠢的形式。”

Ursula went out alone into the world of pure, new snow. But the dazzling whiteness seemed to beat upon her till it hurt her, she felt the cold was slowly strangling her soul. Her head felt dazed and numb.
乌苏拉独自一人走进纯净的新雪世界。但那耀眼的白色却仿佛向她袭来，刺痛她，她感觉寒冷正在慢慢地窒息她的灵魂。她的头感到茫然和麻木。

Suddenly she wanted to go away. It occurred to her, like a miracle, that she might go away into another world. She had felt so doomed up here in the eternal snow, as if there were no beyond.
突然她想走开。她突然想到自己可能会进入另一个世界，就像一个奇迹。在这永恒的雪地里，她感觉自己注定要失败，仿佛没有什么出路。

Now suddenly, as by a miracle she remembered that away beyond, below her, lay the dark fruitful earth, that towards the south there were stretches of land dark with orange trees and cypress, grey with olives, that ilex trees lifted wonderful plumy tufts in shadow against a blue sky. Miracle of miracles!—this utterly silent, frozen world of the mountain-tops was not universal! One might leave it and have done with it. One might go away.
现在，她奇迹般地突然记起，远处，在她的脚下，是一片漆黑、硕果累累的大地，向南，有大片土地，长满了橘子树和柏树，长满了灰色的橄榄树，冬青树在里面举起了美丽的羽毛簇。蓝天的影子。奇迹中的奇迹！——这个完全寂静、冰冻的山顶世界并不普遍！人们可能会离开它并结束它。一个人可能会离开。

She wanted to realise the miracle at once. She wanted at this instant to have done with the snow-world, the terrible, static ice-built mountain tops. She wanted to see the dark earth, to smell its earthy fecundity, to see the patient wintry vegetation, to feel the sunshine touch a response in the buds.
她想立刻实现这个奇迹。她想在这一刻结束冰雪世界，结束那些可怕的、静止的冰雪山顶。她想看看黑暗的大地，闻一下泥土的肥沃气息，看看耐心的冬季植被，感受阳光对花蕾的反应。

She went back gladly to the house, full of hope. Birkin was reading, lying in bed.
她满怀希望地高兴地回到家。伯金躺在床上看书。

‘Rupert,’ she said, bursting in on him. ‘I want to go away.’
“鲁珀特，”她冲他说道。 '我想离开。'

He looked up at her slowly.
他缓缓抬头看着她。

‘Do you?’ he replied mildly.
“你是吗？”他温和地回答。

She sat by him und put her arms round his neck. It surprised her that he was so little surprised.
她坐在他旁边，用双臂搂住他的脖子。令她惊讶的是，他竟然一点也不感到惊讶。

‘Don’t YOU?’ she asked troubled.
“你不觉得吗？”她困惑地问道。

‘I hadn’t thought about it,’ he said. ‘But I’m sure I do.’
他说：“我没有考虑过这个问题。” “但我确信我会的。”

She sat up, suddenly erect.
她坐了起来，突然挺直身子。

‘I hate it,’ she said. ‘I hate the snow, and the unnaturalness of it, the unnatural light it throws on everybody, the ghastly glamour, the unnatural feelings it makes everybody have.’
“我讨厌它，”她说。 “我讨厌雪，讨厌它的不自然，它给每个人带来的不自然的光芒，它可怕的魅力，它让每个人都有不自然的感觉。”

He lay still and laughed, meditating.
他静静地躺着，笑着，沉思着。

‘Well,’ he said, ‘we can go away—we can go tomorrow. We’ll go tomorrow to Verona, and find Romeo and Juliet, and sit in the amphitheatre—shall we?’
“好吧，”他说，“我们可以走了——我们明天就可以走了。”我们明天去维罗纳，找到罗密欧与朱丽叶，坐在圆形剧场里——可以吗？

Suddenly she hid her face against his shoulder with perplexity and shyness. He lay so untrammelled.
突然，她把脸埋在他的肩上，一脸的困惑和害羞。他就这么无拘无束地躺着。

‘Yes,’ she said softly, filled with relief. She felt her soul had new wings, now he was so uncaring. ‘I shall love to be Romeo and Juliet,’ she said. ‘My love!’
“是的，”她轻声说道，心里充满了宽慰。她感觉自己的灵魂插上了新的翅膀，现在他却如此漠不关心。 “我很想成为罗密欧与朱丽叶，”她说。 '亲爱的！'

‘Though a fearfully cold wind blows in Verona,’ he said, ‘from out of the Alps. We shall have the smell of the snow in our noses.’
“尽管维罗纳刮着可怕的冷风，”他说，“是从阿尔卑斯山吹来的。”我们的鼻子里将会闻到雪的味道。

She sat up and looked at him.
她坐起来看着他。

‘Are you glad to go?’ she asked, troubled.
“你很高兴去吗？”她困惑地问道。

His eyes were inscrutable and laughing. She hid her face against his neck, clinging close to him, pleading:
他的眼神深不可测，带着笑意。她把脸埋在他的脖子上，紧紧地贴着他，哀求道：

‘Don’t laugh at me—don’t laugh at me.’
“别笑我——别笑我。”

‘Why how’s that?’ he laughed, putting his arms round her.
“为什么会这样呢？”他笑道，用双臂搂住她。

‘Because I don’t want to be laughed at,’ she whispered.
“因为我不想被嘲笑，”她低声说道。

He laughed more, as he kissed her delicate, finely perfumed hair.
当他亲吻她精致、芬芳的头发时，他笑得更开心了。

‘Do you love me?’ she whispered, in wild seriousness.
“你爱我吗？”她低声说道，语气极其严肃。

‘Yes,’ he answered, laughing.
“是的，”他笑着回答。

Suddenly she lifted her mouth to be kissed. Her lips were taut and quivering and strenuous, his were soft, deep and delicate. He waited a few moments in the kiss. Then a shade of sadness went over his soul.
突然，她抬起嘴，想要被吻。她的嘴唇绷紧、颤抖、用力，而他的嘴唇柔软、深邃、精致。他在这个吻中等待了一会儿。然后，一股悲伤笼罩了他的灵魂。

‘Your mouth is so hard,’ he said, in faint reproach.
“你的嘴太狠了。”他带着微弱的责备说道。

‘And yours is so soft and nice,’ she said gladly.
“你的又软又漂亮，”她高兴地说。

‘But why do you always grip your lips?’ he asked, regretful.
“但是你为什么总是紧闭嘴唇呢？”他遗憾地问道。

‘Never mind,’ she said swiftly. ‘It is my way.’
“没关系，”她迅速说道。 “这是我的方式。”

She knew he loved her; she was sure of him. Yet she could not let go a certain hold over herself, she could not bear him to question her. She gave herself up in delight to being loved by him. She knew that, in spite of his joy when she abandoned herself, he was a little bit saddened too. She could give herself up to his activity. But she could not be herself, she DARED not come forth quite nakedly to his nakedness, abandoning all adjustment, lapsing in pure faith with him. She abandoned herself to HIM, or she took hold of him and gathered her joy of him. And she enjoyed him fully. But they were never QUITE together, at the same moment, one was always a little left out. Nevertheless she was glad in hope, glorious and free, full of life and liberty. And he was still and soft and patient, for the time.
她知道他爱她；她对他很确定。但她却无法放下对自己的某种控制，她无法忍受他质问她。她为被他所爱而欣喜地放弃了自己。她知道，当她抛弃自己的时候，他虽然很高兴，但也有一点难过。她可以把自己交给他的活动。但她不能做她自己，她不敢完全赤裸裸地面对他的赤裸，放弃一切调整，对他失去纯粹的信仰。她把自己交给了他，或者她抓住了他并从他那里获得了快乐。她非常喜欢他。但他们从来没有完全在一起，在同一时刻，总是有一个人被排除在外。尽管如此，她还是对希望感到高兴，光荣而自由，充满生机和自由。他当时表现得很平静、温柔、耐心。

They made their preparations to leave the next day. First they went to Gudrun’s room, where she and Gerald were just dressed ready for the evening indoors.
他们做好了第二天出发的准备。他们首先去了古德伦的房间，她和杰拉尔德刚刚穿好衣服，准备晚上在室内呆着。

‘Prune,’ said Ursula, ‘I think we shall go away tomorrow. I can’t stand the snow any more. It hurts my skin and my soul.’
“普鲁恩，”乌苏​​拉说，“我想我们明天就走吧。”我再也受不了雪了。它伤害了我的皮肤和灵魂。”

‘Does it really hurt your soul, Ursula?’ asked Gudrun, in some surprise. ‘I can believe quite it hurts your skin—it is TERRIBLE. But I thought it was ADMIRABLE for the soul.’
“这真的伤害了你的灵魂吗，乌苏拉？”古德伦有些惊讶地问道。 “我相信它会伤害你的皮肤——太可怕了。但我认为这对灵魂来说是令人钦佩的。

‘No, not for mine. It just injures it,’ said Ursula.
‘不，不是为了我的。它只会伤害它，”乌苏拉说。

‘Really!’ cried Gudrun.
“真的！”古德伦喊道。

There was a silence in the room. And Ursula and Birkin could feel that Gudrun and Gerald were relieved by their going.
房间里一片寂静。乌苏拉和伯金能感觉到古德伦和杰拉德因为他们的离开而松了口气。

‘You will go south?’ said Gerald, a little ring of uneasiness in his voice.
“你要去南方吗？”杰拉德问道，声音里带着一丝不安。

‘Yes,’ said Birkin, turning away. There was a queer, indefinable hostility between the two men, lately. Birkin was on the whole dim and indifferent, drifting along in a dim, easy flow, unnoticing and patient, since he came abroad, whilst Gerald on the other hand, was intense and gripped into white light, agonistes. The two men revoked one another.
“是的，”伯金说，转身走开。最近，这两个人之间存在着一种奇怪的、难以形容的敌意。自从出国以来，伯金总体上是昏暗而冷漠的，在一种昏暗、轻松的流动中漂流，不引人注意且耐心，而杰拉德则相反，热情而执着于白光，激动人心。两人互相撤销了。

Gerald and Gudrun were very kind to the two who were departing, solicitous for their welfare as if they were two children. Gudrun came to Ursula’s bedroom with three pairs of the coloured stockings for which she was notorious, and she threw them on the bed. But these were thick silk stockings, vermilion, cornflower blue, and grey, bought in Paris. The grey ones were knitted, seamless and heavy. Ursula was in raptures. She knew Gudrun must be feeling VERY loving, to give away such treasures.
杰拉尔德和古德伦对即将离开的两人非常友善，关心他们的安危，就像他们是两个孩子一样。古德伦带着三双她臭名昭著的彩色长袜来到乌苏拉的卧室，她把它们扔在床上。但这些都是厚丝袜，有朱红色、矢车菊蓝色和灰色，是在巴黎买的。灰色的是针织品，无缝且厚重。乌苏拉欣喜若狂。她知道古德伦一定非常有爱心，才把这些宝物送给别人。

‘I can’t take them from you, Prune,’ she cried. ‘I can’t possibly deprive you of them—the jewels.’
“我不能把它们从你身边夺走，普鲁，”她哭道。 “我不可能剥夺你的——珠宝。”

‘AREN’T they jewels!’ cried Gudrun, eyeing her gifts with an envious eye. ‘AREN’T they real lambs!’
“它们不是珠宝吗！”古德伦喊道，用羡慕的眼光看着她的礼物。 “它们不是真正的羔羊吗！”

‘Yes, you MUST keep them,’ said Ursula.
“是的，你必须保留它们，”乌苏拉说。

‘I don’t WANT them, I’ve got three more pairs. I WANT you to keep them—I want you to have them. They’re yours, there—‘
“我不想要它们，我还有三双。”我希望你保留它们——我希望你拥有它们。它们是你的，在那里——”

And with trembling, excited hands she put the coveted stockings under Ursula’s pillow.
她兴奋地用颤抖的双手把那双令人垂涎的长袜放在乌苏拉的枕头下。

‘One gets the greatest joy of all out of really lovely stockings,’ said Ursula.
“人们从非常可爱的长袜中获得最大的快乐，”乌苏拉说。

‘One does,’ replied Gudrun; ‘the greatest joy of all.’
“有一个，”古德伦回答道。 “最大的快乐。”

And she sat down in the chair. It was evident she had come for a last talk. Ursula, not knowing what she wanted, waited in silence.
她坐在椅子上。显然她是来进行最后一次谈话的。乌苏拉不知道自己想要什么，默默地等待着。

‘Do you FEEL, Ursula,’ Gudrun began, rather sceptically, that you are going-away-for-ever, never-to-return, sort of thing?’
“乌苏拉，你有没有感觉到，”古德伦颇为怀疑地说道，你会永远离开，永远不会回来之类的吗？

‘Oh, we shall come back,’ said Ursula. ‘It isn’t a question of train-journeys.’
“哦，我们会回来的，”乌苏拉说。 “这不是火车旅行的问题。”

‘Yes, I know. But spiritually, so to speak, you are going away from us all?’
'是的，我知道。但在精神上，可以这么说，你要离开我们所有人了吗？

Ursula quivered.
乌苏拉颤抖着。

‘I don’t know a bit what is going to happen,’ she said. ‘I only know we are going somewhere.’
“我有点不知道会发生什么，”她说。 “我只知道我们要去某个地方。”

Gudrun waited.
古德伦等待着。

‘And you are glad?’ she asked.
“你很高兴吗？”她问道。

Ursula meditated for a moment.
乌苏拉沉思了一会儿。

‘I believe I am VERY glad,’ she replied.
“我相信我非常高兴，”她回答道。

But Gudrun read the unconscious brightness on her sister’s face, rather than the uncertain tones of her speech.
但古德伦看出了她姐姐脸上无意识的光芒，而不是她说话时不确定的语气。

‘But don’t you think you’ll WANT the old connection with the world—father and the rest of us, and all that it means, England and the world of thought—don’t you think you’ll NEED that, really to make a world?’
“但是你不认为你会想要与世界保持旧有的联系吗——父亲和我们其他人，以及它所意味着的一切，英国和思想世界——你不认为你真的需要它吗？”创造一个世界？

Ursula was silent, trying to imagine.
乌苏拉沉默不语，努力想象。

‘I think,’ she said at length, involuntarily, ‘that Rupert is right—one wants a new space to be in, and one falls away from the old.’
“我认为，”她最后不由自主地说，“鲁珀特是对的——人们想要一个新的空间，而一个人则远离旧的空间。”

Gudrun watched her sister with impassive face and steady eyes.
古珍面无表情、目光坚定地看着她的妹妹。

‘One wants a new space to be in, I quite agree,’ she said. ‘But I think that a new world is a development from this world, and that to isolate oneself with one other person, isn’t to find a new world at all, but only to secure oneself in one’s illusions.’
“我非常同意，人们想要一个新的空间，”她说。 “但我认为新世界是对这个世界的一种发展，将自己与另一个人隔离，根本不是找到一个新世界，而只是将自己固定在自己的幻想中。”

Ursula looked out of the window. In her soul she began to wrestle, and she was frightened. She was always frightened of words, because she knew that mere word-force could always make her believe what she did not believe.
乌苏拉看着窗外。她的灵魂开始挣扎，她感到害怕。她总是害怕言语，因为她知道仅仅言语的力量总能让她相信她不相信的事情。

‘Perhaps,’ she said, full of mistrust, of herself and everybody. ‘But,’ she added, ‘I do think that one can’t have anything new whilst one cares for the old—do you know what I mean?—even fighting the old is belonging to it. I know, one is tempted to stop with the world, just to fight it. But then it isn’t worth it.’
“也许吧，”她对自己和每个人都充满了不信任。 “但是，”她补充道，“我确实认为，一个人不能拥有任何新的东西，而一个人又关心旧的东西——你知道我的意思吗？——甚至与旧的东西作斗争也是属于它的。”我知道，人们很想停下来与世界抗争。但这样就不值得了。

Gudrun considered herself.
古德伦思考着自己。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘In a way, one is of the world if one lives in it. But isn’t it really an illusion to think you can get out of it? After all, a cottage in the Abruzzi, or wherever it may be, isn’t a new world. No, the only thing to do with the world, is to see it through.’
“是的，”她说。 “从某种意义上说，如果一个人生活在这个世界上，他就属于这个世界。但认为自己可以摆脱困境难道不是一种幻想吗？毕竟，阿布鲁齐的小屋，或者无论在哪里，都不是一个新世界。不，对这个世界唯一要做的就是看透它。

Ursula looked away. She was so frightened of argument.
乌苏拉移开了视线。她非常害怕争论。

‘But there CAN be something else, can’t there?’ she said. ‘One can see it through in one’s soul, long enough before it sees itself through in actuality. And then, when one has seen one’s soul, one is something else.’
“但是可能还有别的东西，不是吗？”她说。 ‘一个人可以在灵魂中看透它，在它真正看透自己之前足够长的时间。然后，当一个人看到自己的灵魂时，他就变成了另外一种东西。”

‘CAN one see it through in one’s soul?’ asked Gudrun. ‘If you mean that you can see to the end of what will happen, I don’t agree. I really can’t agree. And anyhow, you can’t suddenly fly off on to a new planet, because you think you can see to the end of this.’
“一个人能在灵魂中看透它吗？”古德伦问道。 “如果你的意思是你可以看到将要发生的事情到底，我不同意。我实在不敢苟同。无论如何，你不能突然飞到一个新的星球，因为你认为你可以看到这一切的结束。

Ursula suddenly straightened herself.
乌苏拉突然直起身子。

‘Yes,’ she said. ‘Yes—one knows. One has no more connections here. One has a sort of other self, that belongs to a new planet, not to this. You’ve got to hop off.’
“是的，”她说。 “是的——有人知道。这里已经没有更多的联系了。一个人有另一种自我，它属于一个新星球，而不是这个星球。你必须下车。

Gudrun reflected for a few moments. Then a smile of ridicule, almost of contempt, came over her face.
古德伦沉思了一会儿。然后她的脸上浮现出一丝嘲讽，几乎是轻蔑的微笑。

‘And what will happen when you find yourself in space?’ she cried in derision. ‘After all, the great ideas of the world are the same there. You above everybody can’t get away from the fact that love, for instance, is the supreme thing, in space as well as on earth.’
“当你发现自己身处太空时会发生什么？”她嘲笑道。 “毕竟，世界上伟大的思想在那里都是一样的。你比所有人都无法摆脱这样一个事实：例如，无论在太空还是在地球上，爱都是至高无上的东西。

‘No,’ said Ursula, ‘it isn’t. Love is too human and little. I believe in something inhuman, of which love is only a little part. I believe what we must fulfil comes out of the unknown to us, and it is something infinitely more than love. It isn’t so merely HUMAN.’
“不，”乌苏拉说，“不是这样的。”爱太人性化了，也太少了。我相信一些非人性的东西，爱只是其中的一小部分。我相信我们必须完成的事情来自于我们的未知，而且它是比爱更无限的东西。它不仅仅是人类。

Gudrun looked at Ursula with steady, balancing eyes. She admired and despised her sister so much, both! Then, suddenly she averted her face, saying coldly, uglily:
古德伦用稳定、平衡的目光看着乌苏拉。她对自己的妹妹，既佩服又鄙视！然后，她突然别过脸，冷冷难看地道：

‘Well, I’ve got no further than love, yet.’
“好吧，除了爱，我什么也没有了。”

Over Ursula’s mind flashed the thought: ‘Because you never HAVE loved, you can’t get beyond it.’
乌苏拉的脑海中闪过一个念头：“因为你从未爱过，所以你无法超越它。”

Gudrun rose, came over to Ursula and put her arm round her neck.
古德伦站起来，走到乌苏拉身边，用手臂搂住她的脖子。

‘Go and find your new world, dear,’ she said, her voice clanging with false benignity. ‘After all, the happiest voyage is the quest of Rupert’s Blessed Isles.’
“去寻找你的新世界吧，亲爱的，”她说，她的声音带着虚假的仁慈。 “毕竟，最快乐的航行就是探索鲁珀特的祝福群岛。”

Her arm rested round Ursula’s neck, her fingers on Ursula’s cheek for a few moments. Ursula was supremely uncomfortable meanwhile. There was an insult in Gudrun’s protective patronage that was really too hurting. Feeling her sister’s resistance, Gudrun drew awkwardly away, turned over the pillow, and disclosed the stockings again.
她的手臂搂着乌苏拉的脖子，手指在乌苏拉的脸颊上停留了一会儿。与此同时，乌苏拉感到非常不舒服。古德伦的保护性庇护带有一种侮辱，实在太伤人了。感受到姐姐的抗拒，古珍尴尬地退开，翻过枕头，再次露出丝袜。

‘Ha—ha!’ she laughed, rather hollowly. ‘How we do talk indeed—new worlds and old—!’
“哈哈哈！”她笑得很空洞。 “我们确实是如何谈论的——新世界和旧世界——！”

And they passed to the familiar worldly subjects.
然后他们转向了熟悉的世俗主题。

Gerald and Birkin had walked on ahead, waiting for the sledge to overtake them, conveying the departing guests.
杰拉尔德和伯金走在前面，等待雪橇追上他们，送走离开的客人。

‘How much longer will you stay here?’ asked Birkin, glancing up at Gerald’s very red, almost blank face.
“你还要在这里待多久？”伯金问道，抬头看着杰拉德那张通红、几乎毫无表情的脸。

‘Oh, I can’t say,’ Gerald replied. ‘Till we get tired of it.’
“哦，我不能说，”杰拉德回答道。 “直到我们厌倦为止。”

‘You’re not afraid of the snow melting first?’ asked Birkin.
“你不怕雪先融化吗？”伯金问。

Gerald laughed.
杰拉尔德笑了。

‘Does it melt?’ he said.
“它会融化吗？”他说。

‘Things are all right with you then?’ said Birkin.
“那么你一切都好吗？”伯金说。

Gerald screwed up his eyes a little.
杰拉德眯起了眼睛。

‘All right?’ he said. ‘I never know what those common words mean. All right and all wrong, don’t they become synonymous, somewhere?’
“好吧？”他说。 “我从来不知道那些常见的词是什么意思。不管是对还是错，它们难道不会在某个地方成为同义词吗？

‘Yes, I suppose. How about going back?’ asked Birkin.
“是的，我想。回去怎么样？”伯金问。

‘Oh, I don’t know. We may never get back. I don’t look before and after,’ said Gerald.
哦，我不知道。我们可能永远不会回来。我不看之前和之后，”杰拉德说。

‘NOR pine for what is not,’ said Birkin.
“也不渴望不存在的东西，”伯金说。

Gerald looked into the distance, with the small-pupilled, abstract eyes of a hawk.
杰拉尔德用鹰般的小瞳孔、心不在焉的眼睛望着远方。

‘No. There’s something final about this. And Gudrun seems like the end, to me. I don’t know—but she seems so soft, her skin like silk, her arms heavy and soft. And it withers my consciousness, somehow, it burns the pith of my mind.’ He went on a few paces, staring ahead, his eyes fixed, looking like a mask used in ghastly religions of the barbarians. ‘It blasts your soul’s eye,’ he said, ‘and leaves you sightless. Yet you WANT to be sightless, you WANT to be blasted, you don’t want it any different.’
'不。这是最后的事情。对我来说，古德伦似乎就结束了。我不知道——但她看起来很柔软，她的皮肤像丝绸一样，她的手臂沉重而柔软。它使我的意识枯萎，不知怎的，它灼烧了我心灵的精髓。”他向前走了几步，凝视着前方，双眼凝视着，看起来就像野蛮人可怕的宗教中使用的面具。 “它会炸毁你灵魂的眼睛，”他说，“让你失明。”然而你想要失明，你想要被炸毁，你不希望它有任何不同。

He was speaking as if in a trance, verbal and blank. Then suddenly he braced himself up with a kind of rhapsody, and looked at Birkin with vindictive, cowed eyes, saying:
他说话时仿佛处于恍惚状态，言语不清，语无伦次。然后他突然以一种狂想曲的方式振作起来，用怨恨、畏惧的眼神看着伯金，说道：

‘Do you know what it is to suffer when you are with a woman? She’s so beautiful, so perfect, you find her SO GOOD, it tears you like a silk, and every stroke and bit cuts hot—ha, that perfection, when you blast yourself, you blast yourself! And then—‘ he stopped on the snow and suddenly opened his clenched hands—‘it’s nothing—your brain might have gone charred as rags—and—‘ he looked round into the air with a queer histrionic movement ‘it’s blasting—you understand what I mean—it is a great experience, something final—and then—you’re shrivelled as if struck by electricity.’ He walked on in silence. It seemed like bragging, but like a man in extremity bragging truthfully.
“你知道和女人在一起的痛苦是什么吗？她是如此美丽，如此完美，你发现她太好了，它像丝绸一样撕裂你，每一个笔触和每一点都灼热——哈，那种完美，当你爆炸自己时，你爆炸自己！然后——”他在雪地上停了下来，突然张开紧握的双手——“没什么——你的大脑可能已经像破布一样烧焦了——然后——”他以一种奇怪的表演动作环顾空中，“它在爆炸——你明白什么我的意思是——这是一次很棒的经历，是最终的结果——然后——你就像被电击一样枯萎了。”他默默地继续前行。看上去像是在吹牛，但却像是一个绝境中的人在真实地吹牛。

‘Of course,’ he resumed, ‘I wouldn’t NOT have had it! It’s a complete experience. And she’s a wonderful woman. But—how I hate her somewhere! It’s curious—‘
“当然，”他继续说，“我不会没有它！”这是一次完整的体验。她是一个很棒的女人。但是——我在某个地方多么讨厌她啊！真奇怪——’

Birkin looked at him, at his strange, scarcely conscious face. Gerald seemed blank before his own words.
伯金看着他，看着他那张奇怪的、几乎没有意识的脸。杰拉德在自己的话面前显得茫然。

‘But you’ve had enough now?’ said Birkin. ‘You have had your experience. Why work on an old wound?’
“但你现在已经受够了吗？”伯金说。 ‘你已经有过你的经历了。为什么要处理旧伤呢？

‘Oh,’ said Gerald, ‘I don’t know. It’s not finished—‘
“噢，”杰拉德说，“我不知道。事情还没结束——’

And the two walked on.
然后两人继续前行。

‘I’ve loved you, as well as Gudrun, don’t forget,’ said Birkin bitterly. Gerald looked at him strangely, abstractedly.
“我爱过你，也爱过古德伦，别忘了，”伯金痛苦地说。杰拉尔德奇怪地、心不在焉地看着他。

‘Have you?’ he said, with icy scepticism. ‘Or do you think you have?’ He was hardly responsible for what he said.
“你有吗？”他带着冰冷的怀疑问道。 “或者你认为你有？”他对自己所说的话几乎不负任何责任。

The sledge came. Gudrun dismounted and they all made their farewell. They wanted to go apart, all of them. Birkin took his place, and the sledge drove away leaving Gudrun and Gerald standing on the snow, waving. Something froze Birkin’s heart, seeing them standing there in the isolation of the snow, growing smaller and more isolated.
雪橇来了。古德伦下了马，他们都告别了。他们都想分开。伯金取代了他的位置，雪橇开走了，留下古德伦和杰拉德站在雪地上挥手。伯金看到他们站在雪地里，变得越来越小，越来越孤立，心里有什么东西冻结了。

CHAPTER XXX
第三章

SNOWED UP
下雪了

When Ursula and Birkin were gone, Gudrun felt herself free in her contest with Gerald. As they grew more used to each other, he seemed to press upon her more and more. At first she could manage him, so that her own will was always left free. But very soon, he began to ignore her female tactics, he dropped his respect for her whims and her privacies, he began to exert his own will blindly, without submitting to hers.
当乌苏拉和伯金离开后，古德伦在与杰拉德的竞争中感到自由。随着他们彼此越来越习惯，他似乎对她施加的压力也越来越大。起初她可以管理他，让自己的意志永远自由。但很快，他开始无视她的女性策略，不再尊重她的奇思妙想和隐私，开始盲目地发挥自己的意志，而不屈服于她的意志。

Already a vital conflict had set in, which frightened them both. But he was alone, whilst already she had begun to cast round for external resource.
一场至关重要的冲突已经开始，这让他们俩都感到害怕。但他孤身一人，而她已经开始四处寻找外部资源。

When Ursula had gone, Gudrun felt her own existence had become stark and elemental. She went and crouched alone in her bedroom, looking out of the window at the big, flashing stars. In front was the faint shadow of the mountain-knot. That was the pivot. She felt strange and inevitable, as if she were centred upon the pivot of all existence, there was no further reality.
乌苏拉离开后，古德伦感觉自己的存在变得赤裸裸、原始。她走过去，独自蹲在卧室里，看着窗外闪烁的大星星。前方隐约可见山结的影子。这就是支点。她感到奇怪和不可避免，仿佛她以一切存在的轴心为中心，没有进一步的现实。

Presently Gerald opened the door. She knew he would not be long before he came. She was rarely alone, he pressed upon her like a frost, deadening her.
不久，杰拉尔德打开了门。她知道他很快就会来。她很少孤单，他像冰霜一样压在她身上，让她变得麻木。

‘Are you alone in the dark?’ he said. And she could tell by his tone he resented it, he resented this isolation she had drawn round herself. Yet, feeling static and inevitable, she was kind towards him.
“黑暗中只有你一个人吗？”他说。从他的语气中她可以看出他对此感到厌恶，他厌恶她给自己带来的这种孤立。然而，由于感觉静止和不可避免，她对他很友善。

‘Would you like to light the candle?’ she asked.
“你想点燃蜡烛吗？”她问。

He did not answer, but came and stood behind her, in the darkness.
他没有回答，而是来到黑暗中站在她身后。

‘Look,’ she said, ‘at that lovely star up there. Do you know its name?’
“看，”她说，“那颗可爱的星星。”你知道它的名字吗？

He crouched beside her, to look through the low window.
他蹲在她身边，透过低矮的窗户往外看。

‘No,’ he said. ‘It is very fine.’
“不，”他说。 “很好。”

‘ISN’T it beautiful! Do you notice how it darts different coloured fires—it flashes really superbly—‘
‘不是很漂亮吗！你有没有注意到它如何射出不同颜色的火焰——它闪烁得非常出色——”

They remained in silence. With a mute, heavy gesture she put her hand on his knee, and took his hand.
他们保持沉默。她以一种无声而沉重的姿势把手放在他的膝盖上，握住了他的手。

‘Are you regretting Ursula?’ he asked.
“你后悔乌苏拉吗？”他问。

‘No, not at all,’ she said. Then, in a slow mood, she asked:
“不，一点也不，”她说。然后，她缓缓问道：

‘How much do you love me?’
'你有多爱我？'

He stiffened himself further against her.
他对她更加僵硬。

‘How much do you think I do?’ he asked.
“你认为我做了多少？”他问道。

‘I don’t know,’ she replied.
“我不知道，”她回答道。

‘But what is your opinion?’ he asked.
“但是你的意见是什么？”他问道。

There was a pause. At length, in the darkness, came her voice, hard and indifferent:
一阵停顿。黑暗中终于传来了她的声音，冷漠而冷漠：

‘Very little indeed,’ she said coldly, almost flippant.
“确实很少，”她冷冷地说，几乎是轻率的。

His heart went icy at the sound of her voice.
听到她的声音，他的心都凉了。

‘Why don’t I love you?’ he asked, as if admitting the truth of her accusation, yet hating her for it.
“我为什么不爱你？”他问道，仿佛承认她指控的真相，但却因此而恨她。

‘I don’t know why you don’t—I’ve been good to you. You were in a FEARFUL state when you came to me.’
“我不知道你为什么不这样做——我一直对你很好。当你来找我时，你正处于一种恐惧的状态。

Her heart was beating to suffocate her, yet she was strong and unrelenting.
她的心脏跳动得快要窒息，但她却很坚强，不屈不挠。

‘When was I in a fearful state?’ he asked.
“我什么时候处于恐惧状态？”他问道。

‘When you first came to me. I HAD to take pity on you. But it was never love.’
‘当你第一次来找我的时候。我不得不可怜你。但这从来都不是爱。

It was that statement ‘It was never love,’ which sounded in his ears with madness.
正是那句“这从来就不是爱情”在他耳边疯狂地响起。

‘Why must you repeat it so often, that there is no love?’ he said in a voice strangled with rage.
“为什么你必须经常重复这句话，说没有爱？”他的声音因愤怒而窒息。

‘Well you don’t THINK you love, do you?’ she asked.
“好吧，你不认为你爱，是吗？”她问。

He was silent with cold passion of anger.
他沉默着，带着冰冷的愤怒。

‘You don’t think you CAN love me, do you?’ she repeated almost with a sneer.
“你认为你不能爱我，是吗？”她几乎带着冷笑重复道。

‘No,’ he said.
“不，”他说。

‘You know you never HAVE loved me, don’t you?’
“你知道你从来没有爱过我，不是吗？”

‘I don’t know what you mean by the word ‘love,’ he replied.
“我不知道你所说的‘爱’这个词是什么意思，”他回答道。

‘Yes, you do. You know all right that you have never loved me. Have you, do you think?’
'是的你是。你很清楚你从来没有爱过我。你认为有吗？

‘No,’ he said, prompted by some barren spirit of truthfulness and obstinacy.
“不，”他说，是出于某种诚实和固执的贫瘠精神。

‘And you never WILL love me,’ she said finally, ‘will you?’
“你永远不会爱我，”她最后说道，“会吗？”

There was a diabolic coldness in her, too much to bear.
她的身上有一股恶魔般的冰冷，让人难以忍受。

‘No,’ he said.
“不，”他说。

‘Then,’ she replied, ‘what have you against me!’
“那么，”她回答道，“你有什么仇视我的！”

He was silent in cold, frightened rage and despair. ‘If only I could kill her,’ his heart was whispering repeatedly. ‘If only I could kill her—I should be free.’
他因寒冷、恐惧、愤怒和绝望而沉默。 “要是我能杀了她就好了。”他的心里不断地低语着。 “如果我能杀了她就好了——我就自由了。”

It seemed to him that death was the only severing of this Gordian knot.
在他看来，死亡是解决这个棘手问题的唯一方法。

‘Why do you torture me?’ he said.
“你为什么折磨我？”他说。

She flung her arms round his neck.
她用双臂搂住他的脖子。

‘Ah, I don’t want to torture you,’ she said pityingly, as if she were comforting a child. The impertinence made his veins go cold, he was insensible. She held her arms round his neck, in a triumph of pity. And her pity for him was as cold as stone, its deepest motive was hate of him, and fear of his power over her, which she must always counterfoil.
“啊，我不想折磨你。”她怜悯地说，就像在安慰一个孩子一样。这无礼让他浑身冰冷，失去了知觉。她用双臂搂住他的脖子，表现出一种怜悯的胜利。她对他的怜悯冷如磐石，最深层的动机是对他的仇恨，以及对他对她的权力的恐惧，而她必须始终抵制这种权力。

‘Say you love me,’ she pleaded. ‘Say you will love me for ever—won’t you—won’t you?’
“说你爱我，”她恳求道。 “说你会永远爱我——不是吗——不是吗？”

But it was her voice only that coaxed him. Her senses were entirely apart from him, cold and destructive of him. It was her overbearing WILL that insisted.
但哄他的只有她的声音。她的感官完全脱离了他，冰冷而具有破坏性。是她霸道的意志在坚持。

‘Won’t you say you’ll love me always?’ she coaxed. ‘Say it, even if it isn’t true—say it Gerald, do.’
“你不是说你会永远爱我吗？”她哄道。 “说出来，即使这不是真的——杰拉尔德，说出来，做吧。”

‘I will love you always,’ he repeated, in real agony, forcing the words out.
“我会永远爱你，”他重复道，在真正的痛苦中，强行说出这句话。

She gave him a quick kiss.
她快速地吻了他一下。

‘Fancy your actually having said it,’ she said with a touch of raillery.
“想象一下你真的说过这句话吧，”她带着一丝嘲讽地说。

He stood as if he had been beaten.
他站着，就像被打了一样。

‘Try to love me a little more, and to want me a little less,’ she said, in a half contemptuous, half coaxing tone.
“试着多爱我一点，少一点想要我。”她用半轻蔑、半哄骗的语气说道。

The darkness seemed to be swaying in waves across his mind, great waves of darkness plunging across his mind. It seemed to him he was degraded at the very quick, made of no account.
黑暗似乎在他的脑海中摇曳，巨大的黑暗波浪席卷了他的脑海。在他看来，他很快就被贬低了，变得无足轻重了。

‘You mean you don’t want me?’ he said.
“你的意思是你不想要我了？”他说。

‘You are so insistent, and there is so little grace in you, so little fineness. You are so crude. You break me—you only waste me—it is horrible to me.’
‘你是如此坚持，但你身上却没有什么优雅，没有什么美德。你太粗鲁了。你毁了我——你只会浪费我——这对我来说太可怕了。

‘Horrible to you?’ he repeated.
“你觉得可怕吗？”他重复道。

‘Yes. Don’t you think I might have a room to myself, now Ursula has gone? You can say you want a dressing room.’
'是的。现在乌苏拉走了，你不认为我可能有一个自己的房间吗？你可以说你想要一个更衣室。

‘You do as you like—you can leave altogether if you like,’ he managed to articulate.
“你想怎么做就怎么做——如果你愿意的话，你可以完全离开，”他设法阐明道。

‘Yes, I know that,’ she replied. ‘So can you. You can leave me whenever you like—without notice even.’
“是的，我知道，”她回答道。 ‘你也可以。你可以随时离开我——甚至无需通知。

The great tides of darkness were swinging across his mind, he could hardly stand upright. A terrible weariness overcame him, he felt he must lie on the floor. Dropping off his clothes, he got into bed, and lay like a man suddenly overcome by drunkenness, the darkness lifting and plunging as if he were lying upon a black, giddy sea. He lay still in this strange, horrific reeling for some time, purely unconscious.
黑暗的巨浪在他的脑海中翻腾，他几乎无法站直。一种可怕的疲倦袭上他的心头，他觉得自己必须躺在地板上。他脱掉衣服，上了床，像一个突然喝醉了的人一样躺着，黑暗忽高忽低，仿佛他躺在一片漆黑、令人晕眩的大海上。他在这种奇怪的、可怕的摇晃中一动不动地躺了一段时间，完全失去了知觉。

At length she slipped from her own bed and came over to him. He remained rigid, his back to her. He was all but unconscious.
最后，她从自己的床上溜下来，来到他身边。他依然僵硬，背对着她。他几乎失去知觉。

She put her arms round his terrifying, insentient body, and laid her cheek against his hard shoulder.
她用双臂搂住他那可怕的、没有知觉的身体，把脸颊靠在他坚硬的肩膀上。

‘Gerald,’ she whispered. ‘Gerald.’
“杰拉尔德，”她低声说道。 “杰拉德。”

There was no change in him. She caught him against her. She pressed her breasts against his shoulders, she kissed his shoulder, through the sleeping jacket. Her mind wondered, over his rigid, unliving body. She was bewildered, and insistent, only her will was set for him to speak to her.
他身上没有任何变化。她发现他正对着她。她把乳房压在他的肩膀上，隔着睡衣亲吻他的肩膀。她的思绪在他僵硬、没有生命的身体上思考。她很困惑，也很坚持，只有她的意愿是让他跟她说话。

‘Gerald, my dear!’ she whispered, bending over him, kissing his ear.
“杰拉德，亲爱的！”她低声说道，弯下腰，亲吻他的耳朵。

Her warm breath playing, flying rhythmically over his ear, seemed to relax the tension. She could feel his body gradually relaxing a little, losing its terrifying, unnatural rigidity. Her hands clutched his limbs, his muscles, going over him spasmodically.
她温热的呼吸声，有节奏地在他耳边飞扬，似乎缓解了他紧张的情绪。她能感觉到他的身体渐渐的放松了一些，失去了那可怕的、不自然的僵硬。她的双手抓住他的四肢、他的肌肉，痉挛般地抚摸着他。

The hot blood began to flow again through his veins, his limbs relaxed.
滚烫的血液再次在他的血管中流动，他的四肢放松了。

‘Turn round to me,’ she whispered, forlorn with insistence and triumph.
“转向我，”她低声说道，带着坚持和胜利的绝望。

So at last he was given again, warm and flexible. He turned and gathered her in his arms. And feeling her soft against him, so perfectly and wondrously soft and recipient, his arms tightened on her. She was as if crushed, powerless in him. His brain seemed hard and invincible now like a jewel, there was no resisting him.
所以最后他又被给予了，温暖而灵活。他转身，将她搂在怀里。感觉到她柔软地靠在他身上，如此完美、奇妙的柔软和接纳，他的手臂收紧了她。她就像被压垮了一样，在他心里无能为力。他的大脑现在就像一颗宝石一样坚硬无敌，没有人可以反抗他。

His passion was awful to her, tense and ghastly, and impersonal, like a destruction, ultimate. She felt it would kill her. She was being killed.
他的激情对她来说是可怕的，紧张而可怕，而且没有人情味，就像毁灭一样，最终的。她觉得这会杀了她。她正在被杀。

‘My God, my God,’ she cried, in anguish, in his embrace, feeling her life being killed within her. And when he was kissing her, soothing her, her breath came slowly, as if she were really spent, dying.
“我的上帝，我的上帝，”她在他的怀抱中痛苦地喊道，感觉自己的生命在她体内被杀死了。当他亲吻她、安抚她时，她的呼吸变得缓慢，仿佛她真的精疲力尽、快要死了。

‘Shall I die, shall I die?’ she repeated to herself.
“我要死吗？我要死吗？”她对自己重复道。

And in the night, and in him, there was no answer to the question.
在夜晚，在他心里，这个问题没有答案。

And yet, next day, the fragment of her which was not destroyed remained intact and hostile, she did not go away, she remained to finish the holiday, admitting nothing. He scarcely ever left her alone, but followed her like a shadow, he was like a doom upon her, a continual ‘thou shalt,’ ‘thou shalt not.’ Sometimes it was he who seemed strongest, whist she was almost gone, creeping near the earth like a spent wind; sometimes it was the reverse. But always it was this eternal see-saw, one destroyed that the other might exist, one ratified because the other was nulled.
然而，第二天，她未被摧毁的那部分仍然完好无损，充满敌意，她没有离开，她留下来结束假期，不承认任何事情。他几乎不离开她一个人，而是像影子一样跟着她，他就像她身上的厄运，不断地说“你应该”，“你不应该。”有时，他似乎最坚强，而她几乎消失了，蠕动着靠近大地，如一阵乏力的风；有时情况恰恰相反。但永远都是这种永恒的拉锯，一个摧毁了另一个，因为另一个可能存在，一个批准了，因为另一个被取消了。

‘In the end,’ she said to herself, ‘I shall go away from him.’
“最终，”她对自己说，“我会离开他。”

‘I can be free of her,’ he said to himself in his paroxysms of suffering.
“我可以摆脱她，”他在痛苦的发作中对自己说。

And he set himself to be free. He even prepared to go away, to leave her in the lurch. But for the first time there was a flaw in his will.
他让自己自由了。他甚至准备走开，留下她一个人。但他的意志第一次出现了缺陷。

‘Where shall I go?’ he asked himself.
“我该去哪里？”他问自己。

‘Can’t you be self-sufficient?’ he replied to himself, putting himself upon his pride.
“你就不能自给自足吗？”他自言自语，把自己置于骄傲之中。

‘Self-sufficient!’ he repeated.
“自给自足！”他重复道。

It seemed to him that Gudrun was sufficient unto herself, closed round and completed, like a thing in a case. In the calm, static reason of his soul, he recognised this, and admitted it was her right, to be closed round upon herself, self-complete, without desire. He realised it, he admitted it, it only needed one last effort on his own part, to win for himself the same completeness. He knew that it only needed one convulsion of his will for him to be able to turn upon himself also, to close upon himself as a stone fixes upon itself, and is impervious, self-completed, a thing isolated.
在他看来，古珍一个人就足够了，封闭完整，就像箱子里的一个东西。在他灵魂平静、静止的理性中，他认识到了这一点，并承认她有权利封闭自己、自我完善、没有欲望。他意识到了，他承认了，只需要他自己最后的努力，就可以为自己赢得同样的完整。他知道，只需要他意志的一次抽搐，他就能转向自己，像一块石头固定在自己身上一样封闭自己，并且是不可渗透的、自我完成的、孤立的事物。

This knowledge threw him into a terrible chaos. Because, however much he might mentally WILL to be immune and self-complete, the desire for this state was lacking, and he could not create it. He could see that, to exist at all, he must be perfectly free of Gudrun, leave her if she wanted to be left, demand nothing of her, have no claim upon her.
这些知识让他陷入了可怕的混乱之中。因为，无论他在精神上多么渴望免疫和自我完善，他都缺乏对这种状态的渴望，而且他无法创造它。他看得出来，为了生存，他必须完全摆脱古珍的束缚，如果她想离开，就离开她，对她没有任何要求，对她没有任何要求。

But then, to have no claim upon her, he must stand by himself, in sheer nothingness. And his brain turned to nought at the idea. It was a state of nothingness. On the other hand, he might give in, and fawn to her. Or, finally, he might kill her. Or he might become just indifferent, purposeless, dissipated, momentaneous. But his nature was too serious, not gay enough or subtle enough for mocking licentiousness.
但是，为了对她没有任何要求，他必须独自一人，处于纯粹的虚无之中。他的大脑因为这个想法而变得毫无意义。那是一种虚无的状态。另一方面，他也可能会屈服，向她阿谀奉承。或者，最后，他可能会杀了她。或者他可能会变得冷漠、漫无目的、放荡、短暂。但他的本性太严肃了，不够欢乐，也不够微妙，不足以嘲笑放荡。

A strange rent had been torn in him; like a victim that is torn open and given to the heavens, so he had been torn apart and given to Gudrun. How should he close again? This wound, this strange, infinitely-sensitive opening of his soul, where he was exposed, like an open flower, to all the universe, and in which he was given to his complement, the other, the unknown, this wound, this disclosure, this unfolding of his own covering, leaving him incomplete, limited, unfinished, like an open flower under the sky, this was his cruellest joy. Why then should he forego it? Why should he close up and become impervious, immune, like a partial thing in a sheath, when he had broken forth, like a seed that has germinated, to issue forth in being, embracing the unrealised heavens.
他身上出现了一种奇怪的撕裂；就像一个被撕开并交给天堂的受害者，所以他被撕碎并交给了古德伦。他该如何再次关闭？这个伤口，这个奇怪的，他灵魂的无限敏感的开放，在那里他像一朵开放的花朵一样暴露于整个宇宙，并且在其中他被赋予了他的补充，他者，未知，这个伤口，这个揭露，他自己的覆盖物的展开，让他变得不完整、有限、未完成，就像天空下开放的花朵，这是他最残酷的快乐。那么他为什么要放弃呢？当他像一颗发芽的种子一样破土而出，拥抱未实现的天堂时，为什么要封闭起来，变得不渗透、免疫，就像鞘中的部分东西一样。

He would keep the unfinished bliss of his own yearning even through the torture she inflicted upon him. A strange obstinacy possessed him. He would not go away from her whatever she said or did. A strange, deathly yearning carried him along with her. She was the determinating influence of his very being, though she treated him with contempt, repeated rebuffs, and denials, still he would never be gone, since in being near her, even, he felt the quickening, the going forth in him, the release, the knowledge of his own limitation and the magic of the promise, as well as the mystery of his own destruction and annihilation.
即使她给他带来折磨，他也会保留自己渴望的未完成的幸福。他身上有一种奇怪的固执。无论她说什么或做什么，他都不会离开她。一种奇怪的、致命的渴望带着他和她一起走。她对他的存在有着决定性的影响，尽管她轻蔑地对待他，一再拒绝和否认，但他仍然永远不会离开，因为在她身边，他甚至感到自己的生命在加速，在向前迈进，释放，了解他自己的局限性和承诺的魔力，以及他自己毁灭和湮灭的奥秘。

She tortured the open heart of him even as he turned to her. And she was tortured herself. It may have been her will was stronger. She felt, with horror, as if he tore at the bud of her heart, tore it open, like an irreverent persistent being. Like a boy who pulls off a fly’s wings, or tears open a bud to see what is in the flower, he tore at her privacy, at her very life, he would destroy her as an immature bud, torn open, is destroyed.
即使他转向她，她也折磨着他开放的心。而她自己也受到了折磨。也许是她的意志更加坚强。她惊恐地感觉到，他仿佛撕扯了她心上的花蕾，撕开了它，就像一个不敬的顽固存在。就像一个男孩扯掉苍蝇的翅膀，或者撕开花蕾看看花里有什么一样，他撕裂了她的隐私，在她的生命中，他会毁掉她，就像一个不成熟的花蕾被撕开，被毁掉一样。

She might open towards him, a long while hence, in her dreams, when she was a pure spirit. But now she was not to be violated and ruined. She closed against him fiercely.
很久以后，在她的梦中，当她还是一个纯洁的灵魂时，她可能会向他敞开心扉。但现在她不应该被侵犯和毁掉。她猛烈地向他靠近。

They climbed together, at evening, up the high slope, to see the sunset. In the finely breathing, keen wind they stood and watched the yellow sun sink in crimson and disappear. Then in the east the peaks and ridges glowed with living rose, incandescent like immortal flowers against a brown-purple sky, a miracle, whilst down below the world was a bluish shadow, and above, like an annunciation, hovered a rosy transport in mid-air.
傍晚时分，他们一起爬上高坡，去看日落。在微弱的呼吸声和凛冽的风中，他们站着，看着黄色的太阳在深红色中沉没并消失。然后，东方的山峰和山脊闪烁着生机勃勃的玫瑰色，在棕紫色的天空映衬下，像不朽的花朵一样白炽，这是一个奇迹，而下面的世界是一个蓝色的阴影，上面，像一个天使报喜，在中间盘旋着一个玫瑰色的运输机。 -空气。

To her it was so beautiful, it was a delirium, she wanted to gather the glowing, eternal peaks to her breast, and die. He saw them, saw they were beautiful. But there arose no clamour in his breast, only a bitterness that was visionary in itself. He wished the peaks were grey and unbeautiful, so that she should not get her support from them. Why did she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of the evening? Why did she leave him standing there, with the ice-wind blowing through his heart, like death, to gratify herself among the rosy snow-tips?
对她来说，它是如此美丽，这是一种疯狂，她想将发光的、永恒的山峰聚集在她的胸前，然后死去。他看到了它们，看到它们很美丽。但他的胸中并没有出现任何喧闹，只有一种本身就如幻象般的苦涩。他希望山峰是灰色的、不美丽的，这样她就不会得到山峰的支持。为什么她要如此可怕地背叛两人，拥抱黄昏的光芒？为什么她要留他站在那里，让冰风吹过他的心，如死一般，去在玫瑰色的雪尖上取悦自己？

‘What does the twilight matter?’ he said. ‘Why do you grovel before it? Is it so important to you?’
“黄昏有什么关系？”他说。 ‘你为什么要在它面前卑躬屈膝？这对你来说很重要吗？

She winced in violation and in fury.
她因侵犯和愤怒而皱起眉头。

‘Go away,’ she cried, ‘and leave me to it. It is beautiful, beautiful,’ she sang in strange, rhapsodic tones. ‘It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life. Don’t try to come between it and me. Take yourself away, you are out of place—‘
“走开，”她喊道，“别管我了。”它很美丽，很美丽，”她用奇怪、狂喜的语调唱道。 “这是我一生中见过的最美丽的事情。不要试图介入它和我之间。把你自己拿开，你不合适——”

He stood back a little, and left her standing there, statue-like, transported into the mystic glowing east. Already the rose was fading, large white stars were flashing out. He waited. He would forego everything but the yearning.
他往后退了一点，留下她像雕像一样站在那里，仿佛置身于神秘的、光芒四射的东方。玫瑰花已经凋谢了，白色的大星星开始闪烁。他等了。他愿意放弃一切，除了渴望。

‘That was the most perfect thing I have ever seen,’ she said in cold, brutal tones, when at last she turned round to him. ‘It amazes me that you should want to destroy it. If you can’t see it yourself, why try to debar me?’ But in reality, he had destroyed it for her, she was straining after a dead effect.
“这是我见过的最完美的事情，”当她最后转向他时，她用冷酷、残酷的语气说道。 ‘令我惊讶的是你居然想毁掉它。如果你自己看不到它，为什么要阻止我呢？”但事实上，他已经为她​​毁掉了它，她正在为一种死亡效果而紧张。

‘One day,’ he said, softly, looking up at her, ‘I shall destroy YOU, as you stand looking at the sunset; because you are such a liar.’
“有一天，”他抬头看着她，轻声说道，“当你站着看日落时，我会毁了你；”因为你就是个骗子。

There was a soft, voluptuous promise to himself in the words. She was chilled but arrogant.
话语中充满了对自己温柔而性感的承诺。她冷漠却又傲慢。

‘Ha!’ she said. ‘I am not afraid of your threats!’ She denied herself to him, she kept her room rigidly private to herself. But he waited on, in a curious patience, belonging to his yearning for her.
“哈！”她说。 “我不怕你的威胁！”她向他否认自己，她把自己的房间严格保密。但他出于对她的渴望，以一种奇怪的耐心等待着。

‘In the end,’ he said to himself with real voluptuous promise, ‘when it reaches that point, I shall do away with her.’ And he trembled delicately in every limb, in anticipation, as he trembled in his most violent accesses of passionate approach to her, trembling with too much desire.
“最后，”他用真正的性感承诺对自己说，“当事情达到那个点时，我会消灭她。”当他在最暴力的接触中颤抖时，他期待着，每一个四肢都在微妙地颤抖。热情地接近她，因太多的欲望而颤抖。

She had a curious sort of allegiance with Loerke, all the while, now, something insidious and traitorous. Gerald knew of it. But in the unnatural state of patience, and the unwillingness to harden himself against her, in which he found himself, he took no notice, although her soft kindliness to the other man, whom he hated as a noxious insect, made him shiver again with an access of the strange shuddering that came over him repeatedly.
她对洛克抱有一种奇怪的忠诚，但现在却变得阴险而叛逆。杰拉德知道这一点。但在他发现自己处于一种不自然的耐心状态中，并且不愿意对她冷酷无情时，他没有注意到，尽管她对另一个男人的温柔善意让他再次颤抖，他讨厌这个男人，他像一只有毒的昆虫一样。他反复感到奇怪的颤抖。

He left her alone only when he went skiing, a sport he loved, and which she did not practise. The he seemed to sweep out of life, to be a projectile into the beyond. And often, when he went away, she talked to the little German sculptor. They had an invariable topic, in their art.
他只在去滑雪时才离开她，滑雪是他喜爱的运动，但她不参加这项运动。他似乎被扫出了生活，成为一个射向彼岸的射弹。当他离开时，她常常和这位德国小雕塑家交谈。他们的艺术中有一个不变的主题。

They were almost of the same ideas. He hated Mestrovic, was not satisfied with the Futurists, he liked the West African wooden figures, the Aztec art, Mexican and Central American. He saw the grotesque, and a curious sort of mechanical motion intoxicated him, a confusion in nature. They had a curious game with each other, Gudrun and Loerke, of infinite suggestivity, strange and leering, as if they had some esoteric understanding of life, that they alone were initiated into the fearful central secrets, that the world dared not know. Their whole correspondence was in a strange, barely comprehensible suggestivity, they kindled themselves at the subtle lust of the Egyptians or the Mexicans. The whole game was one of subtle inter-suggestivity, and they wanted to keep it on the plane of suggestion. From their verbal and physical nuances they got the highest satisfaction in the nerves, from a queer interchange of half-suggested ideas, looks, expressions and gestures, which were quite intolerable, though incomprehensible, to Gerald. He had no terms in which to think of their commerce, his terms were much too gross.
他们的想法几乎相同。他讨厌梅斯特罗维奇，对未来主义者不满意，他喜欢西非的木制人物、阿兹特克艺术、墨西哥和中美洲。他看到了这怪诞的景象，一种奇怪的机械运动让他陶醉，一种大自然的混乱。古德伦和洛克，他们彼此之间进行着一场好奇的游戏，充满了无限的暗示，奇怪而斜视，仿佛他们对生活有某种深奥的理解，只有他们才开始了解世界不敢知道的可怕的核心秘密。他们的整个通信充满了一种奇怪的、难以理解的暗示，他们被埃及人或墨西哥人的微妙欲望点燃了。整个游戏是一种微妙的相互暗示，他们希望将其保持在暗示的层面上。从他们言语和身体上的细微差别，从半暗示的想法、表情、表情和手势的奇怪交流中，他们得到了最高的神经满足，这对杰拉尔德来说是相当难以忍受的，尽管难以理解。他没有任何条件来考虑他们的贸易，他的条件太粗暴了。

The suggestion of primitive art was their refuge, and the inner mysteries of sensation their object of worship. Art and Life were to them the Reality and the Unreality.
原始艺术的暗示是他们的避难所，感觉的内在奥秘是他们崇拜的对象。艺术和生活对他们来说就是现实和非现实。

‘Of course,’ said Gudrun, ‘life doesn’t REALLY matter—it is one’s art which is central. What one does in one’s life has PEU DE RAPPORT, it doesn’t signify much.’
“当然，”古德伦说，“生活并不重要——重要的是一个人的艺术。”一个人一生中所做的事情有 PEU DE RAPPORT，这并没有多大意义。

‘Yes, that is so, exactly,’ replied the sculptor. ‘What one does in one’s art, that is the breath of one’s being. What one does in one’s life, that is a bagatelle for the outsiders to fuss about.’
“是的，确实如此，”雕塑家回答道。 “一个人在艺术中所做的事情，就是一个人存在的气息。一生所做的事，是外人可以大惊小怪的小事。

It was curious what a sense of elation and freedom Gudrun found in this communication. She felt established for ever. Of course Gerald was BAGATELLE. Love was one of the temporal things in her life, except in so far as she was an artist. She thought of Cleopatra—Cleopatra must have been an artist; she reaped the essential from a man, she harvested the ultimate sensation, and threw away the husk; and Mary Stuart, and the great Rachel, panting with her lovers after the theatre, these were the exoteric exponents of love. After all, what was the lover but fuel for the transport of this subtle knowledge, for a female art, the art of pure, perfect knowledge in sensuous understanding.
令人好奇的是，古德伦在这次交流中发现了一种什么样的兴高采烈和自由感。她感觉自己永远稳固了。当然，杰拉德是个小事。爱情是她生命中短暂的事物之一，除非她是一名艺术家。她想到了克利奥帕特拉——克利奥帕特拉一定是一位艺术家；她从男人身上收获了精华，收获了极致的感觉，却丢掉了外壳；玛丽·斯图亚特和伟大的雷切尔在戏剧结束后与她的情人气喘吁吁，这些都是爱情的通俗诠释者。毕竟，对于女性艺术，对于感性理解中纯粹、完美知识的艺术来说，情人不过是传递这种微妙知识的燃料。

One evening Gerald was arguing with Loerke about Italy and Tripoli. The Englishman was in a strange, inflammable state, the German was excited. It was a contest of words, but it meant a conflict of spirit between the two men. And all the while Gudrun could see in Gerald an arrogant English contempt for a foreigner. Although Gerald was quivering, his eyes flashing, his face flushed, in his argument there was a brusqueness, a savage contempt in his manner, that made Gudrun’s blood flare up, and made Loerke keen and mortified. For Gerald came down like a sledge-hammer with his assertions, anything the little German said was merely contemptible rubbish.
一天晚上，杰拉尔德正在与洛克争论意大利和的黎波里的问题。英国人处于一种奇怪的、易怒的状态，而德国人则很兴奋。这是一场言语的较量，但却意味着两个人之间的精神冲突。古德伦一直在杰拉尔德身上看到了对外国人的傲慢的英国人蔑视。尽管杰拉尔德浑身发抖，眼睛闪闪发亮，脸色通红，但他的争辩中却充满了粗鲁和野蛮的轻蔑，这让古德伦的血液沸腾起来，让洛尔克感到敏锐和羞愧。对于杰拉德来说，他的断言就像大锤一样，这个小德国人所说的任何话都只是可鄙的垃圾。

At last Loerke turned to Gudrun, raising his hands in helpless irony, a shrug of ironical dismissal, something appealing and child-like.
最后，洛克转向古德伦，举起双手，做出无助的讽刺，耸耸肩，讽刺地表示不予理睬，这是一种吸引人的、孩子般的感觉。

‘Sehen sie, gnadige Frau-’ he began.
“Sehen sie，gnadige Frau——”他开始说道。

‘Bitte sagen Sie nicht immer, gnadige Frau,’ cried Gudrun, her eyes flashing, her cheeks burning. She looked like a vivid Medusa. Her voice was loud and clamorous, the other people in the room were startled.
“Bitte sagen Sie nicht immer，gnadige Frau，”古德伦喊道，她的眼睛闪闪发亮，脸颊在燃烧。她看起来就像一个生动的美杜莎。她的声音很大，吵闹，房间里的其他人都吓了一跳。

‘Please don’t call me Mrs Crich,’ she cried aloud.
“请不要叫我克里奇夫人，”她大声喊道。

The name, in Loerke’s mouth particularly, had been an intolerable humiliation and constraint upon her, these many days.
这些天来，这个名字，尤其是在洛克的嘴里，对她来说是一种难以忍受的羞辱和束缚。

The two men looked at her in amazement. Gerald went white at the cheek-bones.
两个男人惊讶地看着她。杰拉尔德的颧骨变白了。

‘What shall I say, then?’ asked Loerke, with soft, mocking insinuation.
“那我该怎么说呢？”洛克问道，声音里带着轻柔的、嘲讽的意味。

‘Sagen Sie nur nicht das,’ she muttered, her cheeks flushed crimson. ‘Not that, at least.’
“Sagen Sie nur nicht das，”她低声说道，脸颊涨得通红。 “至少不是这样。”

She saw, by the dawning look on Loerke’s face, that he had understood. She was NOT Mrs Crich! So-o-, that explained a great deal.
从洛克脸上焕然一新的表情，她看出他已经明白了。她不是克里奇夫人！所以-o-，这解释了很多。

‘Soll ich Fraulein sagen?’ he asked, malevolently.
“那么，这位女士是不是？”他恶毒地问道。

‘I am not married,’ she said, with some hauteur.
“我还没结婚，”她傲慢地说。

Her heart was fluttering now, beating like a bewildered bird. She knew she had dealt a cruel wound, and she could not bear it.
她的心现在扑通扑通地跳动，像一只迷惑的小鸟一样跳动。她知道自己受到了残酷的伤害，她无法承受。

Gerald sat erect, perfectly still, his face pale and calm, like the face of a statue. He was unaware of her, or of Loerke or anybody. He sat perfectly still, in an unalterable calm. Loerke, meanwhile, was crouching and glancing up from under his ducked head.
杰拉德笔直地坐着，一动不动，脸色苍白而平静，就像一尊雕像的脸。他不知道她，也不知道洛尔克，也不知道任何人。他一动不动地坐着，保持着不可改变的平静。与此同时，洛克蹲下身子，低下头往上看。

Gudrun was tortured for something to say, to relieve the suspense. She twisted her face in a smile, and glanced knowingly, almost sneering, at Gerald.
古德伦被折磨得有话要说，以缓解悬念。她微笑着扭过脸，有意地、近乎冷笑地看了杰拉尔德一眼。

‘Truth is best,’ she said to him, with a grimace.
“真相是最好的，”她做了个鬼脸对他说。

But now again she was under his domination; now, because she had dealt him this blow; because she had destroyed him, and she did not know how he had taken it. She watched him. He was interesting to her. She had lost her interest in Loerke.
但现在她又处于他的统治之下；现在，因为她给了他这样的打击；因为她毁了他，而她不知道他是如何接受的。她看着他。他对她来说很有趣。她对洛克失去了兴趣。

Gerald rose at length, and went over in a leisurely still movement, to the Professor. The two began a conversation on Goethe.
杰拉德终于站了起来，以一种悠闲而平静的动作走向教授。两人开始谈论歌德。

She was rather piqued by the simplicity of Gerald’s demeanour this evening. He did not seem angry or disgusted, only he looked curiously innocent and pure, really beautiful. Sometimes it came upon him, this look of clear distance, and it always fascinated her.
杰拉德今晚的简单举止让她相当恼火。他看上去没有生气，也没有厌恶，只是看上去出奇的天真纯洁，真的很漂亮。有时他会看到这种清晰的距离感，这总是让她着迷。

She waited, troubled, throughout the evening. She thought he would avoid her, or give some sign. But he spoke to her simply and unemotionally, as he would to anyone else in the room. A certain peace, an abstraction possessed his soul.
她焦急地等待了整个晚上。她以为他会避开她，或者做出某种迹象。但他对她说话简单、不带感情，就像他对房间里的其他人一样。某种平静、一种抽象占据了他的灵魂。

She went to his room, hotly, violently in love with him. He was so beautiful and inaccessible. He kissed her, he was a lover to her. And she had extreme pleasure of him. But he did not come to, he remained remote and candid, unconscious. She wanted to speak to him. But this innocent, beautiful state of unconsciousness that had come upon him prevented her. She felt tormented and dark.
她走进他的房间，热烈地、猛烈地爱着他。他是那么美丽，又那么难以接近。他吻了她，他是她的情人。她对他感到非常高兴。但他并没有醒过来，他仍然保持着疏远和坦诚，没有意识。她想和他说话。但降临在他身上的这种天真的、美丽的无意识状态却阻止了她。她感到痛苦和黑暗。

In the morning, however, he looked at her with a little aversion, some horror and some hatred darkening into his eyes. She withdrew on to her old ground. But still he would not gather himself together, against her.
然而早上，他看着她的眼神里带着一丝厌恶，一丝惊恐，一丝仇恨。她退回到原来的地盘。但他仍然不肯聚集起来反对她。

Loerke was waiting for her now. The little artist, isolated in his own complete envelope, felt that here at last was a woman from whom he could get something. He was uneasy all the while, waiting to talk with her, subtly contriving to be near her. Her presence filled him with keenness and excitement, he gravitated cunningly towards her, as if she had some unseen force of attraction.
洛克现在正在等她。这位小艺术家，孤立在自己完整的信封里，觉得终于有一个女人可以从他身上得到一些东西了。他一直很不安，等着和她说话，巧妙地靠近她。她的存在让他充满了敏锐和兴奋，他狡猾地被她吸引，仿佛她有某种看不见的吸引力。

He was not in the least doubtful of himself, as regards Gerald. Gerald was one of the outsiders. Loerke only hated him for being rich and proud and of fine appearance. All these things, however, riches, pride of social standing, handsome physique, were externals. When it came to the relation with a woman such as Gudrun, he, Loerke, had an approach and a power that Gerald never dreamed of.
对于杰拉德，他对自己没有丝毫怀疑。杰拉德是局外人之一。洛尔克只恨他富有、骄傲、外表俊美。然而，所有这些东西，财富、社会地位的骄傲、英俊的体格，都是外在的。当涉及到与古德伦这样的女人的关系时，他，洛克，拥有杰拉德从未梦想过的方法和力量。

How should Gerald hope to satisfy a woman of Gudrun’s calibre? Did he think that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him? Loerke knew a secret beyond these things. The greatest power is the one that is subtle and adjusts itself, not one which blindly attacks. And he, Loerke, had understanding where Gerald was a calf. He, Loerke, could penetrate into depths far out of Gerald’s knowledge. Gerald was left behind like a postulant in the ante-room of this temple of mysteries, this woman. But he Loerke, could he not penetrate into the inner darkness, find the spirit of the woman in its inner recess, and wrestle with it there, the central serpent that is coiled at the core of life.
杰拉德该如何满足古德伦这样有才干的女人呢？他认为骄傲、强大的意志或体力会对他有帮助吗？除了这些之外，洛克还知道一个秘密。最伟大的力量是微妙的、自我调整的力量，而不是盲目攻击的力量。而他，洛克，知道杰拉尔德在哪里是一头小牛。他，洛克，能够深入到杰拉德知识之外的深处。杰拉德就像一个后殿的人一样被留在了这座神秘殿堂的前厅里，这个女人。但他洛克，难道他不能穿透内心的黑暗，在其内心的深处找到女人的精神，并在那里与它搏斗，那条盘绕在生命核心的中央蛇。

What was it, after all, that a woman wanted? Was it mere social effect, fulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of mankind? Was it even a union in love and goodness? Did she want ‘goodness’? Who but a fool would accept this of Gudrun? This was but the street view of her wants. Cross the threshold, and you found her completely, completely cynical about the social world and its advantages. Once inside the house of her soul and there was a pungent atmosphere of corrosion, an inflamed darkness of sensation, and a vivid, subtle, critical consciousness, that saw the world distorted, horrific.
女人到底想要什么？这仅仅是社会效果、在社会世界、在人类社会中实现野心吗？甚至是爱与善的结合吗？她想要‘善良’吗？除了傻瓜之外谁会接受古德伦的这一点呢？这只是她想要的街景。跨过门槛，你会发现她对社交世界及其优势完全愤世嫉俗。一旦进入她灵魂的殿堂，就会有一种刺鼻的腐蚀气氛，一种燃烧的黑暗感觉，以及一种生动、微妙、批判的意识，她看到了世界扭曲的、可怕的。

What then, what next? Was it sheer blind force of passion that would satisfy her now? Not this, but the subtle thrills of extreme sensation in reduction. It was an unbroken will reacting against her unbroken will in a myriad subtle thrills of reduction, the last subtle activities of analysis and breaking down, carried out in the darkness of her, whilst the outside form, the individual, was utterly unchanged, even sentimental in its poses.
那么，接下来呢？难道现在纯粹是盲目的激情就能满足她吗？不是这个，而是极度感觉减少时的微妙兴奋。这是一种完整的意志，在无数微妙的还原刺激中，对她完整的意志作出反应，最后的分析和分解的微妙活动，在她的黑暗中进行，而外在形式，个人，却完全没有改变，甚至是感性的。在它的姿势。

But between two particular people, any two people on earth, the range of pure sensational experience is limited. The climax of sensual reaction, once reached in any direction, is reached finally, there is no going on. There is only repetition possible, or the going apart of the two protagonists, or the subjugating of the one will to the other, or death.
但在两个特定的人之间，地球上的任何两个人之间，纯粹的感官体验的范围是有限的。感官反应的高潮，无论向哪个方向，一旦达到，就最终达到了，没有任何进展。唯一可能的就是重复，或者两个主角的分离，或者一个意志屈服于另一个，或者死亡。

Gerald had penetrated all the outer places of Gudrun’s soul. He was to her the most crucial instance of the existing world, the NE PLUS ULTRA of the world of man as it existed for her. In him she knew the world, and had done with it. Knowing him finally she was the Alexander seeking new worlds. But there WERE no new worlds, there were no more MEN, there were only creatures, little, ultimate CREATURES like Loerke. The world was finished now, for her. There was only the inner, individual darkness, sensation within the ego, the obscene religious mystery of ultimate reduction, the mystic frictional activities of diabolic reducing down, disintegrating the vital organic body of life.
杰拉尔德已经穿透了古德伦灵魂的所有外部区域。对她来说，他是现存世界最重要的实例，是对她来说存在的人类世界的NE PLUS ULTRA。在他的身上，她了解了这个世界，并且已经摆脱了这个世界。最终认识了他，她就是寻找新世界的亚历山大。但没有新的世界，不再有人类，只有生物，像洛克这样的小终极生物。对她来说，世界已经完蛋了。只有内在的、个人的黑暗、自我内部的感觉、终极还原的淫秽宗教神秘、恶魔还原的神秘摩擦活动、瓦解生命的重要有机体。

All this Gudrun knew in her subconsciousness, not in her mind. She knew her next step-she knew what she should move on to, when she left Gerald. She was afraid of Gerald, that he might kill her. But she did not intend to be killed. A fine thread still united her to him. It should not be HER death which broke it. She had further to go, a further, slow exquisite experience to reap, unthinkable subtleties of sensation to know, before she was finished.
这一切古德伦都在她的潜意识里知道，而不是在她的头脑里。当她离开杰拉德时，她知道自己的下一步是什么——她知道自己应该走向何方。她害怕杰拉尔德，害怕他会杀了她。但她并不想被杀。一根细线仍然把她和他联系在一起。不应该是她的死打破了它。在她完成之前，她还有更远的路要走，更远的、缓慢的精致体验要收获，要了解难以想象的微妙感觉。

Of the last series of subtleties, Gerald was not capable. He could not touch the quick of her. But where his ruder blows could not penetrate, the fine, insinuating blade of Loerke’s insect-like comprehension could. At least, it was time for her now to pass over to the other, the creature, the final craftsman. She knew that Loerke, in his innermost soul, was detached from everything, for him there was neither heaven nor earth nor hell. He admitted no allegiance, he gave no adherence anywhere. He was single and, by abstraction from the rest, absolute in himself.
对于最后一系列的微妙之处，杰拉尔德没有能力。他无法触碰她的快处。但他粗鲁的打击无法穿透的地方，洛克昆虫般理解力的精细、含沙射影的刀片却可以穿透。至少，她现在是时候把权力交给另一个人了，这个生物，最后的工匠。她知道，洛克在他的灵魂深处，是超脱一切的，对他来说，既没有天堂，也没有人间，也没有地狱。他不承认效忠，也不在任何地方表示服从。他是单身，并且与其他人不同，他是绝对的。

Whereas in Gerald’s soul there still lingered some attachment to the rest, to the whole. And this was his limitation. He was limited, BORNE, subject to his necessity, in the last issue, for goodness, for righteousness, for oneness with the ultimate purpose. That the ultimate purpose might be the perfect and subtle experience of the process of death, the will being kept unimpaired, that was not allowed in him. And this was his limitation.
而在杰拉尔德的灵魂中，仍然残留着对其他事物、对整体的依恋。而这就是他的局限性。在最后一期中，他是有限的，天生的，受制于他的需要，为了善良，为了正义，为了与最终目的的合一。最终的目的可能是对死亡过程的完美而微妙的体验，保持意志不受损害，这是他所不允许的。而这就是他的局限性。

There was a hovering triumph in Loerke, since Gudrun had denied her marriage with Gerald. The artist seemed to hover like a creature on the wing, waiting to settle. He did not approach Gudrun violently, he was never ill-timed. But carried on by a sure instinct in the complete darkness of his soul, he corresponded mystically with her, imperceptibly, but palpably.
自从古德伦否认她与杰拉尔德的婚姻以来，洛尔克有一种悬而未决的胜利。这位艺术家似乎像一只翅膀上的生物一样盘旋，等待安定下来。他并没有暴力地接近古德伦，他从来都不是不合时宜的。但在他灵魂的完全黑暗中，他凭着一种确定的本能，与她神秘地通信，难以察觉，但却明显。

For two days, he talked to her, continued the discussions of art, of life, in which they both found such pleasure. They praised the by-gone things, they took a sentimental, childish delight in the achieved perfections of the past. Particularly they liked the late eighteenth century, the period of Goethe and of Shelley, and Mozart.
一连两天，他和她聊天，继续讨论艺术、生活，他们都感到很高兴。他们赞扬过去的事物，他们对过去所取得的完美感到感伤的、孩子气的喜悦。他们特别喜欢十八世纪末、歌德、雪莱和莫扎特的时代。

They played with the past, and with the great figures of the past, a sort of little game of chess, or marionettes, all to please themselves. They had all the great men for their marionettes, and they two were the God of the show, working it all. As for the future, that they never mentioned except one laughed out some mocking dream of the destruction of the world by a ridiculous catastrophe of man’s invention: a man invented such a perfect explosive that it blew the earth in two, and the two halves set off in different directions through space, to the dismay of the inhabitants: or else the people of the world divided into two halves, and each half decided IT was perfect and right, the other half was wrong and must be destroyed; so another end of the world. Or else, Loerke’s dream of fear, the world went cold, and snow fell everywhere, and only white creatures, polar-bears, white foxes, and men like awful white snow-birds, persisted in ice cruelty.
他们玩弄过去，玩弄过去的伟人，就像下国际象棋或牵线木偶一样，一切都是为了取悦自己。他们拥有所有伟大的人物作为他们的木偶，他们两个是表演之神，完成了这一切。至于未来，他们从来没有提到过，除了一个人嘲笑人类发明的一场可笑的灾难毁灭世界的嘲笑梦想：一个人发明了一种如此完美的炸药，它把地球炸成了两半，两半都固定了。穿过太空向不同的方向飞去，这让居民们感到沮丧：否则世界上的人们就会分成两半，每一半都认为它是完美和正确的，另一半是错误的，必须被摧毁；所以世界的另一个尽头。否则，在洛克的恐惧之梦中，世界变冷了，到处都是雪花，只有白色的生物，北极熊，白狐，以及像可怕的白色雪鸟一样的人类，坚持着冰冷的残酷。

Apart from these stories, they never talked of the future. They delighted most either in mocking imaginations of destruction, or in sentimental, fine marionette-shows of the past. It was a sentimental delight to reconstruct the world of Goethe at Weimar, or of Schiller and poverty and faithful love, or to see again Jean Jacques in his quakings, or Voltaire at Ferney, or Frederick the Great reading his own poetry.
除了这些故事，他们从未谈论过未来。他们最喜欢的要么是嘲笑毁灭的想象，要么是过去感伤的、精美的木偶表演。在魏玛重建歌德的世界，或者席勒的贫穷和忠诚的爱情，或者再次看到让·雅克的颤抖，或者伏尔泰在费内，或者腓特烈大帝阅读他自己的诗歌，都是一种感伤的快乐。

They talked together for hours, of literature and sculpture and painting, amusing themselves with Flaxman and Blake and Fuseli, with tenderness, and with Feuerbach and Bocklin. It would take them a life-time, they felt to live again, IN PETTO, the lives of the great artists. But they preferred to stay in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.
他们在一起聊了几个小时，谈论文学、雕塑和绘画，以弗拉克斯曼、布莱克和富塞利为乐，充满温柔，也以费尔巴哈和博克林为乐。这将花费他们一生的时间，他们感觉再次生活在佩托，伟大艺术家的生活。但他们更愿意停留在十八、十九世纪。

They talked in a mixture of languages. The ground-work was French, in either case. But he ended most of his sentences in a stumble of English and a conclusion of German, she skilfully wove herself to her end in whatever phrase came to her. She took a peculiar delight in this conversation. It was full of odd, fantastic expression, of double meanings, of evasions, of suggestive vagueness. It was a real physical pleasure to her to make this thread of conversation out of the different-coloured stands of three languages.
他们用多种语言交谈。不管怎样，基础工作都是法语。但他的大部分句子都以结结巴巴的英语和德语作为结尾，而她巧妙地用任何想到的短语来结束自己的句子。她对这次谈话感到特别高兴。它充满了奇怪、荒诞的表达方式、双重含义、回避、暗示性的模糊。用三种语言的不同颜色的立场来构建这条对话线索对她来说是一种真正的身体上的乐趣。

And all the while they two were hovering, hesitating round the flame of some invisible declaration. He wanted it, but was held back by some inevitable reluctance. She wanted it also, but she wanted to put it off, to put it off indefinitely, she still had some pity for Gerald, some connection with him. And the most fatal of all, she had the reminiscent sentimental compassion for herself in connection with him. Because of what HAD been, she felt herself held to him by immortal, invisible threads-because of what HAD been, because of his coming to her that first night, into her own house, in his extremity, because—
自始至终，他们两个都在某个无形宣言的火焰周围徘徊、犹豫。他想要它，但由于不可避免的不情愿而被阻止。她也想要，但她想推迟，无限期地推迟，她对杰拉德仍然有一些怜悯，与他有一些联系。最致命的是，她对自己对他怀有一种令人怀念的同情心。因为曾经发生过的事情，她觉得自己被不朽的、无形的丝线紧紧地拴在他身上——因为曾经发生过的事情，因为他第一个晚上来到她身边，进入她自己的房子，在他的绝境中，因为——

Gerald was gradually overcome with a revulsion of loathing for Loerke. He did not take the man seriously, he despised him merely, except as he felt in Gudrun’s veins the influence of the little creature. It was this that drove Gerald wild, the feeling in Gudrun’s veins of Loerke’s presence, Loerke’s being, flowing dominant through her.
杰拉德逐渐对洛克产生了厌恶的情绪。他并没有认真对待这个人，他只是鄙视他，除非他在古德伦的血管中感受到了这个小生物的影响。正是这一点让杰拉德变得疯狂，古德伦的血管里感觉到洛尔克的存在，洛尔克的存在，在她体内流动着。

‘What makes you so smitten with that little vermin?’ he asked, really puzzled. For he, man-like, could not see anything attractive or important AT ALL in Loerke. Gerald expected to find some handsomeness or nobleness, to account for a woman’s subjection. But he saw none here, only an insect-like repulsiveness.
“是什么让你对那个小害虫如此着迷？”他非常困惑地问道。因为他作为一个男人，在洛克身上根本看不到任何有吸引力或重要的东西。杰拉尔德期望找到一些英俊或高贵的东西，以解释女人的服从。但他在这里什么也没看到，只有一种昆虫般的令人厌恶的感觉。

Gudrun flushed deeply. It was these attacks she would never forgive.
古德伦的脸涨得通红。她永远不会原谅这些攻击。

‘What do you mean?’ she replied. ‘My God, what a mercy I am NOT married to you!’
“你什么意思？”她回答道。 “天哪，真是怜悯我没有嫁给你！”

Her voice of flouting and contempt scotched him. He was brought up short. But he recovered himself.
她的声音充满了蔑视和蔑视，让他心烦意乱。他从小就很矮小。但他恢复了自我。

‘Tell me, only tell me,’ he reiterated in a dangerous narrowed voice—‘tell me what it is that fascinates you in him.’
“告诉我，只告诉我，”他用危险的、狭窄的声音重复道——“告诉我他身上什么让你着迷。”

‘I am not fascinated,’ she said, with cold repelling innocence.
“我并不着迷，”她说道，语气冰冷，令人厌恶。

‘Yes, you are. You are fascinated by that little dry snake, like a bird gaping ready to fall down its throat.’
'是的，你是。你被那条干枯的小蛇迷住了，就像一只张开嘴准备掉进喉咙的鸟一样。

She looked at him with black fury.
她用黑色的愤怒看着他。

‘I don’t choose to be discussed by you,’ she said.
“我不选择被你讨论，”她说。

‘It doesn’t matter whether you choose or not,’ he replied, ‘that doesn’t alter the fact that you are ready to fall down and kiss the feet of that little insect. And I don’t want to prevent you—do it, fall down and kiss his feet. But I want to know, what it is that fascinates you—what is it?’
“无论你选择与否，”他回答道，“这都不会改变你已经准备好倒下并亲吻那只小昆虫的脚的事实。”我不想阻止你——去做吧，摔倒并亲吻他的脚。但我想知道，是什么让你着迷——是什么？

She was silent, suffused with black rage.
她沉默不语，浑身充满黑色的愤怒。

‘How DARE you come brow-beating me,’ she cried, ‘how dare you, you little squire, you bully. What right have you over me, do you think?’
“你怎么敢来威吓我，”她喊道，“你怎么敢，你这个小乡绅，你这个恶霸。”你认为你有什么权利凌驾于我之上？

His face was white and gleaming, she knew by the light in his eyes that she was in his power—the wolf. And because she was in his power, she hated him with a power that she wondered did not kill him. In her will she killed him as he stood, effaced him.
他的脸色苍白，闪闪发光，她从他眼中的光芒知道，她已经在他的权力之下了——狼。而且因为她在他的权力之下，她对他的仇恨之大，她想知道这种力量不会杀死他。在她的遗嘱中，她在他站着的时候杀死了他，把他抹去了。

‘It is not a question of right,’ said Gerald, sitting down on a chair. She watched the change in his body. She saw his clenched, mechanical body moving there like an obsession. Her hatred of him was tinged with fatal contempt.
“这不是权利问题，”杰拉尔德坐在椅子上说道。她看着他身体的变化。她看到他紧握的机械身体像痴迷一样在那里移动。她对他的仇恨中夹杂着致命的蔑视。

‘It’s not a question of my right over you—though I HAVE some right, remember. I want to know, I only want to know what it is that subjugates you to that little scum of a sculptor downstairs, what it is that brings you down like a humble maggot, in worship of him. I want to know what you creep after.’
“这不是我对你的权利问题——尽管我有一些权利，记住。我想知道，我只想知道是什么让你屈服于楼下那个雕塑家的小渣子，是什么让你像一条卑微的蛆虫一样崇拜他。我想知道你在追寻什么。

She stood over against the window, listening. Then she turned round.
她站在窗边，侧耳倾听。然后她转过身来。

‘Do you?’ she said, in her most easy, most cutting voice. ‘Do you want to know what it is in him? It’s because he has some understanding of a woman, because he is not stupid. That’s why it is.’
“你愿意吗？”她用她最轻松、最尖锐的声音说道。 ‘你想知道他身上有什么吗？因为他对女人有一些了解，因为他不傻。这就是原因。

A queer, sinister, animal-like smile came over Gerald’s face.
杰拉尔德的脸上浮现出一丝古怪、险恶、动物般的微笑。

‘But what understanding is it?’ he said. ‘The understanding of a flea, a hopping flea with a proboscis. Why should you crawl abject before the understanding of a flea?’
“但是这是什么理解呢？”他说。 ‘对跳蚤的理解，一只长着长鼻的跳跃跳蚤。为什么你要在了解跳蚤之前卑微地爬行呢？

There passed through Gudrun’s mind Blake’s representation of the soul of a flea. She wanted to fit it to Loerke. Blake was a clown too. But it was necessary to answer Gerald.
布莱克对跳蚤灵魂的描绘在古德伦的脑海中闪过。她想把它适合洛克。布莱克也是一个小丑。但有必要回答杰拉德。

‘Don’t you think the understanding of a flea is more interesting than the understanding of a fool?’ she asked.
“你不觉得了解跳蚤比了解傻瓜更有趣吗？”她问道。

‘A fool!’ he repeated.
“一个傻瓜！”他重复道。

‘A fool, a conceited fool—a Dummkopf,’ she replied, adding the German word.
“一个傻瓜，一个自负的傻瓜——一个笨蛋，”她回答道，并加上了德语单词。

‘Do you call me a fool?’ he replied. ‘Well, wouldn’t I rather be the fool I am, than that flea downstairs?’
“你称我为傻瓜吗？”他回答道。 “好吧，我不是宁愿做个傻瓜，也不愿做楼下的那只跳蚤吗？”

She looked at him. A certain blunt, blind stupidity in him palled on her soul, limiting her.
她看着他。他身上的某种直率、盲目的愚蠢使她的灵魂黯然失色，限制了她。

‘You give yourself away by that last,’ she said.
“最后你就暴露了自己，”她说。

He sat and wondered.
他坐下来思考。

‘I shall go away soon,’ he said.
“我很快就会离开，”他说。

She turned on him.
她转向他。

‘Remember,’ she said, ‘I am completely independent of you—completely. You make your arrangements, I make mine.’
“记住，”她说，“我完全独立于你——完全独立。”你做你的安排，我做我的。

He pondered this.
他思考着这一点。

‘You mean we are strangers from this minute?’ he asked.
“你的意思是从这一刻起我们就成了陌生人了？”他问道。

She halted and flushed. He was putting her in a trap, forcing her hand. She turned round on him.
她停了下来，脸红了。他设下圈套，逼迫她出手。她转过身来看着他。

‘Strangers,’ she said, ‘we can never be. But if you WANT to make any movement apart from me, then I wish you to know you are perfectly free to do so. Do not consider me in the slightest.’
“陌生人，”她说，“我们永远不可能成为陌生人。”但如果你想在我之外采取任何行动，那么我希望你知道你完全可以自由地这样做。丝毫不要考虑我。

Even so slight an implication that she needed him and was depending on him still was sufficient to rouse his passion. As he sat a change came over his body, the hot, molten stream mounted involuntarily through his veins. He groaned inwardly, under its bondage, but he loved it. He looked at her with clear eyes, waiting for her.
即使是那么轻微的暗示，她需要他，依赖他，也足以激起他的热情。当他坐着的时候，他的身体发生了变化，炽热的熔浆不由自主地在他的血管中上升。他在它的束缚下内心呻吟，但他喜欢它。他用清澈的目光看着她，等待着她。

She knew at once, and was shaken with cold revulsion. HOW could he look at her with those clear, warm, waiting eyes, waiting for her, even now? What had been said between them, was it not enough to put them worlds asunder, to freeze them forever apart! And yet he was all transfused and roused, waiting for her.
她立刻就明白了，并因冰冷的厌恶而浑身发抖。他怎么能用那双清澈、温暖、等待的眼睛看着她，甚至现在还在等待着她？他们之间所说的话，难道还不足以让他们天壤之别，让他们永远分开吗！然而他却精神焕发，精神抖擞，等待着她。

It confused her. Turning her head aside, she said:
这让她很困惑。她侧过头，说道：

‘I shall always TELL you, whenever I am going to make any change—‘
“每当我要做出任何改变时，我都会告诉你——”

And with this she moved out of the room.
说完，她就走出了房间。

He sat suspended in a fine recoil of disappointment, that seemed gradually to be destroying his understanding. But the unconscious state of patience persisted in him. He remained motionless, without thought or knowledge, for a long time. Then he rose, and went downstairs, to play at chess with one of the students. His face was open and clear, with a certain innocent LAISSER-ALLER that troubled Gudrun most, made her almost afraid of him, whilst she disliked him deeply for it.
他坐在那里，感到一阵失望，这似乎正在逐渐摧毁他的理解力。但无意识的耐心状态一直在他身上持续存在。他很长一段时间一动不动，没有思想，也没有知识。然后他站起来，下楼去和一名学生下棋。他的脸坦率而清晰，带着某种天真无邪的莱瑟·阿勒，这让古德伦最烦恼，让她几乎害怕他，同时她也因此深深地不喜欢他。

It was after this that Loerke, who had never yet spoken to her personally, began to ask her of her state.
此后，从未与她私下交谈过的洛尔克开始询问她的情况。

‘You are not married at all, are you?’ he asked.
“你根本就没有结婚，是吗？”他问道。

She looked full at him.
她全神贯注地看着他。

‘Not in the least,’ she replied, in her measured way. Loerke laughed, wrinkling up his face oddly. There was a thin wisp of his hair straying on his forehead, she noticed that his skin was of a clear brown colour, his hands, his wrists. And his hands seemed closely prehensile. He seemed like topaz, so strangely brownish and pellucid.
“一点也不，”她谨慎地回答道。洛克笑了，脸上奇怪地皱起皱纹。他的额头上散落着一缕细发，她注意到他的皮肤是清澈的棕色，他的手，他的手腕。他的双手似乎紧紧握住。他看起来像黄玉，呈奇怪的棕色，而且透明。

‘Good,’ he said.
“很好，”他说。

Still it needed some courage for him to go on.
但他仍然需要一些勇气才能继续下去。

‘Was Mrs Birkin your sister?’ he asked.
“伯金夫人是你的妹妹吗？”他问道。

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

‘And was SHE married?’
“她结婚了吗？”

‘She was married.’
“她已经结婚了。”

‘Have you parents, then?’
“那你有父母吗？”

‘Yes,’ said Gudrun, ‘we have parents.’
“是的，”古德伦说，“我们有父母。”

And she told him, briefly, laconically, her position. He watched her closely, curiously all the while.
她简短地告诉了他她的立场。他一直好奇地密切注视着她。

‘So!’ he exclaimed, with some surprise. ‘And the Herr Crich, is he rich?’
“所以！”他有些惊讶地喊道。 “克里奇先生有钱吗？”

‘Yes, he is rich, a coal owner.’
“是的，他很有钱，是个煤老板。”

‘How long has your friendship with him lasted?’
“你和他的友谊持续了多久？”

‘Some months.’
“几个月了。”

There was a pause.
一阵停顿。

‘Yes, I am surprised,’ he said at length. ‘The English, I thought they were so—cold. And what do you think to do when you leave here?’
“是的，我很惊讶，”他最后说道。 “我觉得英国人太——冷酷了。”你离开这里后想做什么？

‘What do I think to do?’ she repeated.
“我想做什么？”她重复道。

‘Yes. You cannot go back to the teaching. No—‘ he shrugged his shoulders—‘that is impossible. Leave that to the CANAILLE who can do nothing else. You, for your part—you know, you are a remarkable woman, eine seltsame Frau. Why deny it—why make any question of it? You are an extraordinary woman, why should you follow the ordinary course, the ordinary life?’
'是的。你无法回到教法。不——”他耸耸肩——“那是不可能的。把这个留给那些无能为力的卡奈尔吧。就你而言——你知道，你是一位了不起的女人，eine seltsame Frau。为什么要否认它——为什么要质疑它？你是一个不平凡的女人，为什么要走平凡的道路、平凡的生活呢？

Gudrun sat looking at her hands, flushed. She was pleased that he said, so simply, that she was a remarkable woman. He would not say that to flatter her—he was far too self-opinionated and objective by nature. He said it as he would say a piece of sculpture was remarkable, because he knew it was so.
古珍坐在那儿看着自己的双手，脸红了。她很高兴他如此简单地说她是一位了不起的女人。他不会这么说来奉承她——他生性太自以为是、太客观了。他这样说就像他会说一件雕塑是非凡的，因为他知道事实就是如此。

And it gratified her to hear it from him. Other people had such a passion to make everything of one degree, of one pattern. In England it was chic to be perfectly ordinary. And it was a relief to her to be acknowledged extraordinary. Then she need not fret about the common standards.
听到他这么说，她很高兴。其他人则热衷于让一切都达到一种程度、一种模式。在英国，完全平凡就是时髦。被承认非凡对她来说是一种解脱。那么她就不必为共同标准而烦恼。

‘You see,’ she said, ‘I have no money whatsoever.’
“你看，”她说，“我根本就没有钱。”

‘Ach, money!’ he cried, lifting his shoulders. ‘When one is grown up, money is lying about at one’s service. It is only when one is young that it is rare. Take no thought for money—that always lies to hand.’
“啊，钱！”他抬起肩膀喊道。 “当一个人长大后，金钱就会为他服务。只有年轻的时候，才算是难得。不要考虑钱——钱总是触手可及的。

‘Does it?’ she said, laughing.
“是吗？”她笑着说。

‘Always. The Gerald will give you a sum, if you ask him for it—‘
'总是。杰拉尔德会给你一笔钱，如果你向他要的话——”

She flushed deeply.
她脸红得很厉害。

‘I will ask anybody else,’ she said, with some difficulty—‘but not him.’
“我会问其他人，”她有些困难地说，“但不会问他。”

Loerke looked closely at her.
洛克仔细地看着她。

‘Good,’ he said. ‘Then let it be somebody else. Only don’t go back to that England, that school. No, that is stupid.’
“很好，”他说。 ‘那就让别人来吧。只是不要回到那个英国，那个学校。不，那太愚蠢了。

Again there was a pause. He was afraid to ask her outright to go with him, he was not even quite sure he wanted her; and she was afraid to be asked. He begrudged his own isolation, was VERY chary of sharing his life, even for a day.
又是一阵停顿。他不敢直接要求她和他一起去，他甚至不确定自己是否想要她；她害怕被问到。他对自己的孤立感到不满，非常谨慎地分享自己的生活，即使是一天。

‘The only other place I know is Paris,’ she said, ‘and I can’t stand that.’
“我唯一知道的另一个地方是巴黎，”她说，“我无法忍受。”

She looked with her wide, steady eyes full at Loerke. He lowered his head and averted his face.
她用那双大而坚定的眼睛注视着洛克。他低下头，别开脸。

‘Paris, no!’ he said. ‘Between the RELIGION D’AMOUR, and the latest ‘ism, and the new turning to Jesus, one had better ride on a carrousel all day. But come to Dresden. I have a studio there—I can give you work,—oh, that would be easy enough. I haven’t seen any of your things, but I believe in you. Come to Dresden—that is a fine town to be in, and as good a life as you can expect of a town. You have everything there, without the foolishness of Paris or the beer of Munich.’
“巴黎，不！”他说。 “在爱情宗教和最新的‘主义’以及新的转向耶稣之间，人们最好整天骑在旋转木马上。”但来德累斯顿吧。我在那里有一个工作室——我可以给你工作——哦，那很容易。我没有见过你的任何东西，但我相信你。来德累斯顿吧——那是一座美好的小镇，也是您所能期待的美好生活。那里什么都有，没有巴黎的愚蠢，也没有慕尼黑的啤酒。”

He sat and looked at her, coldly. What she liked about him was that he spoke to her simple and flat, as to himself. He was a fellow craftsman, a fellow being to her, first.
他坐下来，冷冷地看着她。她喜欢他的一点是，他对她说话简单而平淡，就像对他自己一样。首先，他是一位工匠，对她来说是一个同胞。

‘No—Paris,’ he resumed, ‘it makes me sick. Pah—l’amour. I detest it. L’amour, l’amore, die Liebe—I detest it in every language. Women and love, there is no greater tedium,’ he cried.
“不——巴黎，”他继续说道，“这让我感到恶心。”呸——爱情。我讨厌它。 L'amour、l'amore、die Liebe——我讨厌所有语言中的这些词。女人和爱情，没有比这更乏味的了。”他喊道。

She was slightly offended. And yet, this was her own basic feeling. Men, and love—there was no greater tedium.
她有点生气。然而，这就是她自己的基本感觉。男人、爱情——再没有比这更单调乏味的了。

‘I think the same,’ she said.
“我也这么认为，”她说。

‘A bore,’ he repeated. ‘What does it matter whether I wear this hat or another. So love. I needn’t wear a hat at all, only for convenience. Neither need I love except for convenience. I tell you what, gnadige Frau—‘ and he leaned towards her—then he made a quick, odd gesture, as of striking something aside—‘gnadige Fraulein, never mind—I tell you what, I would give everything, everything, all your love, for a little companionship in intelligence—‘ his eyes flickered darkly, evilly at her. ‘You understand?’ he asked, with a faint smile. ‘It wouldn’t matter if she were a hundred years old, a thousand—it would be all the same to me, so that she can UNDERSTAND.’ He shut his eyes with a little snap.
“无聊，”他重复道。 “我戴这顶帽子还是另一顶帽子有什么关系呢？”所以爱。我根本不需要戴帽子，只是为了方便。除了方便之外，我也不需要喜欢。我告诉你什么，格纳迪格女士——”他向她倾身——然后他做了一个快速而奇怪的手势，就像把什么东西拨到一边——“格纳迪格女士，没关系——我告诉你什么，我愿意付出一切，一切，一切你的爱，为了一点智力上的陪伴——”他的眼睛阴暗地闪烁着，邪恶地看着她。 “你明白了吗？”他微笑着问道。 “她一百岁、一千岁都没关系——对我来说都一样，这样她就能理解。”他轻轻地闭上了眼睛。

Again Gudrun was rather offended. Did he not think her good looking, then? Suddenly she laughed.
古德伦再次感到相当生气。那他不觉得她好看吗？突然她笑了。

‘I shall have to wait about eighty years to suit you, at that!’ she said. ‘I am ugly enough, aren’t I?’
“我得等大约八十年才能适合你！”她说。 “我已经够丑了，不是吗？”

He looked at her with an artist’s sudden, critical, estimating eye.
他用艺术家突然的、挑剔的、估价的眼光看着她。

‘You are beautiful,’ he said, ‘and I am glad of it. But it isn’t that—it isn’t that,’ he cried, with emphasis that flattered her. ‘It is that you have a certain wit, it is the kind of understanding. For me, I am little, chetif, insignificant. Good! Do not ask me to be strong and handsome, then. But it is the ME—‘ he put his fingers to his mouth, oddly—‘it is the ME that is looking for a mistress, and my ME is waiting for the THEE of the mistress, for the match to my particular intelligence. You understand?’
“你很漂亮，”他说，“我很高兴。”但不是那样——不是那样，”他喊道，语气中强调的语气让她很受宠若惊。 ‘就是你有一定的智慧，就是那种悟性。对于我来说，我很小，很小，微不足道。好的！那就别要求我又强又帅了。但这是我——”他把手指放在嘴边，奇怪的是——“是我在寻找情妇，而我的我正在等待情妇的你，等待与我特殊的智力相匹配。你明白？'

‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I understand.’
“是的，”她说，“我明白。”

‘As for the other, this amour—‘ he made a gesture, dashing his hand aside, as if to dash away something troublesome—‘it is unimportant, unimportant. Does it matter, whether I drink white wine this evening, or whether I drink nothing? IT DOES NOT MATTER, it does not matter. So this love, this amour, this BAISER. Yes or no, soit ou soit pas, today, tomorrow, or never, it is all the same, it does not matter—no more than the white wine.’
“至于另一个，这段恋情——”他做了个手势，把手甩到一边，仿佛要赶走什么麻烦的东西——“不重要，不重要。”今晚我喝白葡萄酒还是不喝有什么关系吗？没关系，没关系。所以这爱，这恋情，这 BAISER。是或否，soit ou soit pas，今天，明天，或者永远，都是一样的，这并不重要——就像白葡萄酒一样。

He ended with an odd dropping of the head in a desperate negation. Gudrun watched him steadily. She had gone pale.
最后他奇怪地低下头，表示绝望的否定。古德伦目不转睛地看着他。她的脸色变得苍白。

Suddenly she stretched over and seized his hand in her own.
突然，她伸了个懒腰，抓住了他的手。

‘That is true,’ she said, in rather a high, vehement voice, ‘that is true for me too. It is the understanding that matters.’
“确实如此，”她用相当高亢、激烈的声音说道，“对我来说也是如此。”重要的是理解。

He looked up at her almost frightened, furtive. Then he nodded, a little sullenly. She let go his hand: he had made not the lightest response. And they sat in silence.
他抬头看着她，几乎是害怕的，鬼鬼祟祟的。然后他点了点头，表情有些阴沉。她松开了他的手：他没有做出任何轻微的反应。他们默默地坐着。

‘Do you know,’ he said, suddenly looking at her with dark, self-important, prophetic eyes, ‘your fate and mine, they will run together, till—‘ and he broke off in a little grimace.
“你知道吗，”他突然用黑色的、自以为是的、预言性的眼睛看着她，“你的命运和我的命运将一起运行，直到——”他做了个鬼脸，突然停了下来。

‘Till when?’ she asked, blanched, her lips going white. She was terribly susceptible to these evil prognostications, but he only shook his head.
“到什么时候？”她问道，脸色煞白，嘴唇发白。她非常容易受到这些邪恶的预言的影响，但他只是摇了摇头。

‘I don’t know,’ he said, ‘I don’t know.’
“我不知道，”他说，“我不知道。”

Gerald did not come in from his skiing until nightfall, he missed the coffee and cake that she took at four o’clock. The snow was in perfect condition, he had travelled a long way, by himself, among the snow ridges, on his skis, he had climbed high, so high that he could see over the top of the pass, five miles distant, could see the Marienhutte, the hostel on the crest of the pass, half buried in snow, and over into the deep valley beyond, to the dusk of the pine trees. One could go that way home; but he shuddered with nausea at the thought of home;—one could travel on skis down there, and come to the old imperial road, below the pass. But why come to any road? He revolted at the thought of finding himself in the world again. He must stay up there in the snow forever. He had been happy by himself, high up there alone, travelling swiftly on skis, taking far flights, and skimming past the dark rocks veined with brilliant snow.
杰拉德直到夜幕降临才从滑雪场回来，他想念她四点钟喝的咖啡和蛋糕。雪状况很好，他独自走了很长一段路，在雪脊之间，在他的滑雪板上，他爬得很高，高到他可以看到五英里外的山口顶部，可以看到Marienhutte，位于山口山顶的旅馆，半埋在雪中，一直延伸到远处的深谷，直到松树的黄昏。一个人可以走那条路回家；但一想到家，他就感到恶心，浑身发抖；——人们可以在那里滑雪，来到关口下方的古老皇家道路。但为什么要走任何一条路呢？他一想到自己再次来到这个世界就感到厌恶。他必须永远呆在雪地里。他一个人很开心，独自在高处，骑着滑雪板快速旅行，飞得很远，掠过布满灿烂雪花的黑色岩石。

But he felt something icy gathering at his heart. This strange mood of patience and innocence which had persisted in him for some days, was passing away, he would be left again a prey to the horrible passions and tortures.
但他却感觉心里有什么冰冷的东西在凝聚。这种奇怪的耐心和纯真情绪在他身上持续了几天，现在正在消失，他将再次成为可怕的激情和折磨的牺牲品。

So he came down reluctantly, snow-burned, snow-estranged, to the house in the hollow, between the knuckles of the mountain tops. He saw its lights shining yellow, and he held back, wishing he need not go in, to confront those people, to hear the turmoil of voices and to feel the confusion of other presences. He was isolated as if there were a vacuum round his heart, or a sheath of pure ice.
于是他不情愿地下来，浑身被雪烧焦，被雪疏远，来到山峰指缝之间的洼地里的房子里。他看到它的灯光闪烁着黄色，他退缩了，希望自己不需要进去，面对那些人，听到混乱的声音，感受到其他存在的混乱。他被孤立了，仿佛他的心周围是真空，或者是一层纯粹的冰层。

The moment he saw Gudrun something jolted in his soul. She was looking rather lofty and superb, smiling slowly and graciously to the Germans. A sudden desire leapt in his heart, to kill her. He thought, what a perfect voluptuous fulfilment it would be, to kill her. His mind was absent all the evening, estranged by the snow and his passion. But he kept the idea constant within him, what a perfect voluptuous consummation it would be to strangle her, to strangle every spark of life out of her, till she lay completely inert, soft, relaxed for ever, a soft heap lying dead between his hands, utterly dead. Then he would have had her finally and for ever; there would be such a perfect voluptuous finality.
当他看到古德伦的那一刻，他的灵魂里有什么东西震动了。她看上去颇为高高在上，对德国人缓缓而优雅地微笑。他的心里突然升起一股想要杀了她的念头。他想，如果杀了她，那将是多么完美的肉体满足啊。整个晚上他的思绪都在飘忽不定，被雪和他的激情所疏远。但他心中一直有这样的念头，如果能掐死她，掐死她身上的每一点生命的火花，那将是多么完美的肉欲的完美，直到她完全失去知觉，柔软，永远放松，像一团柔软的死尸躺在他的中间。双手，彻底死了。那么他就会最终并永远拥有她；会有如此完美的性感结局。

Gudrun was unaware of what he was feeling, he seemed so quiet and amiable, as usual. His amiability even made her feel brutal towards him.
古德伦不知道自己的感受，他看起来像往常一样安静而和蔼可亲。他的和蔼可亲，甚至让她对他产生了残忍的感觉。

She went into his room when he was partially undressed. She did not notice the curious, glad gleam of pure hatred, with which he looked at her. She stood near the door, with her hand behind her.
当他半脱衣服时，她走进了他的房间。她没有注意到他看着她的眼神中流露出好奇而愉快的纯粹仇恨的光芒。她站在门边，手背在身后。

‘I have been thinking, Gerald,’ she said, with an insulting nonchalance, ‘that I shall not go back to England.’
“杰拉尔德，我一直在想，”她带着一种侮辱性的冷漠说道，“我不会再回英国了。”

‘Oh,’ he said, ‘where will you go then?’
“哦，”他说，“那你要去哪里？”

But she ignored his question. She had her own logical statement to make, and it must be made as she had thought it.
但她忽略了他的问题。她有她自己的逻辑陈述要做，而且必须按照她的想法去做。

‘I can’t see the use of going back,’ she continued. ‘It is over between me and you—‘
“我看不出回去有什么用，”她继续说道。 “我和你之间已经结束了——”

She paused for him to speak. But he said nothing. He was only talking to himself, saying ‘Over, is it? I believe it is over. But it isn’t finished. Remember, it isn’t finished. We must put some sort of a finish on it. There must be a conclusion, there must be finality.’
她停下来等他说话。但他什么也没说。他只是自言自语，说‘结束了，是吗？我相信一切都结束了。但这还没有完成。请记住，它还没有完成。我们必须对它进行某种处理。必须有一个结论，必须有最终结果。

So he talked to himself, but aloud he said nothing whatever.
于是他自言自语，但什么也没说。

‘What has been, has been,’ she continued. ‘There is nothing that I regret. I hope you regret nothing—‘
“过去的就是过去的，”她继续说道。 ‘没有什么让我后悔的。我希望你不会后悔——”

She waited for him to speak.
她等着他说话。

‘Oh, I regret nothing,’ he said, accommodatingly.
“哦，我不后悔，”他和蔼地说。

‘Good then,’ she answered, ‘good then. Then neither of us cherishes any regrets, which is as it should be.’
“那就好，”她回答，“那就好。”那么我们谁都不会后悔，这是理所应当的。”

‘Quite as it should be,’ he said aimlessly.
“本来就应该这样，”他漫无目的地说道。

She paused to gather up her thread again.
她停下来，再次收拾线头。

‘Our attempt has been a failure,’ she said. ‘But we can try again, elsewhere.’
“我们的尝试失败了，”她说。 “但我们可以在其他地方再试一次。”

A little flicker of rage ran through his blood. It was as if she were rousing him, goading him. Why must she do it?
他的血液里流淌着一丝愤怒。就好像她在唤醒他、刺激他。为什么她必须这么做？

‘Attempt at what?’ he asked.
“尝试什么？”他问道。

‘At being lovers, I suppose,’ she said, a little baffled, yet so trivial she made it all seem.
“我想，是作为恋人吧，”她说，有点困惑，但她让这一切显得如此微不足道。

‘Our attempt at being lovers has been a failure?’ he repeated aloud.
“我们做恋人的尝试失败了？”他大声重复道。

To himself he was saying, ‘I ought to kill her here. There is only this left, for me to kill her.’ A heavy, overcharged desire to bring about her death possessed him. She was unaware.
他对自己说：‘我应该在这里杀了她。我只剩下这个了，那就是杀了她。”一种沉重的、过度强烈的想要杀死她的欲望占据了他。她浑然不知。

‘Hasn’t it?’ she asked. ‘Do you think it has been a success?’
“不是吗？”她问。 “你认为这成功了吗？”

Again the insult of the flippant question ran through his blood like a current of fire.
这个轻率问题带来的侮辱再次像一股火流一样流过他的血液。

‘It had some of the elements of success, our relationship,’ he replied. ‘It—might have come off.’
他回答说：“我们的关系有一些成功的要素。” “它——可能已经脱落了。”

But he paused before concluding the last phrase. Even as he began the sentence, he did not believe in what he was going to say. He knew it never could have been a success.
但他在说完最后一句话之前停顿了一下。即使在他开始说话的时候，他也不相信自己要说的话。他知道这永远不可能成功。

‘No,’ she replied. ‘You cannot love.’
“不，”她回答道。 “你无法爱。”

‘And you?’ he asked.
“你呢？”他问道。

Her wide, dark-filled eyes were fixed on him, like two moons of darkness.
她那双漆黑的大眼睛死死地盯着他，就像两轮黑暗的月亮。

‘I couldn’t love YOU,’ she said, with stark cold truth.
“我不可能爱你，”她冷酷地说道。

A blinding flash went over his brain, his body jolted. His heart had burst into flame. His consciousness was gone into his wrists, into his hands. He was one blind, incontinent desire, to kill her. His wrists were bursting, there would be no satisfaction till his hands had closed on her.
脑中闪过一道耀眼的光芒，他的身体猛然一震。他的心已经燃烧起来。他的意识进入了他的手腕，进入了他的双手。他有一种盲目的、失禁的欲望，想要杀死她。他的手腕快要爆裂了，除非他的双手合上她，否则他不会感到满足。

But even before his body swerved forward on her, a sudden, cunning comprehension was expressed on her face, and in a flash she was out of the door. She ran in one flash to her room and locked herself in. She was afraid, but confident. She knew her life trembled on the edge of an abyss. But she was curiously sure of her footing. She knew her cunning could outwit him.
但还没等他的身体转向她，她的脸上就突然流露出狡黠的神色，转眼间她就出了门。她飞快地跑回自己的房间，把自己锁在里面。她很害怕，但又很自信。她知道她的生命在深渊的边缘颤抖。但她对自己的立足点非常确定。她知道她的狡猾可以智胜他。

She trembled, as she stood in her room, with excitement and awful exhilaration. She knew she could outwit him. She could depend on her presence of mind, and on her wits. But it was a fight to the death, she knew it now. One slip, and she was lost. She had a strange, tense, exhilarated sickness in her body, as one who is in peril of falling from a great height, but who does not look down, does not admit the fear.
当她站在自己的房间里时，她浑身发抖，兴奋极了。她知道她能智胜他。她可以依靠自己的冷静和智慧。但这是一场你死我活的战斗，她现在知道了。一失足，她就迷失了。她的身体里有一种奇怪的、紧张的、兴奋的感觉，就像一个人面临着从高处坠落的危险，但不往下看，就不承认这种恐惧。

‘I will go away the day after tomorrow,’ she said.
“我后天就走，”她说。

She only did not want Gerald to think that she was afraid of him, that she was running away because she was afraid of him. She was not afraid of him, fundamentally. She knew it was her safeguard to avoid his physical violence. But even physically she was not afraid of him. She wanted to prove it to him. When she had proved it, that, whatever he was, she was not afraid of him; when she had proved THAT, she could leave him forever. But meanwhile the fight between them, terrible as she knew it to be, was inconclusive. And she wanted to be confident in herself. However many terrors she might have, she would be unafraid, uncowed by him. He could never cow her, nor dominate her, nor have any right over her; this she would maintain until she had proved it. Once it was proved, she was free of him forever.
她只是不想让杰拉尔德认为她害怕他，因为她害怕他而逃跑。她根本就不怕他。她知道这是她避免他的身体暴力的保障。但即使是身体上，她也不怕他。她想向他证明这一点。当她证明了这一点后，无论他是什么，她都不怕他。当她证明这一点时，她就可以永远离开他了。但与此同时，他们之间的斗争虽然她知道是可怕的，却没有结果。她想对自己有信心。无论她有多少恐惧，她都不会害怕，不会被他吓倒。他永远不能威吓她，不能支配她，更不能凌驾于她之上。她将坚持这一点，直到她证明这一点。一旦事实证明，她就永远摆脱了他。

But she had not proved it yet, neither to him nor to herself. And this was what still bound her to him. She was bound to him, she could not live beyond him. She sat up in bed, closely wrapped up, for many hours, thinking endlessly to herself. It was as if she would never have done weaving the great provision of her thoughts.
但她还没有向他或她自己证明这一点。这就是她仍然与他联系在一起的原因。她已经被他束缚住了，她无法离开他而活。她在床上坐起来，裹得严严实实，一连好几个小时，无休无止地思考着。就好像她永远不会完成她思想的伟大准备。

‘It isn’t as if he really loved me,’ she said to herself. ‘He doesn’t. Every woman he comes across he wants to make her in love with him. He doesn’t even know that he is doing it. But there he is, before every woman he unfurls his male attractiveness, displays his great desirability, he tries to make every woman think how wonderful it would be to have him for a lover. His very ignoring of the women is part of the game. He is never UNCONSCIOUS of them. He should have been a cockerel, so he could strut before fifty females, all his subjects. But really, his Don Juan does NOT interest me. I could play Dona Juanita a million times better than he plays Juan. He bores me, you know. His maleness bores me. Nothing is so boring, so inherently stupid and stupidly conceited. Really, the fathomless conceit of these men, it is ridiculous—the little strutters.
“他并不是真的爱我，”她对自己说。 “他不知道。”他遇到的每一个女人，他都想让她爱上他。他甚至不知道他正在这样做。但他就在那里，在向每个女人展示他的男性魅力、展现他巨大的欲望之前，他试图让每个女人都觉得有他做情人该多好。他对女性的忽视也是游戏的一部分。他从来没有忽视过他们。他应该是一只小公鸡，这样他就可以在他所有的臣民五十个雌性面前昂首阔步。但实际上，我对他的《唐璜》不感兴趣。我扮演唐娜胡安妮塔比他扮演胡安好一百万倍。他让我厌烦，你知道的。他的男性气概令我厌烦。没有什么比这更无聊、更愚蠢、更愚蠢的自负了。真的，这些人的深不可测的自负，太可笑了——小结巴。

‘They are all alike. Look at Birkin. Built out of the limitation of conceit they are, and nothing else. Really, nothing but their ridiculous limitation and intrinsic insignificance could make them so conceited.
‘他们都很相似。看看柏金包。它们是出于自负的限制而建造的，除此之外别无其他。确实，除了他们可笑的局限性和内在的微不足道之外，没有什么能让他们如此自负。

‘As for Loerke, there is a thousand times more in him than in a Gerald. Gerald is so limited, there is a dead end to him. He would grind on at the old mills forever. And really, there is no corn between the millstones any more. They grind on and on, when there is nothing to grind—saying the same things, believing the same things, acting the same things. Oh, my God, it would wear out the patience of a stone.
“至于洛克，他的魅力比杰拉德强一千倍。杰拉德的能力如此有限，他已经走进了死胡同。他将永远在老磨坊里磨磨蹭蹭。事实上，磨盘之间已经不再有玉米了。当没有什么可磨的时候，他们就继续磨磨蹭蹭——说同样的事情，相信同样的事情，做同样的事情。天哪，这会耗尽石头的耐心。

‘I don’t worship Loerke, but at any rate, he is a free individual. He is not stiff with conceit of his own maleness. He is not grinding dutifully at the old mills. Oh God, when I think of Gerald, and his work—those offices at Beldover, and the mines—it makes my heart sick. What HAVE I to do with it—and him thinking he can be a lover to a woman! One might as well ask it of a self-satisfied lamp-post. These men, with their eternal jobs—and their eternal mills of God that keep on grinding at nothing! It is too boring, just boring. However did I come to take him seriously at all!
“我不崇拜洛克，但无论如何，他是一个自由的个体。他并不因自己的男性自负而僵硬。他没有在旧磨坊尽职尽责地磨削。天哪，当我想到杰拉尔德和他的工作——贝尔多弗的那些办公室和矿井——我的心就感到恶心。我和这有什么关系——而他还以为自己可以成为一个女人的情人！人们不妨向一根自鸣得意的灯柱去问它。这些人，带着他们永恒的工作——以及他们永恒的上帝磨坊，不断地磨砺着一切！实在是太无聊了，简直太无聊了。但我到底有没有认真对待他！

‘At least in Dresden, one will have one’s back to it all. And there will be amusing things to do. It will be amusing to go to these eurythmic displays, and the German opera, the German theatre. It WILL be amusing to take part in German Bohemian life. And Loerke is an artist, he is a free individual. One will escape from so much, that is the chief thing, escape so much hideous boring repetition of vulgar actions, vulgar phrases, vulgar postures. I don’t delude myself that I shall find an elixir of life in Dresden. I know I shan’t. But I shall get away from people who have their own homes and their own children and their own acquaintances and their own this and their own that. I shall be among people who DON’T own things and who HAVEN’T got a home and a domestic servant in the background, who haven’t got a standing and a status and a degree and a circle of friends of the same. Oh God, the wheels within wheels of people, it makes one’s head tick like a clock, with a very madness of dead mechanical monotony and meaninglessness. How I HATE life, how I hate it. How I hate the Geralds, that they can offer one nothing else.
“至少在德累斯顿，人们会支持这一切。并且会有有趣的事情要做。去看这些优美的表演、德国歌剧、德国剧院会很有趣。参与德国波西米亚生活会很有趣。而洛克是一位艺术家，他是一个自由的个体。一个人将摆脱这么多，这是最重要的事情，摆脱这么多粗俗的动作，粗俗的短语，粗俗的姿势的可怕无聊的重复。我并没有欺骗自己，我会在德累斯顿找到长生不老药。我知道我不会。但我会远离那些有自己的家、自己的孩子、自己的熟人、拥有这个、自己那个的人。我将属于那些没有财产、没有家、没有佣人、没有地位、没有学位、没有朋友圈的人。哦上帝，人们的轮子里的轮子，它让一个人的头像时钟一样滴答作响，带着一种死机械的单调和无意义的疯狂。我多么讨厌生活，我多么讨厌它。我多么讨厌杰拉尔德一家，他们除此之外别无他法。

‘Shortlands!—Heavens! Think of living there, one week, then the next, and THEN THE THIRD—
“肖特兰兹！——天哪！想想住在那里，一周，然后下一周，然后第三周——

‘No, I won’t think of it—it is too much.’
“不，我不会想——太多了。”

And she broke off, really terrified, really unable to bear any more.
她突然停了下来，真的很害怕，真的无法再承受了。

The thought of the mechanical succession of day following day, day following day, AD INFINITUM, was one of the things that made her heart palpitate with a real approach of madness. The terrible bondage of this tick-tack of time, this twitching of the hands of the clock, this eternal repetition of hours and days—oh God, it was too awful to contemplate. And there was no escape from it, no escape.
日复一日、日复一日、无穷无尽的机械连续的想法是让她的心因真正的疯狂而颤动的事情之一。时间的滴答作响、时钟指针的抽动、小时和日子的永恒重复——天哪，这太可怕了，无法想象。而且无法逃脱，无法逃脱。

She almost wished Gerald were with her to save her from the terror of her own thoughts. Oh, how she suffered, lying there alone, confronted by the terrible clock, with its eternal tick-tack. All life, all life resolved itself into this: tick-tack, tick-tack, tick-tack; then the striking of the hour; then the tick-tack, tick-tack, and the twitching of the clock-fingers.
她几乎希望杰拉德能和她在一起，把她从自己的想法的恐惧中拯救出来。哦，她多么痛苦，独自躺在那里，面对着那只可怕的时钟，它永远滴答作响。所有的生命，所有的生命都归结为这样：滴答，滴答，滴答；然后是报时；然后是滴答声、滴答声，还有时钟指针的抽动声。

Gerald could not save her from it. He, his body, his motion, his life—it was the same ticking, the same twitching across the dial, a horrible mechanical twitching forward over the face of the hours. What were his kisses, his embraces. She could hear their tick-tack, tick-tack.
杰拉尔德无法将她从困境中拯救出来。他、他的身体、他的动作、他的生活——表盘上都是同样的滴答声、同样的抽动，一种可怕的机械装置在小时的表面上向前抽动。他的吻、他的拥抱是什么？她能听到它们的滴答声、滴答声。

Ha—ha—she laughed to herself, so frightened that she was trying to laugh it off—ha—ha, how maddening it was, to be sure, to be sure!
哈哈哈——她自顾自地笑了，吓得她想一笑而过——哈哈哈，这真是令人抓狂，当然，当然！

Then, with a fleeting self-conscious motion, she wondered if she would be very much surprised, on rising in the morning, to realise that her hair had turned white. She had FELT it turning white so often, under the intolerable burden of her thoughts, und her sensations. Yet there it remained, brown as ever, and there she was herself, looking a picture of health.
然后，她不自在地想到，早上起床时，她会不会感到非常惊讶，发现自己的头发已经变白了。在她的思想和感觉的难以忍受的负担下，她经常感觉到它变白了。但它仍然在那里，一如既往的棕色，而她就在那里，看起来很健康。

Perhaps she was healthy. Perhaps it was only her unabateable health that left her so exposed to the truth. If she were sickly she would have her illusions, imaginations. As it was, there was no escape. She must always see and know and never escape. She could never escape. There she was, placed before the clock-face of life. And if she turned round as in a railway station, to look at the bookstall, still she could see, with her very spine, she could see the clock, always the great white clock-face. In vain she fluttered the leaves of books, or made statuettes in clay. She knew she was not REALLY reading. She was not REALLY working. She was watching the fingers twitch across the eternal, mechanical, monotonous clock-face of time. She never really lived, she only watched. Indeed, she was like a little, twelve-hour clock, vis-a-vis with the enormous clock of eternity—there she was, like Dignity and Impudence, or Impudence and Dignity.
也许她很健康。也许只是她不可逆转的健康状况才让她如此暴露在真相之下。如果她生病了，她就会产生幻想、幻想。事已至此，已经无路可逃了。她必须始终看到并知道并且永远不会逃避。她永远无法逃脱。她就在那里，被放置在生活的钟面前。如果她像在火车站一样转身看书摊，她仍然可以看到，用她的脊椎，她可以看到时钟，总是巨大的白色钟面。她徒劳地挥动书页，或用粘土制作小雕像。她知道她并没有真正读书。她并没有真正工作。她看着手指在永恒、机械、单调的时间钟面上抽动。她从未真正生活过，她只是看着。事实上，她就像一个十二小时的小时钟，与永恒的巨大时钟相对——她就在那里，就像尊严与无礼，或者无耻与尊严。

The picture pleased her. Didn’t her face really look like a clock dial—rather roundish and often pale, and impassive. She would have got up to look, in the mirror, but the thought of the sight of her own face, that was like a twelve-hour clock-dial, filled her with such deep terror, that she hastened to think of something else.
这张照片让她很高兴。她的脸不是真的看起来像一个钟盘吗——相当圆润，常常苍白，而且面无表情。她本想站起来照照镜子，但一想到自己的脸，就像十二小时的钟盘，她就充满了深深的恐惧，以至于她赶紧想到别的事情。

Oh, why wasn’t somebody kind to her? Why wasn’t there somebody who would take her in their arms, and hold her to their breast, and give her rest, pure, deep, healing rest. Oh, why wasn’t there somebody to take her in their arms and fold her safe and perfect, for sleep. She wanted so much this perfect enfolded sleep. She lay always so unsheathed in sleep. She would lie always unsheathed in sleep, unrelieved, unsaved. Oh, how could she bear it, this endless unrelief, this eternal unrelief.
哦，为什么没有人善待她呢？为什么没有人将她抱在怀里，将她抱在怀里，让她得到休息，纯净、深刻、治愈的休息。哦，为什么没有人把她抱在怀里，把她安全完美地折叠起来睡觉。她非常想要这种完美的拥抱睡眠。她总是赤裸裸地躺在床上睡觉。她总是赤身裸体地躺在床上，无法释怀，无法得救。哦，她怎么受得了，这种无尽的不解脱，这种永远的不解脱。

Gerald! Could he fold her in his arms and sheathe her in sleep? Ha! He needed putting to sleep himself—poor Gerald. That was all he needed. What did he do, he made the burden for her greater, the burden of her sleep was the more intolerable, when he was there. He was an added weariness upon her unripening nights, her unfruitful slumbers. Perhaps he got some repose from her. Perhaps he did. Perhaps this was what he was always dogging her for, like a child that is famished, crying for the breast. Perhaps this was the secret of his passion, his forever unquenched desire for her—that he needed her to put him to sleep, to give him repose.
杰拉德！他能把她搂在怀里，哄她入睡吗？哈！他需要自己入睡——可怜的杰拉德。这就是他所需要的。他做了什么，他让她的负担更加沉重，当他在场的时候，她的睡眠负担更加难以忍受。他给她未成熟的夜晚、她毫无结果的睡眠增添了更多的疲倦。也许他从她那里得到了一些休息。也许他做到了。也许这就是他一直缠着她的原因，就像一个饥饿的孩子，哭着要吃奶一样。也许这就是他激情的秘密，他对她永远无法抑制的渴望——他需要她让他入睡，让他休息。

What then! Was she his mother? Had she asked for a child, whom she must nurse through the nights, for her lover. She despised him, she despised him, she hardened her heart. An infant crying in the night, this Don Juan.
然后怎样呢！她是他的母亲吗？如果她要求为她的爱人生一个孩子，她必须整晚照顾他。她鄙视他，她鄙视他，她铁石心肠。一个婴儿在夜里哭泣，这个唐璜。

Ooh, but how she hated the infant crying in the night. She would murder it gladly. She would stifle it and bury it, as Hetty Sorrell did. No doubt Hetty Sorrell’s infant cried in the night—no doubt Arthur Donnithorne’s infant would. Ha—the Arthur Donnithornes, the Geralds of this world. So manly by day, yet all the while, such a crying of infants in the night. Let them turn into mechanisms, let them. Let them become instruments, pure machines, pure wills, that work like clock-work, in perpetual repetition. Let them be this, let them be taken up entirely in their work, let them be perfect parts of a great machine, having a slumber of constant repetition. Let Gerald manage his firm. There he would be satisfied, as satisfied as a wheelbarrow that goes backwards and forwards along a plank all day—she had seen it.
哦，但是她多么讨厌婴儿在夜里哭啊。她很乐意杀掉它。她会扼杀它并埋葬它，就像海蒂·索雷尔所做的那样。毫无疑问，海蒂·索雷尔的婴儿会在夜里哭泣——毫无疑问，阿瑟·唐尼索恩的婴儿也会。哈——亚瑟·唐尼索恩斯，这个世界的杰拉尔德家族。白天如此有男子气概，但夜间却始终传来婴儿的哭声。让他们变成机制，让他们吧。让它们成为工具、纯粹的机器、纯粹的意志，像钟表一样工作，永远重复。让他们成为这样，让他们全身心地投入到工作中，让他们成为一台伟大机器的完美部件，在不断重复的睡眠中。让杰拉德管理他的公司。在那里他会很满足，就像一辆独轮车整天沿着木板来回走动一样满足——她已经看到了。

The wheel-barrow—the one humble wheel—the unit of the firm. Then the cart, with two wheels; then the truck, with four; then the donkey-engine, with eight, then the winding-engine, with sixteen, and so on, till it came to the miner, with a thousand wheels, and then the electrician, with three thousand, and the underground manager, with twenty thousand, and the general manager with a hundred thousand little wheels working away to complete his make-up, and then Gerald, with a million wheels and cogs and axles.
手推车——一个不起眼的轮子——是公司的单位。然后是有两个轮子的手推车；然后是卡车，有四个人；然后是驴机，有八个，然后是绕线机，有十六个，依此类推，直到矿工有一千个轮子，然后是电工，有三千个轮子，还有地下管理人员，有二十个轮子。一千个，总经理带着十万个小轮子忙着完成他的化妆，然后是杰拉德，带着一百万个轮子、齿轮和车轴。

Poor Gerald, such a lot of little wheels to his make-up! He was more intricate than a chronometer-watch. But oh heavens, what weariness! What weariness, God above! A chronometer-watch—a beetle—her soul fainted with utter ennui, from the thought. So many wheels to count and consider and calculate! Enough, enough—there was an end to man’s capacity for complications, even. Or perhaps there was no end.
可怜的杰拉德，他的化妆品里有那么多小轮子！他比天文钟表还要复杂。但是天啊，多么疲倦啊！多么疲倦啊，天上的上帝啊！一只天文钟表——一只甲虫——想到这里，她的灵魂因彻底的厌倦而昏厥过去。这么多轮子需要计数、考虑和计算！够了，够了——甚至人类处理并发症的能力也已经结束了。或者也许没有尽头。

Meanwhile Gerald sat in his room, reading. When Gudrun was gone, he was left stupefied with arrested desire. He sat on the side of the bed for an hour, stupefied, little strands of consciousness appearing and reappearing. But he did not move, for a long time he remained inert, his head dropped on his breast.
与此同时，杰拉尔德坐在自己的房间里读书。古德伦离开后，他因欲望被抑制而感到震惊。他在床边坐了一个小时，目瞪口呆，一丝丝意识不断出现。但他一动不动，很长一段时间一动不动，头低垂在胸前。

Then he looked up and realised that he was going to bed. He was cold. Soon he was lying down in the dark.
然后他抬起头，发现自己要去睡觉了。他很冷。很快，他就躺在了黑暗中。

But what he could not bear was the darkness. The solid darkness confronting him drove him mad. So he rose, and made a light. He remained seated for a while, staring in front. He did not think of Gudrun, he did not think of anything.
但他无法忍受的是黑暗。眼前的黑暗让他发疯。于是他站起来，点了盏灯。他坐了一会儿，眼睛盯着前方。他没有想到古珍，他没有想到任何事情。

Then suddenly he went downstairs for a book. He had all his life been in terror of the nights that should come, when he could not sleep. He knew that this would be too much for him, to have to face nights of sleeplessness and of horrified watching the hours.
然后他突然下楼去拿书。他一生都对即将到来的夜晚感到恐惧，因为那时他无法入睡。他知道这对他来说太过分了，他不得不面对失眠的夜晚和惊恐地看着时间。

So he sat for hours in bed, like a statue, reading. His mind, hard and acute, read on rapidly, his body understood nothing. In a state of rigid unconsciousness, he read on through the night, till morning, when, weary and disgusted in spirit, disgusted most of all with himself, he slept for two hours.
于是他像一尊雕像一样在床上坐了几个小时，读书。他的头脑坚硬而敏锐，快速地阅读着，但他的身体却一无所知。他在一种完全没有意识的状态下读了一夜，直到早上，精神上又疲倦又厌恶，尤其是对自己感到厌恶，他睡了两个小时。

Then he got up, hard and full of energy. Gudrun scarcely spoke to him, except at coffee when she said:
然后他站了起来，身体很硬，精力充沛。古德伦几乎不跟他说话，除了喝咖啡时她说：

‘I shall be leaving tomorrow.’
“我明天就要离开。”

‘We will go together as far as Innsbruck, for appearance’s sake?’ he asked.
“为了面子，我们会一起去到因斯布鲁克吗？”他问道。

‘Perhaps,’ she said.
“也许吧，”她说。

She said ‘Perhaps’ between the sips of her coffee. And the sound of her taking her breath in the word, was nauseous to him. He rose quickly to be away from her.
她一边喝咖啡，一边说“也许”。她听到这个词时呼吸的声音让他感到恶心。他迅速起身，远离她。

He went and made arrangements for the departure on the morrow. Then, taking some food, he set out for the day on the skis. Perhaps, he said to the Wirt, he would go up to the Marienhutte, perhaps to the village below.
他去安排了第二天的出发事宜。然后，他带了一些食物，开始滑雪。他对沃特人说，也许他会去玛丽恩胡特，也许去下面的村庄。

To Gudrun this day was full of a promise like spring. She felt an approaching release, a new fountain of life rising up in her. It gave her pleasure to dawdle through her packing, it gave her pleasure to dip into books, to try on her different garments, to look at herself in the glass. She felt a new lease of life was come upon her, and she was happy like a child, very attractive and beautiful to everybody, with her soft, luxuriant figure, and her happiness. Yet underneath was death itself.
对于古珍来说，这一天充满了春天般的希望。她感到一种释放即将到来，一股新的生命之泉在她体内升起。她很高兴磨磨蹭蹭地收拾行李，翻阅书籍，试穿不同的衣服，看着镜子里的自己，这让她很高兴。她感觉自己迎来了新的生命，她像个孩子一样快乐，对每个人来说都很有吸引力和美丽，她的身材柔软、华丽，她的幸福。然而下面却是死亡本身。

In the afternoon she had to go out with Loerke. Her tomorrow was perfectly vague before her. This was what gave her pleasure. She might be going to England with Gerald, she might be going to Dresden with Loerke, she might be going to Munich, to a girl-friend she had there. Anything might come to pass on the morrow. And today was the white, snowy iridescent threshold of all possibility. All possibility—that was the charm to her, the lovely, iridescent, indefinite charm,—pure illusion All possibility—because death was inevitable, and NOTHING was possible but death.
下午她必须和洛克一起出去。她的明天在她面前完全模糊。这就是让她高兴的事情。她可能会和杰拉尔德一起去英国，她可能会和洛克一起去德累斯顿，她可能会去慕尼黑，去找她在那里的女朋友。明天任何事情都可能发生。今天是所有可能性的白色、雪白虹彩的门槛。所有的可能性——这就是她的魅力，可爱的、虹彩的、不确定的魅力——纯粹的幻觉所有的可能性——因为死亡是不可避免的，除了死亡，没有什么是可能的。

She did not want things to materialise, to take any definite shape. She wanted, suddenly, at one moment of the journey tomorrow, to be wafted into an utterly new course, by some utterly unforeseen event, or motion. So that, although she wanted to go out with Loerke for the last time into the snow, she did not want to be serious or businesslike.
她不希望事情变成现实，不希望事情变成任何确定的形状。她突然想要在明天旅程的某个时刻，被某种完全无法预见的事件或动作带入一个全新的航向。所以，虽然她想最后一次和洛尔克一起出去雪地里，但她不想严肃或公事公办。

And Loerke was not a serious figure. In his brown velvet cap, that made his head as round as a chestnut, with the brown-velvet flaps loose and wild over his ears, and a wisp of elf-like, thin black hair blowing above his full, elf-like dark eyes, the shiny, transparent brown skin crinkling up into odd grimaces on his small-featured face, he looked an odd little boy-man, a bat. But in his figure, in the greeny loden suit, he looked CHETIF and puny, still strangely different from the rest.
洛克并不是一个严肃的人物。戴着棕色天鹅绒帽子，他的头像栗子一样圆，棕色天鹅绒的耳垂宽松而狂野地盖在他的耳朵上，一缕精灵般的细黑发在他饱满的、精灵般的黑眼睛上方飘扬。闪亮、透明的棕色皮肤在他那张小脸上皱成奇怪的鬼脸，他看起来是一个奇怪的小男孩，一只蝙蝠。但从他的身材来看，穿着绿色的洛登呢西装，他看起来像切蒂夫，身材矮小，仍然与其他人有奇怪的不同。

He had taken a little toboggan, for the two of them, and they trudged between the blinding slopes of snow, that burned their now hardening faces, laughing in an endless sequence of quips and jests and polyglot fancies. The fancies were the reality to both of them, they were both so happy, tossing about the little coloured balls of verbal humour and whimsicality. Their natures seemed to sparkle in full interplay, they were enjoying a pure game. And they wanted to keep it on the level of a game, their relationship: SUCH a fine game.
他为他们两个带了一辆小平底雪橇，他们在令人眼花缭乱的雪坡之间艰难前行，雪烧伤了他们现在变得冷硬的脸，他们大笑起来，无休无止的俏皮话、玩笑和多种语言的幻想。对他们俩来说，幻想都是现实，他们都很高兴，抛掷着言语幽默和异想天开的小彩球。他们的天性似乎在充分的相互作用中闪闪发光，他们正在享受一场纯粹的游戏。他们希望将其保持在游戏的水平上，他们的关系：真是一场精彩的游戏。

Loerke did not take the toboganning very seriously. He put no fire and intensity into it, as Gerald did. Which pleased Gudrun. She was weary, oh so weary of Gerald’s gripped intensity of physical motion. Loerke let the sledge go wildly, and gaily, like a flying leaf, and when, at a bend, he pitched both her and him out into the snow, he only waited for them both to pick themselves up unhurt off the keen white ground, to be laughing and pert as a pixie. She knew he would be making ironical, playful remarks as he wandered in hell—if he were in the humour. And that pleased her immensely. It seemed like a rising above the dreariness of actuality, the monotony of contingencies.
洛克并没有很认真地对待平底雪橇。他没有像杰拉德那样投入热情和强度。这让古德伦很高兴。她很疲倦，哦，对杰拉尔德紧张的身体动作感到厌倦。洛尔克让雪橇疯狂而快乐地前进，就像一片飞舞的树叶，当他在一个弯道时，他把她和他扔进雪地里，他只等他们俩毫发无伤地从尖锐的白色地面上爬起来，像小精灵一样欢笑、活泼。她知道，如果他幽默的话，当他在地狱中徘徊时，他会说一些讽刺、俏皮的话。这让她非常高兴。这似乎超越了现实的沉闷和偶然事件的单调。

They played till the sun went down, in pure amusement, careless and timeless. Then, as the little sledge twirled riskily to rest at the bottom of the slope,
他们玩得很开心，直到太阳落山，漫不经心，而且永恒。然后，当小雪橇危险地旋转着停在斜坡底部时，

‘Wait!’ he said suddenly, and he produced from somewhere a large thermos flask, a packet of Keks, and a bottle of Schnapps.
“等等！”他突然说道，然后从某处拿出一个大保温瓶、一包 Keks 啤酒和一瓶杜松子酒。

‘Oh Loerke,’ she cried. ‘What an inspiration! What a COMBLE DE JOIE INDEED! What is the Schnapps?’
“噢，洛克，”她喊道。 ‘多么鼓舞人心啊！确实是多么美味的COMBLE DE JOIE！什么是杜松子酒？

He looked at it, and laughed.
他看着它，笑了。

‘Heidelbeer!’ he said.
“海德比尔！”他说。

‘No! From the bilberries under the snow. Doesn’t it look as if it were distilled from snow. Can you—‘ she sniffed, and sniffed at the bottle—‘can you smell bilberries? Isn’t it wonderful? It is exactly as if one could smell them through the snow.’
'不！来自雪下的越橘。看起来不像是从雪中蒸馏出来的。你能——”她吸了吸鼻子，又吸了吸瓶子——“你能闻到越橘的味道吗？是不是很美妙？就好像人们可以透过雪地闻到它们的味道一样。

She stamped her foot lightly on the ground. He kneeled down and whistled, and put his ear to the snow. As he did so his black eyes twinkled up.
她轻轻地用脚踩在地上。他跪下来吹口哨，把耳朵贴在雪上。当他这样做时，他的黑眼睛闪闪发光。

‘Ha! Ha!’ she laughed, warmed by the whimsical way in which he mocked at her verbal extravagances. He was always teasing her, mocking her ways. But as he in his mockery was even more absurd than she in her extravagances, what could one do but laugh and feel liberated.
'哈！哈！”她笑了，他嘲笑她言语上的奢侈行为的异想天开的方式让她感到温暖。他总是捉弄她，嘲笑她的做法。但他的嘲讽比她的铺张更荒唐，除了笑一笑，也能感到一种解脱。

She could feel their voices, hers and his, ringing silvery like bells in the frozen, motionless air of the first twilight. How perfect it was, how VERY perfect it was, this silvery isolation and interplay.
她能感觉到他们的声音，她的和他的，在初暮的冰冷、静止的空气中像铃铛一样响起。这是多么完美，多么非常完美，这种银色的隔离和相互作用。

She sipped the hot coffee, whose fragrance flew around them like bees murmuring around flowers, in the snowy air, she drank tiny sips of the Heidelbeerwasser, she ate the cold, sweet, creamy wafers. How good everything was! How perfect everything tasted and smelled and sounded, here in this utter stillness of snow and falling twilight.
她喝着热咖啡，香气在她们周围飞舞，就像蜜蜂在花朵周围低语一样，在雪天里，她喝了一小口海德啤酒啤酒，吃着冰凉、香甜、奶油味的威化饼。一切多么美好啊！在雪花和暮色的完全寂静中，一切的味道、气味和声音是多么完美。

‘You are going away tomorrow?’ his voice came at last.
“你明天就要走吗？”他的声音终于传来。

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

There was a pause, when the evening seemed to rise in its silent, ringing pallor infinitely high, to the infinite which was near at hand.
有一个停顿，傍晚似乎在寂静、苍白中升到无限高，直到近在眼前的无限。

‘WOHIN?’
“哇？”

That was the question—WOHIN? Whither? WOHIN? What a lovely word! She NEVER wanted it answered. Let it chime for ever.
这就是问题所在——WOHIN？去哪儿？沃欣？多么可爱的词啊！她从来不想回答。让它永远鸣响。

‘I don’t know,’ she said, smiling at him.
“我不知道，”她微笑着对他说。

He caught the smile from her.
他捕捉到了她的微笑。

‘One never does,’ he said.
“从来没有人这样做过，”他说。

‘One never does,’ she repeated.
“从来没有人这样做过，”她重复道。

There was a silence, wherein he ate biscuits rapidly, as a rabbit eats leaves.
一阵沉默，他飞快地吃着饼干，就像兔子吃树叶一样。

‘But,’ he laughed, ‘where will you take a ticket to?’
“但是，”他笑道，“你要买票去哪里？”

‘Oh heaven!’ she cried. ‘One must take a ticket.’
“天啊！”她喊道。 “必须拿票。”

Here was a blow. She saw herself at the wicket, at the railway station. Then a relieving thought came to her. She breathed freely.
这是一个打击。她看到自己在火车站的检票口。然后她想到了一个如释重负的想法。她呼吸自由。

‘But one needn’t go,’ she cried.
“但一个人不必去，”她喊道。

‘Certainly not,’ he said.
“当然不是，”他说。

‘I mean one needn’t go where one’s ticket says.’
“我的意思是，人们不必去票上写的地方。”

That struck him. One might take a ticket, so as not to travel to the destination it indicated. One might break off, and avoid the destination. A point located. That was an idea!
这让他很震惊。人们可能会拿一张车票，以免到达车票所指示的目的地。人们可能会停下来，避开目的地。位于一个点。这是一个想法！

‘Then take a ticket to London,’ he said. ‘One should never go there.’
“那就买一张去伦敦的机票，”他说。 “人们永远不应该去那里。”

‘Right,’ she answered.
“好的，”她回答。

He poured a little coffee into a tin can.
他往锡罐里倒了一点咖啡。

‘You won’t tell me where you will go?’ he asked.
“你不告诉我你要去哪里吗？”他问道。

‘Really and truly,’ she said, ‘I don’t know. It depends which way the wind blows.’
“说实话，”她说，“我不知道。”这取决于风向。

He looked at her quizzically, then he pursed up his lips, like Zephyrus, blowing across the snow.
他疑惑地看着她，然后撅起嘴唇，就像西风吹过雪地一样。

‘It goes towards Germany,’ he said.
“它流向德国，”他说。

‘I believe so,’ she laughed.
“我相信是这样，”她笑道。

Suddenly, they were aware of a vague white figure near them. It was Gerald. Gudrun’s heart leapt in sudden terror, profound terror. She rose to her feet.
突然，他们发现身边有一个模糊的白色人影。是杰拉尔德。古德伦的心因突如其来的恐惧而跳动，深深的恐惧。她站了起来。

‘They told me where you were,’ came Gerald’s voice, like a judgment in the whitish air of twilight.
“他们告诉我你在哪里，”杰拉尔德的声音传来，就像暮色中发白的空气中的审判。

‘MARIA! You come like a ghost,’ exclaimed Loerke.
‘玛丽亚！你像幽灵一样来了。”洛克惊呼道。

Gerald did not answer. His presence was unnatural and ghostly to them.
杰拉德没有回答。他的存在对他们来说是不自然的、幽灵般的。

Loerke shook the flask—then he held it inverted over the snow. Only a few brown drops trickled out.
洛克摇动烧瓶，然后将其倒置在雪上。只有几滴棕色的水滴流了出来。

‘All gone!’ he said.
“全都消失了！”他说。

To Gerald, the smallish, odd figure of the German was distinct and objective, as if seen through field glasses. And he disliked the small figure exceedingly, he wanted it removed.
对杰拉尔德来说，这个德国人身材矮小、古怪，清晰而客观，就像透过望远镜看到的一样。而且他非常不喜欢这个小人物，他想把它去掉。

Then Loerke rattled the box which held the biscuits.
然后洛克把装饼干的盒子弄得嘎嘎作响。

‘Biscuits there are still,’ he said.
“饼干还在，”他说。

And reaching from his seated posture in the sledge, he handed them to Gudrun. She fumbled, and took one. He would have held them to Gerald, but Gerald so definitely did not want to be offered a biscuit, that Loerke, rather vaguely, put the box aside. Then he took up the small bottle, and held it to the light.
他从雪橇上坐起，将它们递给古德伦。她摸索着，拿了一张。他本想把它们交给杰拉德，但杰拉德绝对不想别人给他一块饼干，因此洛尔克含糊地把盒子放在一边。然后他拿起小瓶子，把它举到灯光下。

‘Also there is some Schnapps,’ he said to himself.
“还有一些杜松子酒，”他自言自语道。

Then suddenly, he elevated the battle gallantly in the air, a strange, grotesque figure leaning towards Gudrun, and said:
突然，他英勇地将战斗举到空中，一个奇异怪诞的身影向古德伦倾斜，说道：

‘Gnadiges Fraulein,’ he said, ‘wohl—‘
“Gnadiges Fraulein，”他说，“哇——”

There was a crack, the bottle was flying, Loerke had started back, the three stood quivering in violent emotion.
一声爆响，瓶子飞了出去，洛尔克向后退了一步，三人站在那里，激动得浑身发抖。

Loerke turned to Gerald, a devilish leer on his bright-skinned face.
洛克转向杰拉德，他那张皮肤明亮的脸上露出邪恶的斜视。

‘Well done!’ he said, in a satirical demoniac frenzy. ‘C’est le sport, sans doute.’
“干得好！”他带着讽刺的恶魔般的狂热说道。 “这就是运动，毫无疑问。”

The next instant he was sitting ludicrously in the snow, Gerald’s fist having rung against the side of his head. But Loerke pulled himself together, rose, quivering, looking full at Gerald, his body weak and furtive, but his eyes demoniacal with satire.
下一瞬间，他滑稽地坐在雪地里，杰拉尔德的拳头敲打着他的头侧。但洛尔克振作起来，站了起来，浑身颤抖，全神贯注地看着杰拉德，他的身体虚弱而鬼鬼祟祟，但他的眼睛却充满了讽刺。

‘Vive le heros, vive—‘
“英雄万岁，万岁——”

But he flinched, as, in a black flash Gerald’s fist came upon him, banged into the other side of his head, and sent him aside like a broken straw.
但他退缩了，杰拉尔德的拳头一闪而过，击中了他的另一侧脑袋，把他像一根折断的稻草一样推到一边。

But Gudrun moved forward. She raised her clenched hand high, and brought it down, with a great downward stroke on to the face and on to the breast of Gerald.
但古德伦继续前进。她把紧握的手高高举起，又放下来，狠狠地向下抚摸着杰拉尔德的脸和胸口。

A great astonishment burst upon him, as if the air had broken. Wide, wide his soul opened, in wonder, feeling the pain. Then it laughed, turning, with strong hands outstretched, at last to take the apple of his desire. At last he could finish his desire.
他心中猛地一惊，仿佛空气都被打破了。他的灵魂大大敞开，惊奇地感受着痛苦。然后它大笑起来，转身，伸出有力的双手，终于拿起了他渴望的苹果。他终于可以完成他的愿望了。

He took the throat of Gudrun between his hands, that were hard and indomitably powerful. And her throat was beautifully, so beautifully soft, save that, within, he could feel the slippery chords of her life. And this he crushed, this he could crush. What bliss! Oh what bliss, at last, what satisfaction, at last! The pure zest of satisfaction filled his soul. He was watching the unconsciousness come unto her swollen face, watching the eyes roll back. How ugly she was! What a fulfilment, what a satisfaction! How good this was, oh how good it was, what a God-given gratification, at last! He was unconscious of her fighting and struggling. The struggling was her reciprocal lustful passion in this embrace, the more violent it became, the greater the frenzy of delight, till the zenith was reached, the crisis, the struggle was overborne, her movement became softer, appeased.
他用双手掐住古德伦的喉咙，那双手坚硬而坚韧。她的喉咙非常美丽，非常柔软，只是在里面，他能感觉到她生命中滑溜溜的和弦。他粉碎了这个，他可以粉碎这个。多么幸福啊！哦，最后是多么幸福啊，最后是多么满足啊！纯粹的满足感充满了他的灵魂。他看着她肿胀的脸失去知觉，看着她的眼睛向后翻。她多么丑啊！这是何等的成就，何等的满足！这真是太好了，哦，这真是太好了，上帝终于给了我们多么大的满足！他没有意识到她的挣扎和挣扎。挣扎是她在这个拥抱中相互的欲望，越是猛烈，喜悦的狂乱就越大，直到达到顶峰，危机、挣扎被压倒，她的动作变得更加柔和、安抚。

Loerke roused himself on the snow, too dazed and hurt to get up. Only his eyes were conscious.
洛尔克在雪地上惊醒过来，他感到头昏眼花、疼痛难忍，无法起身。只有他的眼睛是有意识的。

‘Monsieur!’ he said, in his thin, roused voice: ‘Quand vous aurez fini—‘
“先生！”他用微弱而兴奋的声音说道：“Quand vous aurez fini——”

A revulsion of contempt and disgust came over Gerald’s soul. The disgust went to the very bottom of him, a nausea. Ah, what was he doing, to what depths was he letting himself go! As if he cared about her enough to kill her, to have her life on his hands!
杰拉尔德的心里升起了一种蔑视和厌恶的厌恶。厌恶感直达他的心底，一种恶心。啊，他在做什么，他放纵自己到什么程度了！仿佛他在乎她，恨不得杀了她，恨不得把她的命都掌握在自己手里！

A weakness ran over his body, a terrible relaxing, a thaw, a decay of strength. Without knowing, he had let go his grip, and Gudrun had fallen to her knees. Must he see, must he know?
一种虚弱感席卷了他的全身，一种可怕的放松、一种解冻、一种力量的衰退。不知不觉中，他松开了手，戈珍跪倒在地。他必须看到，他必须知道吗？

A fearful weakness possessed him, his joints were turned to water. He drifted, as on a wind, veered, and went drifting away.
他感到一种可怕的虚弱，他的关节已经变成了水。他就像乘着风一样漂流，转向，然后漂走了。

‘I didn’t want it, really,’ was the last confession of disgust in his soul, as he drifted up the slope, weak, finished, only sheering off unconsciously from any further contact. ‘I’ve had enough—I want to go to sleep. I’ve had enough.’ He was sunk under a sense of nausea.
“我真的不想要它，”这是他灵魂中最后一次对厌恶的忏悔，当他漂上斜坡时，虚弱的，结束了，只是无意识地避开任何进一步的接触。 “我受够了——我想睡觉了。”我已经受够了。”他感到一阵恶心。

He was weak, but he did not want to rest, he wanted to go on and on, to the end. Never again to stay, till he came to the end, that was all the desire that remained to him. So he drifted on and on, unconscious and weak, not thinking of anything, so long as he could keep in action.
他很虚弱，但他不想休息，他想继续走下去，直到最后。不再停留，直到最后，这是他仅存的愿望。于是他就这样漂泊着，昏迷不醒，虚弱不堪，什么也不想，只要能继续行动就可以了。

The twilight spread a weird, unearthly light overhead, bluish-rose in colour, the cold blue night sank on the snow. In the valley below, behind, in the great bed of snow, were two small figures: Gudrun dropped on her knees, like one executed, and Loerke sitting propped up near her. That was all.
暮色在头顶上散布出一种奇怪的、超凡脱俗的光芒，颜色呈蓝玫瑰色，寒冷的蓝色夜色沉入雪地。在下面的山谷里，在后面的大雪床上，有两个小人影：古德伦跪在地上，就像一个被处决的人，洛尔克坐在她旁边。就这些。

Gerald stumbled on up the slope of snow, in the bluish darkness, always climbing, always unconsciously climbing, weary though he was. On his left was a steep slope with black rocks and fallen masses of rock and veins of snow slashing in and about the blackness of rock, veins of snow slashing vaguely in and about the blackness of rock. Yet there was no sound, all this made no noise.
杰拉尔德在蓝色的黑暗中跌跌撞撞地爬上雪坡，尽管他很累，但他总是在无意识地攀爬。他的左边是一个陡峭的斜坡，上面有黑色的岩石和倒塌的岩石，雪的纹理在黑色的岩石中和周围划破，雪的纹理在黑色的岩石中和周围模糊地划破。然而却没有任何声音，这一切都没有发出任何声音。

To add to his difficulty, a small bright moon shone brilliantly just ahead, on the right, a painful brilliant thing that was always there, unremitting, from which there was no escape. He wanted so to come to the end—he had had enough. Yet he did not sleep.
让他更加困难的是，前方右侧有一轮明亮的小月亮，明亮的小月亮一直在那儿，不间断地闪烁着，令人痛苦，无法逃脱。他想就这样结束——他已经受够了。然而他并没有睡觉。

He surged painfully up, sometimes having to cross a slope of black rock, that was blown bare of snow. Here he was afraid of falling, very much afraid of falling. And high up here, on the crest, moved a wind that almost overpowered him with a sleep-heavy iciness. Only it was not here, the end, and he must still go on. His indefinite nausea would not let him stay.
他痛苦地向上冲去，有时不得不穿过一片黑色岩石的斜坡，那里已经被风吹得光秃秃的了。在这里他害怕摔倒，非常害怕摔倒。在高高的山顶上，一阵风吹来，带着令人昏昏欲睡的冰冷，几乎压倒了他。只是这还不是终点，而他还必须继续前进。无限的恶心不允许他留下来。

Having gained one ridge, he saw the vague shadow of something higher in front. Always higher, always higher. He knew he was following the track towards the summit of the slopes, where was the marienhutte, and the descent on the other side. But he was not really conscious. He only wanted to go on, to go on whilst he could, to move, to keep going, that was all, to keep going, until it was finished. He had lost all his sense of place. And yet in the remaining instinct of life, his feet sought the track where the skis had gone.
爬过一座山脊后，他看到前方有更高处的模糊影子。永远更高，永远更高。他知道自己正在沿着小路走向斜坡的顶峰，那里就是玛利亚小屋，而另一边则是下坡路。但他并没有真正的意识。他只想继续走下去，趁他还可以的时候继续走下去，继续前进，继续前进，仅此而已，继续前进，直到完成。他已经失去了所有的地方感。然而，在仅存的生命本能中，他的双脚寻找着滑雪板消失的轨迹。

He slithered down a sheer snow slope. That frightened him. He had no alpenstock, nothing. But having come safely to rest, he began to walk on, in the illuminated darkness. It was as cold as sleep. He was between two ridges, in a hollow. So he swerved. Should he climb the other ridge, or wander along the hollow? How frail the thread of his being was stretched! He would perhaps climb the ridge. The snow was firm and simple. He went along. There was something standing out of the snow. He approached, with dimmest curiosity.
他从陡峭的雪坡上滑下来。这让他害怕。他没有登山杖，什么都没有。但安全地休息后，他开始在明亮的黑暗中继续前行。天气像睡觉一样冷。他在两座山脊之间的一个洼地里。于是他就转向了。他应该爬上另一座山脊，还是沿着山谷漫步？他的生命之线是多么脆弱啊！他也许会爬上山脊。雪又硬又简单。他也跟着去了。有什么东西从雪中矗立起来。他带着一丝好奇走近。

It was a half-buried Crucifix, a little Christ under a little sloping hood, at the top of a pole. He sheered away. Somebody was going to murder him. He had a great dread of being murdered. But it was a dread which stood outside him, like his own ghost.
那是一个半埋的十字架，一个小基督，戴着一个倾斜的小兜帽，位于一根杆子的顶部。他转身走开。有人要谋杀他。他非常害怕被谋杀。但这种恐惧一直存在于他的身外，就像他自己的鬼魂一样。

Yet why be afraid? It was bound to happen. To be murdered! He looked round in terror at the snow, the rocking, pale, shadowy slopes of the upper world. He was bound to be murdered, he could see it. This was the moment when the death was uplifted, and there was no escape.
但为什么要害怕呢？这一定会发生。要被谋杀了！他惊恐地环顾四周，看着雪地，看着上层世界摇摇欲坠、苍白阴暗的山坡。他注定会被谋杀，他看得出来。这是死亡升起的时刻，已经无路可逃。

Lord Jesus, was it then bound to be—Lord Jesus! He could feel the blow descending, he knew he was murdered. Vaguely wandering forward, his hands lifted as if to feel what would happen, he was waiting for the moment when he would stop, when it would cease. It was not over yet.
主耶稣，那么就必然是——主耶稣！他能感觉到打击降临，他知道自己被谋杀了。模模糊糊地向前走着，双手举起，仿佛在预感到将要发生什么，他在等待着他停止的那一刻，停止的那一刻。事情还没有结束。

He had come to the hollow basin of snow, surrounded by sheer slopes and precipices, out of which rose a track that brought one to the top of the mountain. But he wandered unconsciously, till he slipped and fell down, and as he fell something broke in his soul, and immediately he went to sleep.
他来到了一个空心的雪盆地，四周都是陡峭的山坡和悬崖，从那里伸出一条小路，可以把人带到山顶。但他无意识地徘徊着，直到他滑倒了，当他摔倒时，他的灵魂里有什么东西破碎了，他立刻就睡着了。

CHAPTER XXXI
第三十一章

EXEUNT
执行

When they brought the body home, the next morning, Gudrun was shut up in her room. From her window she saw men coming along with a burden, over the snow. She sat still and let the minutes go by.
第二天早上，当他们把尸体带回家时，古德伦被关在自己的房间里。她从窗户里看到男人们背着担子走过雪地。她静静地坐着，让时间流逝。

There came a tap at her door. She opened. There stood a woman, saying softly, oh, far too reverently:
她的门被敲响了。她打开了。站着一个女人，轻声说道，噢，太恭敬了：

‘They have found him, madam!’
“他们找到他了，女士！”

‘Il est mort?’
“我死了吗？”

‘Yes—hours ago.’
“是的——几个小时前。”

Gudrun did not know what to say. What should she say? What should she feel? What should she do? What did they expect of her? She was coldly at a loss.
古珍不知道该说什么。她应该说什么？她应该有什么感受？她该干什么？他们对她有什么期望？她冷然不知所措。

‘Thank you,’ she said, and she shut the door of her room. The woman went away mortified. Not a word, not a tear—ha! Gudrun was cold, a cold woman.
“谢谢你，”她说，然后关上了房间的门。女人羞愧地走了。没有一句话，没有一滴眼泪——哈！古珍很冷酷，一个冷酷的女人。

Gudrun sat on in her room, her face pale and impassive. What was she to do? She could not weep and make a scene. She could not alter herself. She sat motionless, hiding from people. Her one motive was to avoid actual contact with events. She only wrote out a long telegram to Ursula and Birkin.
古珍坐在她的房间里，脸色苍白，面无表情。她该怎么办？她不能哭泣，不能大吵大闹。她无法改变自己。她一动不动地坐着，躲避着人们。她的动机之一是避免与事件发生实际接触。她只给乌苏拉和伯金写了一封很长的电报。

In the afternoon, however, she rose suddenly to look for Loerke. She glanced with apprehension at the door of the room that had been Gerald’s. Not for worlds would she enter there.
然而到了下午，她突然起身去找洛克。她忧心忡忡地看了一眼杰拉尔德房间的门。她绝对不会进入那里。

She found Loerke sitting alone in the lounge. She went straight up to him.
她发现洛克独自坐在休息室里。她径直走向他。

‘It isn’t true, is it?’ she said.
“这不是真的，是吗？”她说。

He looked up at her. A small smile of misery twisted his face. He shrugged his shoulders.
他抬头看着她。他的脸上露出一丝痛苦的微笑。他耸耸肩。

‘True?’ he echoed.
“是吗？”他重复道。

‘We haven’t killed him?’ she asked.
“我们没有杀了他？”她问道。

He disliked her coming to him in such a manner. He raised his shoulders wearily.
他不喜欢她以这样的方式来找他。他疲倦地抬起肩膀。

‘It has happened,’ he said.
“事情已经发生了，”他说。

She looked at him. He sat crushed and frustrated for the time being, quite as emotionless and barren as herself. My God! this was a barren tragedy, barren, barren.
她看着他。他暂时坐在那里，心情沮丧、沮丧，就像她一样冷漠、贫瘠。我的上帝！这是一场贫瘠的悲剧，贫瘠，贫瘠。

She returned to her room to wait for Ursula and Birkin. She wanted to get away, only to get away. She could not think or feel until she had got away, till she was loosed from this position.
她回到自己的房间等待乌苏拉和伯金。她想逃，只是为了逃。她无法思考或感觉，直到她离开，直到她摆脱这个姿势。

The day passed, the next day came. She heard the sledge, saw Ursula and Birkin alight, and she shrank from these also.
一天过去了，第二天到来了。她听到了雪橇的声音，看到乌苏拉和伯金下了车，她也从这些人面前退缩了。

Ursula came straight up to her.
乌苏拉径直走到她面前。

‘Gudrun!’ she cried, the tears running down her cheeks. And she took her sister in her arms. Gudrun hid her face on Ursula’s shoulder, but still she could not escape the cold devil of irony that froze her soul.
“古德伦！”她喊道，泪水顺着脸颊流下来。她把妹妹抱在怀里。古德伦把脸埋在乌苏拉的肩膀上，但她仍然无法逃脱那冰冷的讽刺魔鬼，冻结了她的灵魂。

‘Ha, ha!’ she thought, ‘this is the right behaviour.’
“哈哈哈！”她想，“这是正确的行为。”

But she could not weep, and the sight of her cold, pale, impassive face soon stopped the fountain of Ursula’s tears. In a few moments, the sisters had nothing to say to each other.
但她哭不出来，看到她冰冷、苍白、冷漠的脸，乌苏拉的泪水很快就止住了。一时间，姐妹俩都无话可说了。

‘Was it very vile to be dragged back here again?’ Gudrun asked at length.
“再次被拖回这里是不是很卑鄙？”古德伦最后问道。

Ursula looked up in some bewilderment.
乌苏拉有些困惑地抬起头。

‘I never thought of it,’ she said.
“我从来没有想过，”她说。

‘I felt a beast, fetching you,’ said Gudrun. ‘But I simply couldn’t see people. That is too much for me.’
“我感觉有一只野兽在抓你，”古德伦说。 “但我就是看不到人。这对我来说太过分了。

‘Yes,’ said Ursula, chilled.
“是的，”乌苏拉冷冷地说。

Birkin tapped and entered. His face was white and expressionless. She knew he knew. He gave her his hand, saying:
伯金敲了敲门就进去了。他脸色惨白，毫无表情。她知道他知道。他向她伸出手，说道：

‘The end of THIS trip, at any rate.’
“无论如何，这次旅行结束了。”

Gudrun glanced at him, afraid.
古德伦惊恐地看着他。

There was silence between the three of them, nothing to be said. At length Ursula asked in a small voice:
三人之间一片沉默，没有什么话可说。最后乌苏拉小声问道：

‘Have you seen him?’
'你看见他了吗？'

He looked back at Ursula with a hard, cold look, and did not trouble to answer.
他回头看了乌苏拉一眼，眼神冷酷而严厉，懒得回答。

‘Have you seen him?’ she repeated.
“你见过他吗？”她重复道。

‘I have,’ he said, coldly.
“我有，”他冷冷地说。

Then he looked at Gudrun.
然后他看着古德伦。

‘Have you done anything?’ he said.
“你做了什么吗？”他说。

‘Nothing,’ she replied, ‘nothing.’
“没什么，”她回答，“没什么。”

She shrank in cold disgust from making any statement.
她因冰冷的厌恶而畏缩着，不敢发表任何言论。

‘Loerke says that Gerald came to you, when you were sitting on the sledge at the bottom of the Rudelbahn, that you had words, and Gerald walked away. What were the words about? I had better know, so that I can satisfy the authorities, if necessary.’
“洛克说，当你坐在鲁德尔巴恩底部的雪橇上时，杰拉尔德来找你，你说了些什么，然后杰拉尔德走开了。这些话是关于什么的？我最好知道，这样我才能在必要时满足当局的要求。”

Gudrun looked up at him, white, childlike, mute with trouble.
古德伦抬头看着他，脸色苍白，孩子气，因为烦恼而沉默。

‘There weren’t even any words,’ she said. ‘He knocked Loerke down and stunned him, he half strangled me, then he went away.’
“甚至没有任何言语，”她说。 “他把洛克打倒并打昏了他，他把我勒死了一半，然后就走了。”

To herself she was saying:
她对自己说：

‘A pretty little sample of the eternal triangle!’ And she turned ironically away, because she knew that the fight had been between Gerald and herself and that the presence of the third party was a mere contingency—an inevitable contingency perhaps, but a contingency none the less. But let them have it as an example of the eternal triangle, the trinity of hate. It would be simpler for them.
“永恒三角的一个相当小的样本！”她讽刺地转过身去，因为她知道这场战斗是杰拉尔德和她自己之间的战斗，而第三方的出现只是一个偶然事件——也许是一个不可避免的偶然事件，但也是一个偶然事件尽管如此。但让他们把它作为永恒三角、仇恨三位一体的例子。对他们来说会更简单。

Birkin went away, his manner cold and abstracted. But she knew he would do things for her, nevertheless, he would see her through. She smiled slightly to herself, with contempt. Let him do the work, since he was so extremely GOOD at looking after other people.
伯金走开了，他的态度冷漠而心不在焉。但她知道他会为她做事，尽管如此，他也会陪她度过难关。她轻蔑地对自己微笑。让他来做这个工作吧，因为他非常擅长照顾别人。

Birkin went again to Gerald. He had loved him. And yet he felt chiefly disgust at the inert body lying there. It was so inert, so coldly dead, a carcase, Birkin’s bowels seemed to turn to ice. He had to stand and look at the frozen dead body that had been Gerald.
伯金再次去找杰拉德。他曾经爱过他。但他主要对躺在那里的一具毫无生气的尸体感到厌恶。它是如此的惰性，如此冰冷的死亡，一具尸体，伯金的肠子似乎变成了冰。他不得不站起来，看着杰拉德那具冰冻的尸体。

It was the frozen carcase of a dead male. Birkin remembered a rabbit which he had once found frozen like a board on the snow. It had been rigid like a dried board when he picked it up. And now this was Gerald, stiff as a board, curled up as if for sleep, yet with the horrible hardness somehow evident. It filled him with horror. The room must be made warm, the body must be thawed. The limbs would break like glass or like wood if they had to be straightened.
那是一头男性死者的冰冻尸体。伯金记得有一次他发现一只兔子被冻得像雪地上的木板一样。当他拿起它时，它已经像一块干燥的木板一样坚硬。现在这就是杰拉尔德，僵硬得像一块木板，蜷缩着，好像要睡觉，但不知何故，却带着可怕的僵硬。这让他充满了恐惧。房间必须变暖，尸体必须解冻。如果必须伸直四肢，它们就会像玻璃或木头一样折断。

He reached and touched the dead face. And the sharp, heavy bruise of ice bruised his living bowels. He wondered if he himself were freezing too, freezing from the inside. In the short blond moustache the life-breath was frozen into a block of ice, beneath the silent nostrils. And this was Gerald!
他伸手触摸那张死人的脸。尖锐而沉重的冰伤伤及了他活生生的肠子。他想知道他自己是不是也冻僵了，从里面冻僵了。在金色的短胡子里，生命的气息在沉默的鼻孔下面冻结成一块冰。这就是杰拉尔德！

Again he touched the sharp, almost glittering fair hair of the frozen body. It was icy-cold, hair icy-cold, almost venomous. Birkin’s heart began to freeze. He had loved Gerald. Now he looked at the shapely, strange-coloured face, with the small, fine, pinched nose and the manly cheeks, saw it frozen like an ice-pebble—yet he had loved it. What was one to think or feel? His brain was beginning to freeze, his blood was turning to ice-water. So cold, so cold, a heavy, bruising cold pressing on his arms from outside, and a heavier cold congealing within him, in his heart and in his bowels.
他再次触碰了冰冻尸体上锋利的、几乎闪闪发光的金发。冰冷，头发冰冷，几乎有毒。伯金的心开始冰冷。他曾经爱过杰拉德。现在，他看着那张形状匀称、颜色奇特的脸，还有那小而精致、紧缩的鼻子和充满男子气概的脸颊，看到它像一块冰石一样冻结——但他很喜欢它。人们的想法或感受是什么？他的大脑开始冻结，他的血液变成了冰水。好冷，好冷，一股重重的冷气从外面压在他的手臂上，更重的冷气凝结在他的内心、他的心、他的肠子里。

He went over the snow slopes, to see where the death had been. At last he came to the great shallow among the precipices and slopes, near the summit of the pass. It was a grey day, the third day of greyness and stillness. All was white, icy, pallid, save for the scoring of black rocks that jutted like roots sometimes, and sometimes were in naked faces. In the distance a slope sheered down from a peak, with many black rock-slides.
他翻过雪坡，去看看死亡地点。最后，他来到了悬崖和斜坡之间的大浅滩，靠近山口的山顶。这是一个灰暗的日子，灰暗而寂静的第三天。一切都是白色的，冰冷的，苍白的，除了黑色岩石的刻痕，有时像树根一样突出，有时是裸露的面孔。远处有一个斜坡从山顶陡然下降，上面有许多黑色的岩石滑坡。

It was like a shallow pot lying among the stone and snow of the upper world. In this pot Gerald had gone to sleep. At the far end, the guides had driven iron stakes deep into the snow-wall, so that, by means of the great rope attached, they could haul themselves up the massive snow-front, out on to the jagged summit of the pass, naked to heaven, where the Marienhutte hid among the naked rocks. Round about, spiked, slashed snow-peaks pricked the heaven.
它就像一个浅锅，躺在上层世界的石头和雪中。杰拉尔德在这个罐子里睡着了。在远端，向导们把铁桩深深地打入雪墙，这样，通过系着的大绳子，他们就可以把自己拖上巨大的雪前，到达山口锯齿状的山顶，赤裸裸的天堂，玛丽恩小屋隐藏在裸露的岩石中。周围，​​尖刺的雪峰刺破了天空。

Gerald might have found this rope. He might have hauled himself up to the crest. He might have heard the dogs in the Marienhutte, and found shelter. He might have gone on, down the steep, steep fall of the south-side, down into the dark valley with its pines, on to the great Imperial road leading south to Italy.
杰拉德可能已经找到了这条绳子。他可能已经把自己拉到了山顶。他可能听到了玛丽恩小屋里的狗叫声，并找到了庇护所。他可能会继续走下去，沿着南边陡峭的陡坡，进入长满松树的黑暗山谷，走上通往南方意大利的伟大帝国道路。

He might! And what then? The Imperial road! The south? Italy? What then? Was it a way out? It was only a way in again. Birkin stood high in the painful air, looking at the peaks, and the way south. Was it any good going south, to Italy? Down the old, old Imperial road?
他可能会！然后呢？帝道！南方？意大利？然后怎样呢？这是一条出路吗？这只是再次进入的一条路。伯金高高地站在痛苦的空气中，看着山峰，看着南方的路。向南去意大利有好处吗？沿着古老的帝国道路？

He turned away. Either the heart would break, or cease to care. Best cease to care. Whatever the mystery which has brought forth man and the universe, it is a non-human mystery, it has its own great ends, man is not the criterion. Best leave it all to the vast, creative, non-human mystery. Best strive with oneself only, not with the universe.
他转身走开。要么心碎，要么不再关心。最好不再关心。无论产生人类和宇宙的奥秘是什么，它都是非人类的奥秘，它有它自己的伟大目的，人不是标准。最好把这一切都留给巨大的、创造性的、非人类的神秘。最好只与自己奋斗，而不是与宇宙奋斗。

‘God cannot do without man.’ It was a saying of some great French religious teacher. But surely this is false. God can do without man. God could do without the ichthyosauri and the mastodon. These monsters failed creatively to develop, so God, the creative mystery, dispensed with them. In the same way the mystery could dispense with man, should he too fail creatively to change and develop. The eternal creative mystery could dispose of man, and replace him with a finer created being. Just as the horse has taken the place of the mastodon.
“上帝离不开人。”这是法国一位伟大宗教导师的名言。但这肯定是错误的。神可以不需要人。上帝可以没有鱼龙和乳齿象。这些怪物未能创造性地发展，因此上帝，创造性的奥秘，放弃了它们。同样，如果人也无法创造性地改变和发展，神秘就可以消失。永恒的创造之谜可以消灭人类，并用更优秀的创造物取代他。正如马取代了乳齿象一样。

It was very consoling to Birkin, to think this. If humanity ran into a CUL DE SAC and expended itself, the timeless creative mystery would bring forth some other being, finer, more wonderful, some new, more lovely race, to carry on the embodiment of creation. The game was never up. The mystery of creation was fathomless, infallible, inexhaustible, forever. Races came and went, species passed away, but ever new species arose, more lovely, or equally lovely, always surpassing wonder. The fountain-head was incorruptible and unsearchable. It had no limits. It could bring forth miracles, create utter new races and new species, in its own hour, new forms of consciousness, new forms of body, new units of being. To be man was as nothing compared to the possibilities of the creative mystery. To have one’s pulse beating direct from the mystery, this was perfection, unutterable satisfaction. Human or inhuman mattered nothing. The perfect pulse throbbed with indescribable being, miraculous unborn species.
想到这一点，伯金感到非常安慰。如果人类遇到了一条死胡同并消耗了自己，那么永恒的创造之谜就会带来一些其他的存在，更美好，更美妙，一些新的，更可爱的种族，来继续创造的体现。比赛一直没有结束。创造的奥秘是深不可测、绝对可靠、取之不尽、用之不竭、永远的。种族来了又去，物种消亡，但新的物种不断出现，更可爱，或者同样可爱，总是超越奇迹。源头是不朽的、不可探索的。它没有限制。它可以创造奇迹，创造全新的种族和新物种，在它自己的时代，新的意识形式，新的身体形式，新的存在单位。与创造之谜的可能性相比，成为人简直微不足道。脉搏直接从神秘中跳动，这是完美的，是难以言喻的满足。人性或非人性并不重要。完美的脉搏伴随着难以形容的存在、神奇的未出生物种而跳动。

Birkin went home again to Gerald. He went into the room, and sat down on the bed. Dead, dead and cold!
伯金再次回到杰拉尔德身边。他走进房间，在床上坐下。死了，死了，冷了！

Imperial Caesar dead, and turned to clay
凯撒帝国死后变成了泥土

Would stop a hole to keep the wind away.
会堵一个洞来挡风。

There was no response from that which had been Gerald. Strange, congealed, icy substance—no more. No more!
杰拉德没有做出任何回应。奇怪的、凝结的、冰冷的物质——仅此而已。不再！

Terribly weary, Birkin went away, about the day’s business. He did it all quietly, without bother. To rant, to rave, to be tragic, to make situations—it was all too late. Best be quiet, and bear one’s soul in patience and in fullness.
伯金实在太累了，就离开了，去忙今天的事。这一切都是他默默地做的，没有任何打扰。咆哮、狂欢、悲惨、制造情境——一切都太晚了。最好保持安静，耐心、充实地承受自己的灵魂。

But when he went in again, at evening, to look at Gerald between the candles, because of his heart’s hunger, suddenly his heart contracted, his own candle all but fell from his hand, as, with a strange whimpering cry, the tears broke out. He sat down in a chair, shaken by a sudden access. Ursula who had followed him, recoiled aghast from him, as he sat with sunken head and body convulsively shaken, making a strange, horrible sound of tears.
但是，当他晚上再次进去，在蜡烛之间看着杰拉尔德时，由于他内心的饥饿，他的心突然收缩，他自己的蜡烛几乎从他手里掉下来，随着一声奇怪的呜咽，眼泪夺眶而出。出去。他坐在椅子上，被突然的闯入吓得浑身发抖。跟着他的乌苏拉惊恐地从他身边退开，而他低着头坐着，身体痉挛性地摇晃，发出一种奇怪的、可怕的泪水声。

‘I didn’t want it to be like this—I didn’t want it to be like this,’ he cried to himself. Ursula could but think of the Kaiser’s: ‘Ich habe as nicht gewollt.’ She looked almost with horror on Birkin.
“我不希望事情变成这样——我不想事情变成这样，”他对自己喊道。乌苏拉只能想起德皇的话：“Ich habe as nicht gewollt。”她几乎惊恐地看着柏金包。

Suddenly he was silent. But he sat with his head dropped, to hide his face. Then furtively he wiped his face with his fingers. Then suddenly he lifted his head, and looked straight at Ursula, with dark, almost vengeful eyes.
突然他沉默了。但他低着头坐着，以遮住脸。然后偷偷地用手指擦了擦脸。然后他突然抬起头，直视着乌苏拉，一双漆黑的眼睛几乎充满了复仇的目光。

‘He should have loved me,’ he said. ‘I offered him.’
“他应该爱我，”他说。 “我向他提出了请求。”

She, afraid, white, with mute lips answered:
她面色苍白，面色恐惧，嘴唇哑然，回答道：

‘What difference would it have made!’
“那会有什么不同呢！”

‘It would!’ he said. ‘It would.’
“会的！”他说。 '它会。'

He forgot her, and turned to look at Gerald. With head oddly lifted, like a man who draws his head back from an insult, half haughtily, he watched the cold, mute, material face. It had a bluish cast. It sent a shaft like ice through the heart of the living man. Cold, mute, material! Birkin remembered how once Gerald had clutched his hand, with a warm, momentaneous grip of final love. For one second—then let go again, let go for ever. If he had kept true to that clasp, death would not have mattered. Those who die, and dying still can love, still believe, do not die. They live still in the beloved. Gerald might still have been living in the spirit with Birkin, even after death. He might have lived with his friend, a further life.
他忘记了她，转身看着杰拉德。他奇怪地抬起头，就像一个因受到侮辱而低下头的人，半傲慢地看着那张冰冷、沉默、物质的脸。它有蓝色的色调。它像冰一样的箭穿过了活人的心脏。冷，静音，物质！伯金记得杰拉德曾经握着他的手，那是一种温暖、瞬间的爱意。一秒钟——然后再次放手，永远放手。如果他忠于这一点，死亡就不再重要了。那些死了的人，死了仍然可以爱，仍然相信，不死。他们仍然生活在所爱的人之中。即使在死后，杰拉尔德的精神可能仍与伯金一起生活。他可能会和他的朋友一起生活，过一种更美好的生活。

But now he was dead, like clay, like bluish, corruptible ice. Birkin looked at the pale fingers, the inert mass. He remembered a dead stallion he had seen: a dead mass of maleness, repugnant. He remembered also the beautiful face of one whom he had loved, and who had died still having the faith to yield to the mystery. That dead face was beautiful, no one could call it cold, mute, material. No one could remember it without gaining faith in the mystery, without the soul’s warming with new, deep life-trust.
但现在他死了，就像粘土，就像蓝色的、易腐烂的冰。伯金看着苍白的手指，一团毫无生气的东西。他想起了他见过的一匹死去的种马：一具死去的雄性，令人厌恶。他还记得他所爱的人的美丽面孔，他死后仍然有信仰屈服于这个谜团。那张死人的脸很美，没有人能称之为冰冷、沉默、物质。如果没有对这个奥秘产生信心，没有灵魂因新的、深刻的生命信任而温暖，就没有人能记住它。

And Gerald! The denier! He left the heart cold, frozen, hardly able to beat. Gerald’s father had looked wistful, to break the heart: but not this last terrible look of cold, mute Matter. Birkin watched and watched.
还有杰拉尔德！否认者！他的心冰冷、冰冻、几乎无法跳动。杰拉尔德的父亲看上去充满渴望，令人心碎：但不是最后那冷漠、沉默的可怕表情。伯金看着又看着。

Ursula stood aside watching the living man stare at the frozen face of the dead man. Both faces were unmoved and unmoving. The candle-flames flickered in the frozen air, in the intense silence.
乌苏拉站在一旁，看着活人盯着死者冰冷的脸。两张脸都不动，一动不动。蜡烛的火焰在冰冷的空气中闪烁，在极度的寂静中。

‘Haven’t you seen enough?’ she said.
“你还没看够吗？”她说。

He got up.
他起来了。

‘It’s a bitter thing to me,’ he said.
“这对我来说是一件痛苦的事情，”他说。

‘What—that he’s dead?’ she said.
“什么——他死了？”她说。

His eyes just met hers. He did not answer.
他的目光刚好与她的目光相遇。他没有回答。

‘You’ve got me,’ she said.
“你有我，”她说。

He smiled and kissed her.
他微笑着吻了她。

‘If I die,’ he said, ‘you’ll know I haven’t left you.’
“如果我死了，”他说，“你就会知道我没有离开你。”

‘And me?’ she cried.
“那我呢？”她喊道。

‘And you won’t have left me,’ he said. ‘We shan’t have any need to despair, in death.’
“你不会离开我的，”他说。 “我们没有必要对死亡感到绝望。”

She took hold of his hand.
她握住他的手。

‘But need you despair over Gerald?’ she said.
“但是你需要对杰拉德感到绝望吗？”她说。

‘Yes,’ he answered.
“是的，”我回答道。

They went away. Gerald was taken to England, to be buried. Birkin and Ursula accompanied the body, along with one of Gerald’s brothers. It was the Crich brothers and sisters who insisted on the burial in England. Birkin wanted to leave the dead man in the Alps, near the snow. But the family was strident, loudly insistent.
他们走了。杰拉尔德被带到英国埋葬。伯金和乌苏拉以及杰拉德的一位兄弟陪伴着尸体。正是克里奇兄弟姐妹坚持要求葬在英国。伯金想把死者留在阿尔卑斯山的雪地附近。但家人态度强硬，坚决要求。

Gudrun went to Dresden. She wrote no particulars of herself. Ursula stayed at the Mill with Birkin for a week or two. They were both very quiet.
古德伦去了德累斯顿。她没有写下自己的详细信息。乌苏拉和伯金在磨坊待了一两个星期。他们都很安静。

‘Did you need Gerald?’ she asked one evening.
“你需要杰拉德吗？”一天晚上她问道。

‘Yes,’ he said.
“是的，”他说。

‘Aren’t I enough for you?’ she asked.
“我对你来说还不够吗？”她问。

‘No,’ he said. ‘You are enough for me, as far as a woman is concerned. You are all women to me. But I wanted a man friend, as eternal as you and I are eternal.’
“不，”他说。 ‘对于一个女人来说，你对我来说就足够了。你们对我来说都是女人。但我想要一个男性朋友，就像你和我一样永恒。

‘Why aren’t I enough?’ she said. ‘You are enough for me. I don’t want anybody else but you. Why isn’t it the same with you?’
“为什么我还不够？”她说。 ‘你对我来说就足够了。除了你我谁都不想要。为什么你的情况不一样呢？

‘Having you, I can live all my life without anybody else, any other sheer intimacy. But to make it complete, really happy, I wanted eternal union with a man too: another kind of love,’ he said.
‘有了你，我就可以度过一生，不需要任何其他人，任何其他纯粹的亲密关系。但为了让一切变得完整、真正幸福，我也想与一个男人永远结合：另一种爱，”他说。

‘I don’t believe it,’ she said. ‘It’s an obstinacy, a theory, a perversity.’
“我不相信，”她说。 “这是一种固执、一种理论、一种反常。”

‘Well—‘ he said.
“嗯——”他说。

‘You can’t have two kinds of love. Why should you!’
‘你不能有两种爱。你为什么要！'

It seems as if I can’t,’ he said. ‘Yet I wanted it.’
看来我不能，”他说。 “但我想要它。”

‘You can’t have it, because it’s false, impossible,’ she said.
“你不能拥有它，因为它是假的，不可能的，”她说。

‘I don’t believe that,’ he answered.
“我不相信，”他回答道。
