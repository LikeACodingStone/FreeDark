Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:
身材魁梧、肥胖的巴克·穆里根从楼梯口走来，手里端着一碗泡沫，上面交叉放着一面镜子和一把剃须刀。一件没有束带的黄色晨衣在清晨温和的空气中被轻轻地拖在身后。他高举碗，吟诵道：

—Introibo ad altare Dei.
——Introibo ad altare Dei。

Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
他停了下来，向下凝视着黑暗蜿蜒的楼梯，粗声粗气地喊道：

—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
——上来，金奇！起来吧，你这个可怕的耶稣会士！

Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.
他庄严地走上前，登上圆形枪架。他转过身来，严肃地祝福了塔楼、周围的土地和苏醒的山脉三次。然后，他看到了斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯，弯下腰，在空中快速划过，喉咙里咕噜咕噜地叫着，摇着头。史蒂芬·迪达勒斯不悦又困倦，双臂靠在楼梯顶上，冷冷地看着那张祝福着他、颤抖着、咯咯笑的脸，脸长得像马，还有一头浅色的、未经理发的头发，纹理和色调像苍白的橡木。

Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.
巴克·穆里根在镜子下看了一眼，然后巧妙地盖上了碗。

—Back to barracks! he said sternly.
——回军营！他严肃地说。

He added in a preacher’s tone:
他用传教士的语气补充道：

—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.
——亲爱的，这就是真正的克里斯汀：身体、灵魂、血脉和恩。请放慢音乐。闭上眼睛，先生们。一会儿。那些白细胞有点麻烦。全体沉默。

He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.
他侧身凝视，缓慢地发出一声长长的口哨声，然后全神贯注地停顿了一会儿，他那整齐洁白的牙齿到处都闪烁着金色的光芒。金口。平静中传来两声尖锐的尖锐哨声。

—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?
——谢谢你，老伙计，他大声喊道。这样就很好了。关掉电流，好吗？

He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
他跳下枪托，严肃地看着他的观察者，把长袍松散的褶皱收拢在腿上。肥胖的阴影脸和阴沉的椭圆形下巴让人想起中世纪的一位高级艺术赞助人。他的唇边静静地绽放着愉快的微笑。

—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
——真是讽刺啊！他高兴地说。你可笑的名字，一个古希腊人！

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.
他友善地用手指着手指，走到栏杆边，自顾自地笑起来。史蒂芬·迪达勒斯走上前去，疲倦地跟着他走了一半，然后坐在枪托边缘，一动不动地看着他把镜子撑在栏杆上，用刷子在碗里蘸了蘸，在脸颊和脖子上抹了肥皂泡。

Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.
巴克·穆里根欢快的声音继续说道。

—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?
——我的名字也很荒谬：Malachi Mulligan，两个短指。但它有一个希腊戒指，不是吗？像雄鹿一样绊倒，阳光明媚。我们必须去雅典。如果我能让阿姨掏出二十英镑你就来吗？

He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
他把画笔放在一边，高兴地大笑着喊道：

—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!
——他会来吗？空肠耶稣会士！

Ceasing, he began to shave with care.
他停下来，开始小心翼翼地刮胡子。

—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.
——告诉我，穆里根，斯蒂芬轻声说道。

—Yes, my love?
-是的亲爱的？

—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
——海恩斯要在这座塔里待多久？

Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.
巴克·穆里根的右肩上露出了剃光的脸颊。

—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.
——天啊，他不是很可怕吗？他坦白地说。一个笨重的撒克逊人。他认为你不是一个绅士。天哪，这些该死的英国人！钱多了又消化不良。因为他来自牛津。你知道，迪达勒斯，你有真正的牛津风格。他看不出你的样子。哦，我给你起的名字是最好的：金奇，刀刃。

He shaved warily over his chin.
他小心翼翼地刮着下巴上的胡子。

—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is his guncase?
——史蒂芬说，他整个晚上都在胡言乱语地谈论一只黑豹。他的枪箱在哪里？

—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?
——一个可恶的疯子！马里根说。你当时感到害怕吗？

—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If he stays on here I am off.
——我是，史蒂芬充满活力地说，但同时也越来越害怕。在黑暗中，和一个我不认识的人在一起，为射杀一只黑豹而胡言乱语、呻吟着。你救了溺水的人。然而，我不是英雄。如果他留在这里我就走了。

Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
巴克·穆里根对剃须刀片上的泡沫皱起了眉头。他从座位上跳下来，开始匆忙地搜查裤兜。

—Scutter! he cried thickly.
——斯卡特！他大声喊道。

He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said:
他走到枪架前，把手伸进斯蒂芬上衣口袋，说道：

—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.
——借你的鼻抹布给我们来擦我的剃须刀。

Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
斯蒂芬让他拉出一块脏兮兮、皱巴巴的手帕，并在手帕的一角举起。巴克·穆里根把剃须刀片擦拭得干干净净。然后，他凝视着手帕，说道：

—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can’t you?
——吟游诗人的鼻抹布！爱尔兰诗人的新艺术色彩：鼻涕绿。你几乎可以尝到它的味道，不是吗？

He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.
他再次登上栏杆，凝视着都柏林海湾，浅橡木色的头发微微颤动。

—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.
-上帝！他轻声说道。大海不就是阿尔吉所说的：伟大而甜蜜的母亲吗？鼻涕绿的海。阴囊紧缩海。 Epi奥伊诺帕浮桥。啊，代达勒斯，希腊人！我必须教你。您必须阅读原文。塔拉塔！塔拉塔！她是我们伟大可爱的母亲。过来看看。

Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.
斯蒂芬站起来，走到栏杆边。他靠在上面俯视着水面和驶过金斯敦港口的邮船。

—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.
——我们伟大的母亲！巴克·穆里根说道。

He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face.
他突然把灰色的目光从大海转向斯蒂芬的脸。

—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you.
——阿姨认为你杀了你的母亲，他说。这就是为什么她不让我和你有任何关系。

—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.
——有人杀了她，史蒂芬阴郁地说。

—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you …
——当你垂死的母亲问你时，你本可以跪下来，该死的，金奇，巴克·马里根说。我和你一样都是北方人。但想想你的母亲用最后一口气恳求你跪下来为她祈祷。而你拒绝了。你身上有某种不祥的东西……

He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smile curled his lips.
他停下来，再次在另一边脸颊上轻轻抹上肥皂泡。他的嘴角扬起一抹宽容的微笑。

—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all!
——但是一个可爱的小丑！他自言自语道。金奇，他们中最可爱的小丑！

He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.
他刮得均匀、小心、安静、认真。

Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
斯蒂芬的手肘搁在锯齿状的花岗岩上，手掌靠在额头上，凝视着闪亮的黑色衣袖磨损的边缘。痛苦，那还不是爱情的痛苦，让他心烦意乱。死后，她在梦中静静地来到他身边，她那枯萎的身体裹在松散的棕色墓衣里，散发出蜡和红木的气味，她的呼吸，向他倾诉，无声，带着责备，带着微弱的湿灰烬的气味。 。透过破旧的袖口，他看到大海被他身边饱含营养的声音欢呼为一位伟大而甜蜜的母亲。海湾和天际线的环圈里有一团暗绿色的液体。她临终前的床边放着一碗白色瓷器，里面盛着绿色的、迟缓的胆汁，这些胆汁是她因一阵阵大声呻吟呕吐而从腐烂的肝脏中撕下来的。

Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.
巴克·穆里根再次擦拭他的剃须刀片。

—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?
——啊，可怜的狗！他用和善的声音说道。我必须给你一件衬衫和几块鼻布。二手房怎么样？

—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.
——它们很合身，史蒂芬回答道。

Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.
巴克·穆里根攻击下唇下方的凹陷处。

—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You look damn well when you’re dressed.
——真是讽刺，他心满意足地说。第二回合他们应该是。天知道波克西·鲍西给他们留下了什么。我有一双可爱的灰色发带。穿上它们你会看起来很漂亮。我不是在开玩笑，金奇。当你穿好衣服的时候，你看起来非常好。

—Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.
——谢谢，斯蒂芬说。如果它们是灰色的，我就不能穿。

—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers.
——他不能戴它们，巴克·穆里根对着镜子对自己的脸说道。礼仪就是礼仪。他杀了他的母亲，但他不能穿灰色裤子。

He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.
他整齐地叠好剃须刀，用手指抚摸着光滑的皮肤。

Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.
史蒂芬把目光从大海上移开，转向那张有着烟蓝色活动眼睛的胖脸。

—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.p.i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General paralysis of the insane!
——昨晚和我一起在船上的那个家伙，巴克·穆里根说，说你有 g.p.i。他和康诺利·诺曼一起在多蒂维尔。疯子一般瘫痪！

He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.
他把镜子在空中扫了半圈，在海面上闪耀的阳光下将消息闪现出去。他那卷曲的、剃光的嘴唇笑了起来，他洁白的牙齿边缘闪闪发光。笑声占据了他那结实而结实的躯干。

—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
——看看你自己，他说，你这个可怕的吟游诗人！

Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
斯蒂芬向前倾身，凝视着递给他的镜子，镜子上裂开了一条弯曲的裂缝。头发竖起来。正如他和其他人看到的那样。谁给我选了这张脸？这只狗的身体是为了驱除害虫。它也问我。

—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.
——我把它从小偷的房间里偷了出来，巴克·穆里根说。这对她来说没什么问题。姨妈总是为玛拉基留下相貌平平的仆人。不叫他遇见试探。她的名字叫乌苏拉。

Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.
他又大笑起来，把镜子从斯蒂芬凝视的眼睛旁拿开。

—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If Wilde were only alive to see you!
——卡利班因看不到镜子中自己的脸而愤怒，他说。要是王尔德还活着能见到你就好了！

Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
斯蒂芬退后一步，指着他苦涩地说：

—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant.
——它是爱尔兰艺术的象征。仆人的镜子破裂了。

Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.
巴克·穆里根突然挽住了斯蒂芬的手臂，和他一起绕着塔楼走着，他的剃须刀和镜子在他塞进的口袋里发出嘎嘎声。

—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God knows you have more spirit than any of them.
——这样取笑你不公平，金奇，是吗？他和蔼地说。上帝知道你比他们任何人都更有精神。

Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The cold steelpen.
再次格挡。他害怕我的艺术的柳叶刀，就像我害怕他的艺术一样。冰冷的钢笔。

—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.
——仆人的镜子破裂了！把这件事告诉楼下的氧气小伙子，然后向他讨要几尼。他浑身都是钱，认为你不是君子。他的老伙计通过向祖鲁人出售贾拉普或进行一些血腥的诈骗或其他方式来制造他的罐头。天哪，金奇，如果你和我能够共同努力，我们也许可以为这个岛做点什么。将其希腊化。

Cranly’s arm. His arm.
克兰利的手臂。他的胳膊。

—And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one that knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.
——想想你不得不向这些猪乞讨。我是唯一一个知道你是什么的人。你为什么不更信任我一点呢？你对我有什么不满？是海恩斯吗？如果他在这里发出任何声音，我就会打倒西摩，我们会给他比他们对克莱夫·肯普索普更糟糕的蹩脚。

Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!
克莱夫·肯普索普的房间里充满了年轻有钱人的叫喊声。白脸：他们笑着握住肋骨，一根紧握着另一根。哦，我就要死了！轻轻地把这个消息告诉她，奥布里！我会死的！他衬衫上的裂开的丝带在空气中飞扬，他在桌子周围跳来跳去，一瘸一拐地绕着桌子，裤子垂到脚后跟，被玛格达伦的阿德斯拿着裁缝剪刀追赶。一只受惊的小牛脸上涂满了果酱。我不想被拆包！你别跟我玩头晕的牛啊！

Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.
四合院里的夜晚令人震惊，从开着的窗户里传来叫喊声。一位聋哑园丁围着围裙，戴着马修·阿诺德的脸，在阴暗的草坪上推着割草机，仔细地观察着草地上舞动的微粒。

To ourselves … new paganism … omphalos.
对我们自己来说……新的异教……omphalos。

—Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at night.
——让他留下来吧，斯蒂芬说。除了晚上以外，他没有任何问题。

—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m quite frank with you. What have you against me now?
-那这是什么？巴克·穆里根不耐烦地问道。咳咳。我对你很坦诚。你现在跟我有什么仇怨？

They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.
他们停了下来，望向布雷海角的钝海角，它躺在水面上，就像睡鲸的鼻子。斯蒂芬静静地松开了手臂。

—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
——你希望我告诉你吗？他问。

—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.
-是的，这是什么？巴克·穆里根回答道。我什么都不记得了。

He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.
他说话时看着斯蒂芬的脸。一阵微风吹过他的额头，轻轻地吹动着他乱糟糟的金发，在他的眼中激起银色的焦灼。

Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
斯蒂芬对自己的声音感到沮丧，说道：

—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?
——你还记得我母亲去世后我去你家的第一天吗？

Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
巴克·穆里根迅速皱起眉头说道：

—What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?
-什么？在哪里？我什么都不记得了。我只记得想法和感觉。为什么？以上帝的名义发生了什么？

—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.
——你正在泡茶，斯蒂芬说，然后穿过楼梯平台去取更多的热水。你的母亲和一些访客从客厅里出来。她问你谁在你房间里。

—Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.
-是的？巴克·穆里根说道。我说了什么？我忘了。

—You said, Stephen answered, O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead.
——你说，史蒂芬回答说，哦，只有代达勒斯的母亲惨死了。

A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek.
巴克·穆里根的脸颊泛起红晕，让他显得更年轻、更有魅力。

—Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?
——我有这么说过吗？他问。出色地？那有什么害处呢？

He shook his constraint from him nervously.
他紧张地摆脱了束缚。

—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.
——那么什么是死亡，他问道，你母亲的、你的还是我自己的？你只看到你的母亲死去。我每天都看到它们在马特和里士满突然出现，并在解剖室被切成牛肚。这是一件野兽般的事情，仅此而已。这根本不重要。当你母亲临终时请求你时，你不会跪下为她祈祷。为什么？因为你体内有被诅咒的耶稣会菌株，只是注射方式错误而已。对我来说，这完全是一种嘲弄和野兽。她的脑叶不起作用。她给医生彼得·蒂兹尔爵士打电话，并从被子上摘下毛茛。幽默她直到结束。你违背了她死后的最后一个愿望，却又对我生闷气，因为我不像拉卢埃特家雇来的哑巴那样发牢骚。荒诞！我想我确实说过了。我无意冒犯你母亲的记忆。

He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
他已经大胆说出自己的话了。史蒂芬捂住了这句话在他心里留下的伤口，冷冷地说：

—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.
——我不想冒犯我的母亲。

—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.
——那又是什么呢？巴克·穆里根问道。

—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.
——斯蒂芬回答说，这是对我的冒犯。

Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.
巴克·穆里根用脚后跟转过身来。

—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.
——噢，一个不可能的人！他惊呼道。

He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.
他绕着栏杆快步走开。斯蒂芬站在自己的岗位上，凝视着平静的海面，眺望着岬角。大海和岬角现在变得暗淡起来。他的眼睛里有脉搏跳动，遮住了视线，他感到脸颊发热。

A voice within the tower called loudly:
塔内有声音大声呼唤：

—Are you up there, Mulligan?
——穆里根，你在上面吗？

—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.
——我来了，巴克·穆里根回答。

He turned towards Stephen and said:
他转向斯蒂芬说道：

—Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.
——看看大海。它关心什么罪行？查克·洛约拉、金奇，下来吧。萨森纳赫人想要他的早饭。

His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:
他的头在楼梯顶上又停了一会儿，与屋顶齐平：

—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding.
——别整天闷闷不乐，他说。我是无理取闹的。放弃喜怒无常的沉思。

His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:
他的头消失了，但楼梯口却传来他低沉的声音：

And no more turn aside and brood
不再转身沉思

Upon love’s bitter mystery
关于爱情的苦涩奥秘

For Fergus rules the brazen cars.
因为弗格斯统治着厚颜无耻的汽车。

Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.
在早晨的宁静中，木影从他凝视的楼梯口静静地飘过。近岸和更远的地方，水镜变白，被轻快的脚步所驱赶。昏暗大海的白色胸脯。缠绕应力，两两。一只手拨动竖琴弦，将它们缠绕的和弦融合在一起。白色的结婚字样在昏暗的潮汐上闪闪发光。

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.
一片云开始慢慢地、完全地遮住太阳，给海湾投下更深的绿色阴影。他身下躺着一碗苦水。弗格斯的歌：我独自在屋子里唱着这首歌，按住长长的、黑暗的和弦。她的门开着：她想听我的音乐。我带着敬畏和怜悯默默地走到她的床边。她在破烂的床上哭泣。对于这句话，斯蒂芬：爱是苦涩的谜。

Where now?
现在在哪里？

Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:
她的秘密：古老的羽扇、带流苏的舞卡、撒上麝香的粉末、锁着的抽屉里的一串华丽的琥珀珠子。当她还是个女孩的时候，她家阳光明媚的窗户上挂着一个鸟笼。她听到老罗伊斯在哑剧《恐怖的图尔科》中唱歌，当他唱到时，她和其他人一起大笑：

I am the boy
我就是那个男孩

That can enjoy
那可以享受

Invisibility.
隐形。

Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.
梦幻般的欢笑，收起：麝香味。

And no more turn aside and brood.
不再转身沉思。

Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.
和她的玩具一起折叠在大自然的记忆中。回忆困扰着他沉思的大脑。当她走近圣餐时，她从厨房水龙头接了一杯水。在一个漆黑的秋夜，在炉灶上为她烤一个充满红糖的去核苹果。她那漂亮的指甲被孩子们衬衫上压碎的虱子的血染红了。

In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
在梦中，她悄无声息地来到他身边，她那瘦弱的身体裹在宽松的墓衣里，散发着蜡和紫檀木的气味，她的呼吸在他身上低下，发出无声的秘密话语，带着淡淡的湿灰烬的气味。

Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat.
她那双明亮的眼睛，从死亡中凝视着，震撼和弯曲我的灵魂。靠我一个人。点燃她痛苦的鬼烛。饱受折磨的脸上闪烁着幽灵般的光芒。她嘶哑的呼吸声因恐惧而嘎嘎作响，而所有人都跪下祈祷。她的眼睛盯着我，想要击倒我。 Liliata rutilantium teconfesorum turmacircidet：iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat。

Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!
食尸鬼！咀嚼尸体！

No, mother! Let me be and let me live.
不，妈妈！让我存在，让我活下去。

—Kinch ahoy!
——金奇啊嘿！

Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
塔内传来巴克·穆里根的声音。它沿着楼梯走近了，又叫了。斯蒂芬仍然因灵魂的呼喊而颤抖，他听到温暖的阳光和身后空气中友好的话语。

—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.
——代达勒斯，下来吧，像个善良的莫西一样。早餐准备好了。海恩斯为昨晚吵醒我们而道歉。没关系。

—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.
——我来了，斯蒂芬转身说道。

—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our sakes.
——看在耶稣的份上，就这么做吧，巴克·穆里根说。为了我，也为了我们大家。

His head disappeared and reappeared.
他的头消失了又出现了。

—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.
——我告诉他你是爱尔兰艺术的象征。他说这非常聪明。碰他一英镑，好吗？我是说，几尼。

—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.
——我今天早上得到报酬，斯蒂芬说。

—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.
——学校的小鬼？巴克·穆里根说道。多少？四英镑？借给我们一张吧

—If you want it, Stephen said.
——如果你想要的话，斯蒂芬说。

—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.
——四枚闪亮的金币，巴克·穆里根高兴地叫了起来。我们将有一个光荣的醉酒来让德鲁伊德鲁伊们感到惊讶。四位无所不能的君主。

He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:
他举起双手，踏下石阶，带着伦敦口音走调地唱着：

O, won’t we have a merry time,
哦，我们不会有一个快乐的时光吗？

Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
喝威士忌、啤酒和葡萄酒！

On coronation,
加冕礼上，

Coronation day!
加冕日！

O, won’t we have a merry time
哦，我们不会有一个快乐的时光吗

On coronation day!
加冕日！

Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?
温暖的阳光洒满海面。镍制剃须盆闪闪发光，被遗忘在栏杆上。我为什么要把它拿下来？或者整天把它放在那里，忘记了友谊？

He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
他走过去，把它拿在手中一会儿，感受着它的凉爽，闻着刷子粘在泡沫上的粘稠的气味。所以我当时在克朗戈斯抬着香船。我现在是另一个人了，但还是一样。也是一个仆人。仆人的侍者。

In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
在塔楼昏暗的圆顶客厅里，巴克·穆里根穿着长袍的身影在壁炉边轻快地来回走动，时隐时现黄色的光芒。两束柔和的日光从高高的巴巴坎上照射到石板地板上：当它们的光线交汇时，一团煤烟和油炸油脂的烟雾漂浮着，旋转着。

—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?
——我们会窒息的，巴克·穆里根说。海恩斯，打开那扇门，好吗？

Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.
斯蒂芬把剃须盆放在柜子上。一个高大的身影从原来坐的吊床上站起来，走到门口，拉开了内门。

—Have you the key? a voice asked.
——你有钥匙吗？一个声音问道。

—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!
——德达勒斯有，巴克·穆里根说。珍妮·麦克，我窒息了！

He howled, without looking up from the fire:
他头也不回地嚎叫着：

—Kinch!
——金奇！

—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
——它在锁里，史蒂芬走上前说道。

The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.
钥匙刺耳地转动了两下，当厚重的门半开时，迎面而来的光线和明亮的空气进来了。海恩斯站在门口，向外张望。斯蒂芬把他翻倒的手提箱拖到桌子上，坐下来等待。巴克·穆里根把鱼苗扔到他旁边的盘子上。然后他把菜和一个大茶壶端到桌上，重重地放下，松了口气。

—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when … But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.
——我快要融化了，他说，正如蜡烛所说的那样……但是，安静！关于这个话题不再多说！金奇，你醒醒吧！面包、黄油、蜂蜜。海恩斯，进来。幼虫已经准备好了。主啊，请保佑我们，还有这些你的礼物。糖在哪里？噢，杰伊，没有牛奶了。

Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
斯蒂芬从储物柜里取出了面包、一罐蜂蜜和黄油冷却器。巴克·穆里根猛地坐了下来。

—What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.
——这是什么鬼东西？他说。我告诉她八点以后来。

—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the locker.
——我们可以喝黑咖啡，史蒂芬口渴地说。储物柜里有一个柠檬。

—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove milk.
——哦，该死的你和你的巴黎时尚！巴克·穆里根说道。我想要桑迪科夫牛奶。

Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
海恩斯从门口进来，轻声说道：

—That woman is coming up with the milk.
——那个女人正在端牛奶。

—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.
——愿上帝赐福给你！巴克·穆里根哭了，从椅子上跳起来。坐下。把茶倒在那里。糖在袋子里。在这里，我不能去摸索那些该死的鸡蛋。

He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:
他把盘子里的鱼苗切碎，拍到三个盘子上，说道：

—In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
——提名为Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti。

Haines sat down to pour out the tea.
海恩斯坐下来倒茶。

—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?
——我给你们每人两块，他说。但是，我说，穆里根，你确实会泡浓茶，不是吗？

Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:
巴克·马里根一边把面包切成厚片，一边用老妇人哄骗的声音说道：

—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water.
——正如老母亲格罗根所说，当我泡茶时，我就泡茶。当我造水时，我就造水。

—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
——天哪，这是茶，海恩斯说。

Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
巴克·穆里根继续胡言乱语：

—So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma’am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don’t make them in the one pot.
——我就是这么做的，卡希尔夫人，她说。贝戈布，女士，卡希尔夫人说，上帝保佑你不要把它们放在一个锅里。

He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.
他又将一块厚厚的面包刺向他的同伴，刀上刺穿了面包。

—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.
——那是民间的，他非常认真地说，为了你的书，海恩斯。关于邓德拉姆的民间和鱼神的五行文字和十页注释。大风年怪姐妹印的。

He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:
他转向斯蒂芬，扬起眉毛，用一种疑惑的声音问道：

—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?
——兄弟，你还记得吗，《马比诺金》或《奥义书》中提到了母亲格罗根的茶和水壶吗？

—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
——我对此表示怀疑，斯蒂芬严肃地说。

—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?
——现在你知道了吗？巴克·穆里根用同样的语气说道。请问你的理由是什么？

—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
——我想，史蒂芬边吃边说，马比诺金内外都不存在这种东西。据推测，格罗根母亲是玛丽·安的亲戚。

Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.
巴克·穆里根脸上露出喜悦的笑容。

—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!
-迷人！他用一种极其甜美的声音说道，露出洁白的牙齿，愉快地眨着眼睛。你认为她是吗？相当迷人！

Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
然后，他突然用一种沙哑、刺耳的声音咆哮着，同时又用力地切着面包：

—For old Mary Ann
——献给老玛丽·安

 She doesn’t care a damn.
她一点也不在乎。

 But, hising up her petticoats …
但是，掀起她的衬裙……

He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.
他把炸鱼塞满嘴，咀嚼着，发出嗡嗡声。

The doorway was darkened by an entering form.
门口因进来的人影而变暗。

—The milk, sir!
——牛奶，先生！

—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
——请进，女士，穆里根说。金奇，拿壶来。

An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.
一位老妇人走上前来，站在斯蒂芬的肘边。

—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
——这是一个美好的早晨，先生，她说。荣耀归于上帝。

—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
-给谁？马里根看了她一眼说道。啊，当然！

Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.
斯蒂芬向后伸手，从柜子里拿出了奶罐。

—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.
——穆里根漫不经心地对海恩斯说，岛上的居民经常谈论包皮收集者。

—How much, sir? asked the old woman.
——多少钱，先生？老妇人问道。

—A quart, Stephen said.
——一夸脱，斯蒂芬说。

He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
他看着她把牛奶倒进量器里，然后又倒进壶里，那是浓浓的白牛奶，不是她的。老萎缩的爸爸。她又倒了一大杯，又倒了一杯。她是从早晨的世界进入的，古老而神秘，也许是一位信使。她称赞牛奶的品质，把它倒了出来。黎明时分，在郁郁葱葱的田野里，蹲在一头耐心的牛旁边，一个女巫坐在她的毒菌上，她布满皱纹的手指快速地抓着喷出的东西。他们对他们认识的她低声叫喊，她是沾满露水的牛。母牛的丝绸和可怜的老妇人，这些名字都是从前给她起的。一个流浪的老太婆，一个卑微的不朽者，为她的征服者和她的同性恋背叛者服务，他们共同的杜鹃鸟，来自秘密早晨的信使。是去侍奉还是去责备，他自己也说不出来：但不屑于乞求她的恩惠。

—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.
——确实是这样，女士，巴克·穆里根边说边把牛奶倒进他们的杯子里。

—Taste it, sir, she said.
——尝尝吧，先生，她说。

He drank at her bidding.
他按照她的吩咐喝了酒。

—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.
——如果我们能靠这样的美食生活，他有点大声地对她说，我们的国家就不会有烂牙和烂内脏了。生活在沼泽地里，吃着廉价的食物，街道上布满了灰尘、马粪和肺痨患者的口水。

—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
——先生，您是医科学生吗？老妇人问道。

—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.
——我是，女士，巴克·穆里根回答。

—Look at that now, she said.
——现在看看，她说。

Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
斯蒂芬轻蔑地沉默着听着。她低下苍老的头，听从一个大声对她说话的声音，她的接骨师，她的巫医：她轻视我。对于那将枯萎的声音和为坟墓加油的声音，除了她女人不洁的腰部，她的一切，不是按照上帝的形象制造的男人的肉体，蛇的猎物。现在，大声的声音要求她保持沉默，她的眼睛充满了疑惑。

—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
——你明白他说的话吗？史蒂芬问她。

—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
——您说的是法语吗，先生？老妇人对海恩斯说道。

Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
海恩斯再次对她发表了一篇较长的演讲，充满自信。

—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
——爱尔兰语，巴克·穆里根说。你身上有盖尔语吗？

—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the west, sir?
——听上去我以为是爱尔兰语，她说。先生，您是西方人吗？

—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
——我是英国人，海恩斯回答。

—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.
——巴克·穆里根说，他是英国人，他认为我们在爱尔兰应该说爱尔兰语。

—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.
——当然我们应该这样做，老妇人说，我很惭愧我自己不会说这种语言。他们告诉我这是一门伟大的语言。

—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?
——“盛大”并不是它的名字，巴克·穆里根说。完全精彩。金奇，再给我们倒点茶。女士，您想要一杯吗？

—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.
——不，谢谢您，先生，老妇人说着，把奶罐的环套在前臂上，准备走。

Haines said to her:
海恩斯对她说：

—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?
——你有账单吗？我们最好付钱给她，穆里根，不是吗？

Stephen filled again the three cups.
斯蒂芬又给三个杯子倒满了水。

—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
——比尔，先生？她停下来说道。好吧，这七个早上，一品脱两便士等于七两，一先令加两便士，而这三个早晨，一夸脱四便士等于三夸脱一先令。那是一先令，一加二等于二加二，先生。

Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.
巴克·穆里根叹了口气，嘴里塞满了两面都涂了厚厚黄油的面包皮，然后伸出双腿，开始搜查裤兜。

—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
——付钱，看起来愉快，海恩斯微笑着对他说。

Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:
斯蒂芬倒了第三杯，一勺茶给浓稠的牛奶增添了淡淡的色彩。巴克·穆里根拿起一枚弗罗林，在手指上转了一圈，喊道：

—A miracle!
-奇迹！

He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
他把它沿着桌子递给老妇人，说道：

—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
——别再问我了，亲爱的。我能给你的都是我给的。

Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
斯蒂芬把硬币放在她不情愿的手里。

—We’ll owe twopence, he said.
——我们欠两便士，他说。

—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, sir.
——时间够了，先生，她接过硬币说道。时间够了。早上好先生。

She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:
她行屈膝礼走出去，接着是巴克·穆里根温柔的歌声：

—Heart of my heart, were it more,
——我的心，如果更多的话，

 More would be laid at your feet.
更多的东西将会落在你的脚下。

He turned to Stephen and said:
他转向斯蒂芬说：

—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.
——说真的，迪达勒斯。我是铁石心肠。快点去你的学校，给我们带点钱回来。今天，吟游诗人必须饮酒和宴请。爱尔兰希望今天每个人都能履行自己的职责。

—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.
——这提醒了我，海恩斯站起来说，我今天必须去你们的国家图书馆。

—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
——我们先游泳，巴克·穆里根说。

He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
他转向斯蒂芬，温和地问道：

—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
——金奇，今天是你每月洗澡的日子吗？

Then he said to Haines:
然后他对海恩斯说：

—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
——不洁的吟游诗人坚持每月清洗一次。

—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.
——整个爱尔兰都被湾流冲刷过，史蒂芬边说边让蜂蜜滴在一片面包上。

Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
海恩斯在角落里轻松地将围巾系在网球衫宽松的领子上，说道：

—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
——如果你愿意的话，我打算把你的言论收集起来。

Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.
跟我说话。他们清洗、洗澡、擦洗。因威特的阿根比特。良心。但这里有一个地方。

—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.
——那篇关于仆人的破裂镜子是爱尔兰艺术象征的故事被认为是好的。

Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:
巴克·穆里根在桌子底下踢了史蒂芬的脚，语气温暖地说：

—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
——等你听到他在《哈姆雷特》中的表演，海恩斯。

—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
——嗯，我是说真的，海恩斯一边说，一边还在对斯蒂芬说话。我正想着这件事，那个可怜的老东西就进来了。

—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
——我能靠它赚到钱吗？史蒂芬问。

Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:
海恩斯笑了，从吊床的固定器上取下柔软的灰色帽子，说道：

—I don’t know, I’m sure.
——我不知道，但我确定。

He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour:
他蹑手蹑脚地走到门口。巴克·穆里根向斯蒂芬弯下腰，粗暴地说道：

—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
——你现在把蹄子伸进去了。你这么说是为了什么？

—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.
-出色地？斯蒂芬说。问题是要钱。从谁？来自送牛奶的女工或来自他。我认为这是一个折腾。

—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.
——我让他对你大发雷霆，巴克·穆里根说，然后你就带着你那糟糕的斜视和阴郁的耶稣会士嘲笑来了。

—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
——斯蒂芬说，无论是从她还是从他身上，我都看不到什么希望。

Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.
巴克·穆里根悲惨地叹了口气，把手放在斯蒂芬的手臂上。

—From me, Kinch, he said.
——来自我，金奇，他说。

In a suddenly changed tone he added:
他突然改变语气补充道：

—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let us get out of the kip.
——告诉你上帝的真理，我认为你是对的。该死的，他们还有什么用处。你为什么不像我一样玩它们呢？让他们都见鬼去吧。让我们摆脱困境吧。

He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:
他站起来，严肃地解下腰带，脱下长袍，无奈地说：

—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
——穆里根的衣服被脱光了。

He emptied his pockets on to the table.
他把口袋里的东西都掏到了桌子上。

—There’s your snotrag, he said.
——这是你的鼻涕虫，他说。

And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.
他穿上硬领，打上叛逆的领带，对他们说话，斥责他们，还对着他那悬垂的表链。他的双手伸进箱子里翻找，同时要了一块干净的手帕。天啊，我们只需要给这个角色打扮一下就可以了。我想要深褐色手套和绿色靴子。矛盾。我自相矛盾吗？好吧，我自相矛盾。善变的玛拉基。一颗柔软的黑色导弹从他会说话的手中飞出。

—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.
——这是你的拉丁四分之一帽子，他说。

Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the doorway:
斯蒂芬把它捡起来戴上。海恩斯在门口对他们喊道：

—Are you coming, you fellows?
——朋友们，你们来吗？

—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
——我准备好了，巴克·穆里根一边回答一边朝门口走去。出来吧，金奇。我想你已经吃完了我们剩下的一切。他听天由命地昏倒了，语气严肃，步态沉重，几乎带着悲伤地说：

—And going forth he met Butterly.
——走出去时，他遇到了巴特利。

Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
史蒂芬从斜放的地方拿起他的梣木，跟着他们出去，当他们走下梯子时，拉到缓慢的铁门旁并锁上它。他把那把巨大的钥匙放进了他的内袋里。

At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
巴克·穆里根在梯子底下问道：

—Did you bring the key?
——你带钥匙了吗？

—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
——我有，史蒂芬在他们面前说道。

He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
他继续往前走。在他身后，他听见巴克·穆里根用沉重的浴巾击打蕨类植物或草丛的先枝。

—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
——下来，先生！先生你怎么敢！

Haines asked:
海恩斯问道：

—Do you pay rent for this tower?
——这座塔的租金你付吗？

—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
——十二英镑，巴克·穆里根说。

—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
——斯蒂芬回头对战争大臣补充道。

They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
他们停了下来，海恩斯审视着这座塔，最后说道：

—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
——我应该说，冬天相当荒凉。你管它叫马泰洛吗？

—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea. But ours is the omphalos.
——巴克·穆里根说，当法国人在海上时，比利·皮特让他们建造了它们。但我们的是脐。

—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
——你对《哈姆雷特》的看法是怎样的？海恩斯问斯蒂芬。

—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first.
——不，不，巴克·穆里根痛苦地喊道。我无法与托马斯·阿奎那以及他所提出的五十五个理由相提并论。等我先喝几品脱。

He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:
他转向史蒂芬，一边整齐地拉下樱草色背心的山峰，一边说道：

—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
——金奇，你不可能把它控制在三品脱以下，对吗？

—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
——已经等了这么久了，史蒂芬无精打采地说，还可以再等。

—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
——你激起了我的好奇心，海恩斯和蔼地说。是不是有什么悖论？

—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.
-呸！巴克·穆里根说道。我们已经摆脱了王尔德和悖论。这很简单。他用代数证明了哈姆雷特的孙子是莎士比亚的祖父，而他本人就是自己父亲的鬼魂。

—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
-什么？海恩斯说，开始指着斯蒂芬。他自己？

Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
巴克·穆里根把毛巾偷偷地挂在脖子上，弯下腰，轻松地笑起来，对斯蒂芬的耳边说：

—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
——哦，老金奇的影子！雅菲寻找父亲！

—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell.
——我们早上总是很累，斯蒂芬对海恩斯说。而且要说的时间相当长。

Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.
巴克·穆里根再次向前走，举起双手。

—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
——光是神圣的一品脱就能解开迪达勒斯的舌头，他说。

—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o’er his base into the sea, isn’t it?
——我的意思是，海恩斯在他们跟随时向斯蒂芬解释道，这座塔和这里的悬崖不知怎的让我想起了埃尔西诺。甲虫越过他的基地进入大海，不是吗？

Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.
巴克·穆里根突然转过身来。朝斯蒂芬看了一会儿，但没有说话。在明亮、寂静的瞬间，史蒂芬看到了自己的形象，在他们欢快的服装之间，穿着廉价、尘土飞扬的哀悼服。

—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
——这是一个美妙的故事，海恩斯说，让他们再次停下来。

Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.
眼睛像大海一样苍白，被风吹得清新，更加苍白、坚定和谨慎。作为海洋的统治者，他向南眺望海湾，除了明亮的天际线上模糊的邮船的烟羽和穆格林人的帆外，空无一人。

—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.
——我在某处读到过对此的神学解释，他困惑地说。父与子的想法。圣子努力与圣父赎罪。

Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
巴克·穆里根立刻露出了一张愉快的笑容。他看着他们，他那张形状优美的嘴高兴地张开，他那双突然失去了所有精明知觉的眼睛，疯狂地快乐地眨着眼睛。他来回摇晃着一个洋娃娃的头，巴拿马帽的帽檐在颤抖，然后开始用一种安静、快乐、愚蠢的声音吟唱道：

—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
——我是你听过的最奇怪的年轻人。

 My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.
我的母亲是犹太人，我的父亲是鸟。

 With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
我不能同意木匠约瑟夫的观点。

 So here’s to disciples and Calvary.
谨此献给门徒和加略山。

He held up a forefinger of warning.
他举起食指警告。

—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
——如果有人认为我不神圣

 He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
当我酿酒时他不会得到免费饮料

 But have to drink water and wish it were plain
但必须喝水并希望它是普通的

 That i make when the wine becomes water again.
当酒再次变成水时我做的。

He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
他迅速地拉了一下斯蒂芬的梣木，以示告别，然后向前跑到悬崖边，双手在身体两侧挥动，就像即将在空中升起的鱼鳍或翅膀一样，并高喊道：

—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
——再见，现在，再见！写下我所说的一切

 And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
并告诉汤姆、迪克和哈利我从死里复活了。

 What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
骨子里孕育的东西不会让我无法飞翔

 And Olivet’s breezy … Goodbye, now, goodbye!
奥利维特的轻松……再见，现在，再见！

He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
他在他们面前蹦蹦跳跳地朝四十英尺的洞走去，挥舞着翅膀般的双手，敏捷地跳跃着，墨丘利的帽子在劲风中颤动，将他短暂的鸟鸣声传回给他们。

Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:
海恩斯一直小心翼翼地笑着，走到斯蒂芬身边说道：

—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?
——我想我们不应该笑。他相当亵渎。也就是说，我自己不是信徒。但他的快乐还是以某种方式消除了伤害，不是吗？他叫它什么？木匠约瑟夫？

—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
——开玩笑耶稣的歌谣，斯蒂芬回答道。

—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
——哦，海恩斯说，你以前听说过吗？

—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
——一天三次，饭后，史蒂芬冷冷地说。

—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.
——你不是信徒，是吗？海恩斯问道。我的意思是，狭义上的信徒。从无到有的创造、奇迹和人格化的上帝。

—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
——在我看来，这个词只有一种含义，斯蒂芬说。

Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
海恩斯停下来，拿出一个光滑的银盒，里面有一颗闪闪发光的绿色石头。他用拇指把它打开并递给我。

—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
——谢谢你，斯蒂芬说着，抽了一支烟。

Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
海恩斯帮自己把箱子合上。他把它放回侧袋，从背心口袋里掏出一个镍制火绒盒，也把它打开，点燃香烟，用双手将燃烧的火花递给史蒂芬。

—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?
——是的，当然，他说，然后他们又继续往前走。你要么信，要么不信，不是吗？就我个人而言，我无法忍受个人上帝的想法。我想你不支持这一点吧？

—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.
——你瞧，我是一个自由思想的可怕典范，史蒂芬满脸不悦地说。

He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.
他继续往前走，等着别人跟他说话，身边拖着他的梣木。它的套圈轻轻地跟随在路上，在他脚后跟处发出尖叫声。我的魔宠在我身后呼唤，Steeeeeeeeeephen！沿着路径蜿蜒的线。今晚他们将踏上这条路，在黑暗中来到这里。他想要那把钥匙。这是我的。我付了房租。现在我吃他的盐面包。把钥匙也给他。全部。他会要求的。他的眼里就是这样。

—After all, Haines began …
——毕竟，海恩斯开始了……

Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.
史蒂芬转过身，发现打量他的冷漠目光并不全是不友善的。

—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to me.
——毕竟，我认为你应该能够解放自己。在我看来，你就是你自己的主人。

—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.
——我是两个主人的仆人，斯蒂芬说，一个是英国人，一个是意大利人。

—Italian? Haines said.
——意大利语？海恩斯说。

A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.
一位疯狂的女王，年老且善妒。跪在我面前。

—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
——还有第三个，斯蒂芬说，有人想要我做零工。

—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
——意大利语？海恩斯又说道。你是什​​么意思？

—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.
——大英帝国，斯蒂芬回答道，他的脸色升起，还有神圣罗马天主教和使徒教会。

Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.
海恩斯在说话之前从下唇上取下了一些烟草纤维。

—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.
——我很能理解，他平静地说。我敢说，爱尔兰人一定是这样想的。我们在英格兰感到我们对待你们相当不公平。看来历史是罪魁祸首。

The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.
这些骄傲而有力的标题在斯蒂芬的记忆中敲响了铜钟的胜利：et unam sainttam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam：仪式和教条的缓慢增长和变化，就像他自己罕见的思想一样，星星的化学反应。作为教皇马塞勒斯弥撒中使徒们的象征，这些声音混合在一起，独自大声歌唱以示肯定：在他们的圣歌背后，教会激进分子解除了武装并威胁了她的异端分子。一大群异端邪说带着歪歪扭扭的法冠逃跑了：佛提乌斯和穆里根就是其中之一的嘲讽者，还有阿里乌斯，他一生都在为圣子与圣父的同体性而争斗，还有瓦伦丁，蔑视基督的尘世身体，还有狡猾的非洲人异端邪教领袖萨贝利乌斯认为天父就是他自己的儿子。穆里根刚才对这个陌生人说过的嘲讽的话。闲嘲。虚空肯定等待着所有编织风的人：来自教会中那些四面楚歌的天使的威胁、解除武装和攻击，迈克尔的主人，他们在冲突的时刻用长矛和盾牌保卫她。

Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. Zut! Nom de Dieu!
听听，听听！掌声经久不息。祖特！诺姆·德·迪厄！

—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.
——当然，我是英国人，海恩斯的声音说道，我感觉自己就是英国人。我也不想看到我的国家落入德国犹太人手中。恐怕这就是我们的国家问题。

Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
悬崖边上站着两个人看着：商人，船夫。

—She’s making for Bullock harbour.
——她正前往布洛克港。

The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
船家有些不屑的向海湾北边点了点头。

—There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.
——那里有五英寻，他说。当潮水来临时，它就会被那样卷走。今天已经九天了。

The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. Here I am.
那个被淹死的人。一艘帆在空荡荡的海湾里转向，等待着一个肿胀的包裹浮起，在阳光下滚动一张浮肿的脸，盐白色。我在这里。

They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
他们顺着蜿蜒的小路，来到了小溪边。巴克·穆里根穿着衬衫站在一块石头上，松散的领带在肩上飘扬。一个年轻人紧紧抓住附近的一块岩石，绿色的双腿在深水凝胶中缓慢地移动。

—Is the brother with you, Malachi?
——玛拉基，哥哥和你在一起吗？

—Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
——在韦斯特米斯。和班农一家。

—Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
-还在那儿？我收到班农寄来的一张卡片。说他在那里发现了一个可爱的年轻东西。他称她为照片女孩。

—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
——快照，嗯？短暂曝光。

Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.
巴克·穆里根坐下来解开靴子的带子。一位老人在岩石边站了起来，脸涨得通红。他爬上石头，水在他的头顶和灰色头发的花环上闪闪发光，水流过他的胸口和肚子，从他下垂的黑色缠腰布上喷出水流。

Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.
巴克·穆里根给他让路，让他爬过去，看了一眼海恩斯和斯蒂芬，虔诚地用拇指指甲在额头、嘴唇和胸骨上画了十字。

—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
——西摩回到城里了，年轻人说道，再次抓住了他的石刺。扔掉药并参军。

—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
——啊，见上帝吧！巴克·穆里根说道。

—Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
——下周去炖菜。你认识那个红色卡莱尔女孩莉莉吗？

—Yes.
-是的。

—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with money.
——昨晚和他一起在码头上用勺子舀东西。父亲很有钱。

—Is she up the pole?
——她在杆子上吗？

—Better ask Seymour that.
——这个问题最好问问西摩。

—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
——西摩是一个流血的军官！巴克·穆里根说道。

He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:
他一边点点头，一边脱下裤子站了起来，淡淡地说：

—Redheaded women buck like goats.
——红发女人像山羊一样猛冲。

He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
他惊恐地停了下来，摸着自己的侧身在飘动的衬衫下面。

—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the Uebermensch. Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.
——我的第十二根肋骨不见了，他哭道。我是超级人。无牙金奇和我，超人。

He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.
他挣扎着脱下衬衫，把它扔到身后他的衣服所在的地方。

—Are you going in here, Malachi?
——玛拉基，你要进去吗？

—Yes. Make room in the bed.
-是的。在床上腾出空间。

The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.
年轻人向后一推，划过水，干净利落地划了两下，就到达了小溪的中央。海恩斯坐在一块石头上，抽烟。

—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
——你不进来吗？巴克·穆里根问道。

—Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
——后来，海恩斯说道。不在我的早餐上。

Stephen turned away.
史蒂芬转身走开。

—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.
——我走了，穆里根，他说。

—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
——给我们那把钥匙，金奇，巴克·穆里根说，让我的衬衫保持平整。

Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.
斯蒂芬把钥匙递给了他。巴克·穆里根把它放在他堆积如山的衣服上。

—And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
——两便士，他说，一品脱。把它扔到那里。

Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
斯蒂芬把两枚硬币扔到柔软的堆上。穿衣服，脱衣服。巴克·穆里根挺直身子，双手合十，庄严地说：

—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.
——偷窃穷人的，就是借给主。查拉图斯特拉如是说。

His plump body plunged.
肥硕的身躯倒了下去。

—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.
——我们会再次见到你，海恩斯说，当斯蒂芬走上小路时，海恩斯转过身来，对狂野的爱尔兰人微笑。

Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
公牛的角，马蹄，撒克逊人的微笑。

—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
——船，巴克·穆里根喊道。十二点半。

—Good, Stephen said.
——很好，史蒂芬说。

He walked along the upwardcurving path.
他沿着向上弯曲的小路走着。

Liliata rutilantium.
红叶百合。

Turma circumdet.
图尔马环德特。

Iubilantium te virginum.
Iubilantium te virginum。

The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
牧师的灰色光环放在壁龛里，他穿着得体。今晚我不会睡在这里。家我也不能去。

A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning the curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round.
一个声音甜美而持久，从海上呼唤着他。转过弯道，他挥了挥手。它又叫了。光滑的棕色脑袋，海豹的脑袋，远远地浮在水面上，圆圆的。

Usurper.
篡位者。


* * * * *

—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
——你，科克伦，哪个城市派人来找他的？

—Tarentum, sir.
——塔伦图姆，先生。

—Very good. Well?
-非常好。出色地？

—There was a battle, sir.
——发生了一场战斗，长官。

—Very good. Where?
-非常好。在哪里？

The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.
男孩一脸茫然地向空白的窗户问道。

Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?
由记忆的女儿们传说。但在某种程度上，即使不是记忆中所描述的那样，也是如此。那么，这是一个不耐烦的短语，是布莱克过度翅膀的重击。我听到所有空间的毁灭、玻璃破碎、砖石倒塌，以及最后一团青灰色的火焰。那我们还剩下什么？

—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
——我忘记那个地方了，先生。公元前 279 年

—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.
——阿斯库鲁姆，史蒂芬说，扫了一眼那本伤痕累累的书上的名字和日期。

—Yes, sir. And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for.
-是的先生。他说：再有一次这样的胜利，我们就完蛋了。

That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
全世界都记住了这句话。心里有一种沉闷的轻松。尸横遍地的平原上方的一座小山上，一位将军倚在长矛上对他的军官们讲话。任何将军对任何军官。他们倾听。

—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
——你，阿姆斯特朗，斯蒂芬说。皮洛士的结局是什么？

—End of Pyrrhus, sir?
——皮洛士的终结，先生？

—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
——我知道，先生。 “问我吧，先生，”科明说。

—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
-等待。你，阿姆斯特朗。你了解皮洛士吗？

A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.
阿姆斯特朗的书包里紧贴着一袋无花果卷。他时不时地把它们夹在手掌之间，然后轻轻地吞下去。面包屑粘在他嘴唇的组织上。男孩的呼吸甜甜的。富裕的人们为他们的长子在海军服役而感到自豪。维科路，达尔基。

—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
——皮洛士，先生？皮洛士，一个码头。

All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
大家都笑了。不愉快的高恶意笑声。阿姆斯特朗环视他的同学们，脸上露出傻乎乎的欢乐。过了一会儿，他们就会笑得更大声，因为他们知道我缺乏规则，也知道他们爸爸付的费用。

—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.
——现在告诉我，斯蒂芬用书戳了男孩的肩膀说，什么是码头。

—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
——一个码头，先生，阿姆斯特朗说。水里有东西。一种桥梁。金斯敦码头，先生。

Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.
有些人又笑了：虽然笑得很开心，但意味深长。后排的两个人窃窃私语。是的。他们知道：从来没有学过，也从来没有天真过。全部。他嫉妒地看着他们的脸：伊迪丝、埃塞尔、格蒂、莉莉。他们的喜好：他们的呼吸也因茶和果酱而变得甜美，他们的手镯在挣扎中咯咯作响。

—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
——金斯敦码头，斯蒂芬说。是的，一座令人失望的桥。

The words troubled their gaze.
这句话让他们的目光有些困扰。

—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
——怎么样，先生？科明问道。一座桥横跨一条河。

For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.
海恩斯的小册子。这里没人听。今晚，在疯狂的饮酒和交谈中，巧妙地刺穿他头脑中光洁的邮件。然后怎样呢？主人宫廷里的小丑，纵容和不尊重，却赢得了宽厚主人的称赞。他们为什么选择所有这些部分？不完全是为了光滑的爱抚。对他们来说，历史也是一个像其他经常听到的故事一样的故事，他们的土地是一家当铺。

Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.
如果皮洛士没有在阿尔戈斯被贝尔达姆之手倒下，或者朱利叶斯·凯撒没有被刀杀的话。他们不应该被忽视。时间给他们打上了烙印，将他们囚禁在被他们驱逐的无限可能性的房间里。但既然它们从未实现过，那么这些是否可能成为可能呢？或者这是唯一可能发生的事情？编织，风的编织者。

—Tell us a story, sir.
——给我们讲个故事吧，先生。

—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
——噢，做吧，先生。一个鬼故事。

—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
——你从哪里开始呢？史蒂芬一边问道，一边打开另一本书。

--Weep no more, Comyn said.
——别再哭了，科明说。

—Go on then, Talbot.
——那就继续吧，塔尔博特。

—And the story, sir?
——故事呢，先生？

—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
——之后，斯蒂芬说。继续吧，塔尔博特。

A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
一个黝黑的男孩打开一本书，灵活地把它放在书包的胸罩下。他一边背诵着断断续续的诗句，一边奇怪地扫视着文字：

—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
——别再哭泣，可悲的牧羊人，别再哭泣

 For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
因为利西达斯，你的悲伤尚未消亡，

 Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor …
尽管他沉没在水底之下……

It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.
那么它一定是一种运动，一种尽可能的现实。亚里士多德的短语在喋喋不休的诗句中形成，飘进圣吉纳维芙图书馆的勤奋寂静中，他在那里夜以继夜地读书，躲避巴黎的罪恶。一个精致的暹罗人在他的肘边拿着一本战略手册。我周围的大脑被喂食和喂食：在辉光灯下，被刺穿，触角微弱地跳动：在我心灵的黑暗中，一只来自地下世界的树懒，不情愿，羞于明亮，移动她的龙鳞状褶皱。思想就是思想的思想。宁静明亮。灵魂在某种程度上就是一切：灵魂是形式的形式。突然的、广阔的、炽热的宁静：形式的形式。

Talbot repeated:
塔尔博特重复道：

—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
——通过在波浪中行走的他的可爱力量，

 Through the dear might …
通过亲爱的力量……

—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.
——翻过来，斯蒂芬轻声说道。我什么也没看到。

—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
——什么，先生？塔尔博特向前弯腰简单地问道。

His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms. Ay.
他的手将这一页翻了过去。他刚刚想起来，靠在椅背上，又继续往前走。他在海浪中行走。在这里，他的影子也躺在这些胆怯的心上，落在嘲笑者的心上、嘴唇上，也落在我的心上。他们热切的脸上露出了向他献上贡品的硬币。对凯撒来说，就是凯撒的；对上帝来说，就是上帝的。黑眼睛里的目光很长，教堂的织布机上织着一个谜语般的句子。哎呀。

Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
给我谜语，给我谜语，兰迪·罗。

My father gave me seeds to sow.
父亲给了我播种的种子。

Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
塔尔博特把他合上的书放进书包里。

—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
——我都听到了吗？史蒂芬问。

—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
-是的先生。十点打曲棍球，先生。

—Half day, sir. Thursday.
——半天，先生。周四。

—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
——谁能回答一个谜语？史蒂芬问。

They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:
他们把书收起来，铅笔噼啪作响，书页沙沙作响。他们挤在一起，系好书包，扣上书包，欢快地叽叽喳喳地说着：

—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
——一个谜语，先生？问我吧，先生。

—O, ask me, sir.
——哦，问我吧，先生。

—A hard one, sir.
——很难，先生。

—This is the riddle, Stephen said:
——这就是谜语，斯蒂芬说：

The cock crew,
公鸡队，

The sky was blue:
天空是蓝色的：

The bells in heaven
天上的钟声

Were striking eleven.
十一人引人注目。

‘Tis time for this poor soul
现在是这个可怜的灵魂的时候了

To go to heaven.
去天堂。

What is that?
那是什么？

—What, sir?
——什么，先生？

—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.
——再说一遍，先生。我们没有听到。

Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence Cochrane said:
随着台词的重复，他们的眼睛变得更大。科克伦沉默了一会儿后说道：

—What is it, sir? We give it up.
——什么事，先生？我们放弃它。

Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
斯蒂芬喉咙发痒，回答道：

—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
——狐狸把他的祖母埋在冬青树下。

He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.
他站起来，紧张地大笑起来，他们的叫喊声中回响着沮丧的声音。

A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
一根棍子敲在了门上，走廊里有一个声音喊道：

—Hockey!
-曲棍球！

They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.
他们四散开来，从长凳上侧身而出，纵身一跃。他们很快就走了，杂物间里传来了棍棒的嘎嘎声以及他们靴子和舌头的喧闹声。

Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. His thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.
独自徘徊的萨金特缓缓走上前来，拿出一本打开的字帖。他浓密的头发和瘦削的脖子表明他还没有做好准备，透过雾蒙蒙的眼镜，虚弱的眼睛向上抬起来恳求。在他暗淡无血的脸颊上，有一块柔软的墨迹，枣状的，新近的，湿漉漉的，就像蜗牛的床一样。

He held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on the headline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
他拿出他的习字本。标题上写着“Sums”这个词。下面是倾斜的图形，脚下有一个带有盲环和污点的弯曲签名。西里尔·萨金特：他的名字和印章。

—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.
——迪西先生让我把它们全部写出来，他说，然后给你看，先生。

Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
斯蒂芬摸了摸书的边缘。无用。

—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
——你现在明白该怎么做了吗？他问。

—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.
——十一到十五，萨金特回答。迪西先生说我要把它们从黑板上抄下来，先生。

—Can you do them. yourself? Stephen asked.
——你能做到吗？你自己？史蒂芬问。

—No, sir.
-不，先生。

Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life? His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
丑陋而无用：瘦长的脖子、浓密的头发和一处墨迹，蜗牛的床。然而有人爱过他，把他抱在怀里，放在心里。要不是她，世界的种族就会把他踩在脚下，把他当作一只被压扁的无骨蜗牛。她曾爱过他从她自己身上抽干的虚弱的水样血液。那是真的吗？生命中唯一真实的事情？他母亲俯伏的身体，炽热的哥伦巴努斯以神圣的热情踏在上面。她已经不复存在：一根在火中燃烧的颤抖的树枝骨架，散发着红木和潮湿灰烬的气味。她救了他免遭践踏，然后就走了，但几乎没有。一个可怜的灵魂去了天堂：在闪烁的星星下的荒原上，一只狐狸，毛皮上散发着掠夺的红色臭气，用无情的明亮眼睛在地上刮擦，倾听，刮擦大地，倾听，刮擦，刮擦。

Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
坐在他身边的斯蒂芬解决了这个问题。他用代数证明莎士比亚的鬼魂就是哈姆雷特的祖父。萨金特透过倾斜的眼镜斜视着。储藏室里的曲棍球棒嘎嘎作响：空洞的球敲击声和球场上的叫喊声。

Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.
页面上的符号以严肃的莫里斯的方式移动，以它们的字母的哑剧形式移动，戴着方形和立方体的古色古香的帽子。向伙伴伸出双手、横过、鞠躬：如此：摩尔人幻想的小鬼。阿威罗伊和摩西·迈蒙尼德也离开了这个世界，他们的神态和动作都是黑暗的，在他们的嘲弄镜子中闪烁着世界的晦涩灵魂，黑暗中闪耀着光明无法理解的光明。

—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
-你现在明白了么？你能为自己做第二个工作吗？

—Yes, sir.
-是的先生。

In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. Amor matris: subjective and objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
萨金特用长长的颤抖的笔画抄写了数据。他的手总是在等待帮助，忠实地移动着不稳定的符号，暗淡的皮肤后面闪烁着淡淡的羞耻色彩。 Amor matris：主观所有格和客观所有格。她用她虚弱的血液和乳清酸奶喂养了他，并把他的襁褓藏了起来，不让其他人看到。

Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
我和他一样，肩膀倾斜，粗鲁无礼。我的童年在我身边弯曲。对我来说太远了，无法把手放在那里一次或轻轻地。我的距离很远，他的秘密就像我们的眼睛。秘密，无声无息，冷冰冰地坐在我们内心的黑暗宫殿里：秘密厌倦了他们的暴政：暴君，愿意被废黜。

The sum was done.
总算完成了。

—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
——这很简单，史蒂芬站起来说道。

—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
-是的先生。谢谢，萨金特回答。

He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.
他用一张薄薄的吸墨纸擦干了纸页，然后把他的习字本带回了他的长凳上。

—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.
——你最好拿起你的手杖，出去到其他人那里去，史蒂芬一边说，一边跟着男孩那不优雅的身形向门口走去。

—Yes, sir.
-是的先生。

In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
走廊里传来他的名字，是从操场上传来的。

—Sargent!
——萨金特！

—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
——继续跑，斯蒂芬说。迪西先生正在给你打电话。

He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He turned his angry white moustache.
他站在门廊上，看着落后的人匆匆走向杂乱的田野，田野里传来尖锐的争吵声。他们被分成几队，迪西先生脚上套着绑腿，踏着几片草丛走开。当他到达校舍时，争吵的声音再次呼唤他。他愤怒地翻动白胡子。

—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
——现在是什么情况？他不停地哭，不听。

—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
——科克伦和哈利迪站在同一边，先生，斯蒂芬说。

—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.
——你能在我的书房里等一下吗？迪西先生说，直到我恢复这里的秩序。

And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:
当他烦躁地走回田野时，他老人的声音严厉地喊道：

—What is the matter? What is it now?
-什么事？现在是什么情况？

Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
他们尖利的声音从四面八方围绕着他喊叫着：他们的形形色色的人形包围着他，耀眼的阳光漂白了他那染病的头上的蜂蜜。

Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.
书房里弥漫着陈旧的烟熏味，椅子上还弥漫着单调磨损皮革的味道。和第一天一样，他在这里和我讨价还价。一开始如此，现在也是如此。餐具柜上有一盘斯图亚特硬币，是沼泽地的基本宝藏：永远都是。舒适地放在紫色毛绒勺子盒里，褪色了，十二使徒向所有外邦人宣讲：世界永无止境。

A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
匆忙跨过石廊，走进走廊。迪西先生吹掉了他罕见的小胡子，在桌边停了下来。

—First, our little financial settlement, he said.
——首先，我们的小额财务结算，他说。

He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.
他从外套里拿出一个用皮丁字裤绑着的皮夹。它啪地打开了，他从里面拿出两张纸条，一张是连在一起的，小心翼翼地放在桌子上。

—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
——两个，他说，绑好钱包并收好。

And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.
现在是他的黄金储藏室。斯蒂芬尴尬的手抚摸着堆在冰冷的石臼中的贝壳：海螺、金钱贝壳和豹子贝壳：还有这个，像埃米尔的头巾一样旋转，还有这个，圣詹姆斯的扇贝。老朝圣者的宝库，死去的宝藏，空心的贝壳。

A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
一枚金币掉落在柔软的桌布上，又亮又新。

—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand. These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
——三，迪西先生一边说，一边转动手里的小储蓄罐。这些都是很方便的东西。看。这是针对主权者的。这是要先令的。六便士，半克朗。这里是皇冠。看。

He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
他从里面射出两克朗和两先令。

—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.
——三点十二分，他说。我想你会发现这是对的。

—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
——谢谢你，先生，史蒂芬说着，羞涩地匆忙把钱收集起来，放进裤子口袋里。

—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
——不用谢，迪西先生说。你已经赢得了它。

Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.
斯蒂芬的手又自由了，又回到了空心贝壳上。也是美丽和力量的象征。我口袋里的一个肿块：被贪婪和痛苦玷污的符号。

—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find them very handy.
——别这样带着它，迪西先生说。你会把它拉到某个地方然后就丢失了。您只需购买其中一台机器即可。你会发现它们非常方便。

Answer something.
回答一些事情。

—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
——我的经常是空的，斯蒂芬说。

The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant if I will.
同样的房间和时间，同样的智慧：我也一样。现在已经三次了。这里有三个绞索围着我。出色地？如果我愿意的话，我可以在这一刻打破它们。

—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’t know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? Put but money in thy purse.
——因为你不存钱，迪西先生指着手指说道。你还不知道钱是什么。金钱就是力量。当你和我一样长寿的时候。我知道我知道。若青春却知。但莎士比亚怎么说呢？钱包里只放钱。

—Iago, Stephen murmured.
——伊阿古，史蒂芬低声说道。

He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.
他将目光从闲置的贝壳上移开，转向老人的目光。

—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth?
——迪西先生说，他知道钱是什么。他赚钱了。是的，他是一位诗人，但也是一位英国人。你知道英国人的骄傲是什么吗？你知道从英国人嘴里听到的最自豪的话是什么吗？

The seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.
海洋的统治者。他冰冷的眼睛望着空荡荡的海湾：看来历史是罪魁祸首：我和我的话，没有仇恨。

—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
——斯蒂芬说，在他的帝国里，太阳永不落山。

—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.
——呸！迪西先生哭了。那不是英语。一位法国凯尔特人这么说。他用自己的储蓄罐敲了敲自己的缩略图。

—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I paid my way.
——我来告诉你，他严肃地说，他最自豪的夸耀是什么。我付了路费。

Good man, good man.
好人，好人。

—I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel that? I owe nothing. Can you?
——我付了路费。我一生中从未借过一先令。你能感觉到吗？我什么都不欠。你可以吗？

Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings. Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board. The lump I have is useless.
Mulligan，九磅，三双袜子，一双布洛克鞋，领带。库兰，十几尼。麦肯，一几尼。弗莱德·瑞安，两先令。寺庙，两顿午餐。拉塞尔，一畿尼，考辛斯，十先令，鲍勃·雷诺兹，半畿尼，科勒，三畿尼，麦凯南夫人，五周的伙食费。我的肿块没什么用。

—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
——目前还不行，史蒂芬回答道。

Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
迪西先生高兴地笑了，放回了他的储蓄箱。

—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. We are a generous people but we must also be just.
——我知道你不能，他高兴地说。但有一天你一定会感受到这一点。我们是慷慨的人民，但我们也必须公正。

—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
——我害怕那些大话，斯蒂芬说，这会让我们如此不高兴。

Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.
迪西先生在壁炉架上方严厉地盯着一个身着格子花呢长袍的身材匀称的男人看了一会儿：阿尔伯特·爱德华，威尔士亲王。

—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the famine in ‘46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.
——你认为我是一个老顽固和一个老保守党，他深思熟虑的声音说道。自奥康奈尔时代以来，我经历了三代人。我记得46年的饥荒。你知道橙色分会在奥康奈尔这样做之前，或者在你的圣餐主教谴责他是煽动者之前二十年，就煽动废除工会吗？你们芬尼派忘记了一些事情。

Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie down.
光荣、虔诚、不朽的记忆。戴蒙德在阿马的住所金碧辉煌，挂满了教皇的尸体。声音嘶哑，戴着面具，全副武装，种植园主的盟约。黑色北方和真蓝色圣经。庄稼躺着。

Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
斯蒂芬画了一个简短的手势。

—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all Irish, all kings’ sons.
——我身上也有叛逆的血液，迪西先生说。在主轴侧。但我是投票支持工会的约翰·布莱克伍德爵士的后裔。我们都是爱尔兰人，都是国王的儿子。

—Alas, Stephen said.
——唉，史蒂芬说。

—Per vias rectas, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.
——迪西先生坚定地说，“Per vias rectas”是他的座右铭。他投了赞成票，并穿上高筒靴从唐恩区骑马前往都柏林。

Lal the ral the ra
拉尔拉尔拉拉

The rocky road to Dublin.
通往都柏林的崎岖道路。

A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour! … Day! … Day! … Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.
一个粗暴的乡绅骑在马背上，穿着闪亮的高筒靴。美好的一天，约翰先生！柔软的一天，您的荣幸！ … 天！ … 天！ ……两只高筒靴在都柏林慢跑。拉尔拉尔拉拉。拉尔拉拉拉迪。

—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press. Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
——这让我想起了，迪西先生说。迪达勒斯先生，你可以和你的一些文学朋友一起帮我一个忙。我这里有一封给新闻界的信。坐下来一会儿。我只需复制结尾即可。

He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
他走到靠近窗户的桌子前，拉了两次椅子，从打字机鼓上读了一些字。

—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of common sense. Just a moment.
-坐下。对不起，他回头说道，这是常识。一会儿。

He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
他从浓密的眉毛下凝视着手肘旁的手稿，一边嘀咕着，一边开始慢慢地敲击键盘上僵硬的按钮，有时一边拧紧鼓，一边吹气以消除错误。

Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ Repulse, the duke of Westminster’s Shotover, the duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
斯蒂芬悄无声息地在王子面前坐下。墙壁周围挂着消失的马匹的图像，以示敬意，它们温顺的头悬在空中：黑斯廷斯勋爵的反击、威斯敏斯特公爵的沙特欧瓦、博福特公爵的锡兰，1866年巴黎大奖赛。精灵骑手坐在它们身上，警惕着符号。他看到了他们的速度，支持国王的颜色，并随着消失的人群的呼喊声喊道。

—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question …
——句号，迪西先生吩咐他拿钥匙。但这个至关重要的问题要及时解决……

Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush. Fair Rebel! Fair Rebel! Even money the favourite: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.
在那里，克兰利带领我快速致富，在溅满泥浆的刹车间、在球场上赌徒的叫喊声中、在食堂的臭味中、在杂乱的泥泞中寻找他的赢家。公平的叛逆者！公平的叛逆者！甚至金钱也是最受青睐的：十比一。我们匆匆走过切丁工和顶针工，追赶马蹄、争夺帽子和夹克，经过那个肉脸女人，一位屠夫的女士，口渴地用鼻子蹭着她的一瓣橙子。

Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.
男孩们的操场上传来尖锐的叫喊声和呼呼的口哨声。

Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.
再次：目标。我就在他们之中，在他们的身体之中，在一场生命的角逐中，相互搏斗。你是说那个外翻膝的妈妈的宝贝，看起来有点跛吗？比武。时间震撼反弹，震撼又震撼。比武、泥泞和喧嚣的战斗，被杀者的冰冻死亡呕吐物，用人们血淋淋的内脏作为诱饵的矛尖的喊叫。

—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
——那么，迪西先生站起身来说道。

He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
他来到桌边，把床单钉在一起。史蒂芬站了起来。

—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions on the matter.
——我已经把这件事简述了，迪西先生说。这是关于手足口病的。只要看一下就可以了。对于此事不能有两种意见。

May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.
我可以侵犯你的宝贵空间吗？这种自由放任的学说在我们的历史中屡见不鲜。我们的牲畜贸易。我们所有老工业的方式。利物浦环圈参与了戈尔韦港计划。欧洲大火。粮食通过狭窄的航道水域供应。农业部极其镇定。原谅一个经典的典故。卡桑德拉。是一个并不比她应有的更好的女人。说到正题。

—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
——我没有拐弯抹角吧？当斯蒂芬继续读下去时，迪西先生问道。

Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and virus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor’s horses at Murzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.
手足口病。称为科赫制剂。血清和病毒。咸马的百分比。牛瘟。下奥地利穆尔茨施泰格的皇帝马匹。兽医。亨利·布莱克伍德·普赖斯先生。礼貌地提供公平的审判。常识的规定。非常重要的问题。从任何意义上讲，都要不畏艰险。感谢您对专栏的热情款待。

—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the department. Now I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by … intrigues by … backstairs influence by …
——我希望将其打印出来并阅读，迪西先生说。你会看到，在下一次疫情爆发时，他们将对爱尔兰牛实施禁运。而且它是可以治愈的。它被治愈了。我的表弟布莱克伍德·普赖斯 (Blackwood Price) 写信给我，奥地利的牛医生经常治疗和治愈这种疾病。他们提出要到这里来。我正在努力扩大对部门的影响力。现在我要尝试一下宣传。我被困难、……阴谋、……幕后影响所包围。

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
他抬起食指，苍老地敲打着空气，声音才开口。

—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying.
——记住我的话，迪达勒斯先生，他说。英国在犹太人手中。在所有最高的地方：她的财务、她的媒体。它们是一个国家衰落的迹象。他们聚集到哪里，就会吞噬国家的元气。这些年来我已经看到了它的到来。正如我们站在这里一样，犹太商人已经开始了他们的破坏工作。老英格兰正在消亡。

He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
他迅速走开，当他们经过一束宽阔的阳光时，他的眼睛变得蓝色。他转身又回来。

—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
——快死了，他又说了一遍，即使现在还没有死。

The harlot’s cry from street to street
妓女的哭声从一条街传到另一条街

Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.
将编织旧英格兰的裹尸布。

His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.
他的眼睛睁得大大的，目光严厉地凝视着他停下来的阳光。

—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?
——斯蒂芬说，商人就是便宜买贵卖的人，无论是犹太人还是外邦人，不是吗？

—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.
——他们违背了光明，迪西先生严肃地说。你可以看到他们眼中的黑暗。这就是为什么他们至今仍是地球上的流浪者。

On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
在巴黎证券交易所的台阶上，金皮肤的男人们用镶有宝石的手指报出价格。大雁叽叽喳喳。他们大声地、粗鲁地在寺庙周围蜂拥而至，头戴笨拙的丝质帽子，脑袋里密密麻麻地密谋着。这些衣服、这些演讲、这些手势都不是他们的。他们那双迟钝的眼睛掩盖了话语、热切而无伤大雅的手势，但知道他们周围积满了怨恨，也知道他们的热情是徒劳的。徒劳的耐心堆积和囤积。时间肯定会冲散一切。路边堆积的宝藏：被掠夺并被传递。他们的眼睛知道他们漂泊的岁月，并且耐心地知道他们肉体的耻辱。

—Who has not? Stephen said.
——谁没有呢？斯蒂芬说。

—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
-你是什么意思？迪西先生问道。

He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.
他向前走了一步，站在桌边。他的下颌不确定地向一侧张开。这是古老的智慧吗？他在等待我的消息。

—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
——史蒂芬说，历史是一场噩梦，我正试图从中醒来。

From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
操场上，男孩们大声喊叫。呼呼的哨声：进球。如果那个噩梦给你带来了后背怎么办？

—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.
——造物主的道路不是我们的道路，迪西先生说。整个人类历史都朝着一个伟大的目标前进，那就是上帝的显现。

Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
斯蒂芬用拇指指着窗户，说道：

—That is God.
——那就是上帝。

Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
万岁！哎呀！呜哇！

—What? Mr Deasy asked.
-什么？迪西先生问道。

—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
——街上传来一声喊叫，史蒂芬耸耸肩回答道。

Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.
迪西先生低下头，用手指捏住了鼻翼一会儿。他再次抬起头，把他们放了出来。

—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.
——我比你幸福，他说。我们犯了很多错误，犯了很多罪。一个女人把罪恶带入了世界。对于一个并不比她应有的女人，墨涅拉俄斯的离家出走的妻子海伦来说，希腊人对特洛伊发动了十年的战争。一位不忠的妻子首先将陌生人带到了我们这里的海岸，麦克默罗的妻子和她的男人，布雷夫尼王子奥罗克。一个女人也让帕内尔低落。许多错误，许多失败，但不是单一的罪过。我现在是一个在生命的最后阶段的奋斗者。但我会为正义而战到底。

For Ulster will fight
因为阿尔斯特会战斗

And Ulster will be right.
阿尔斯特是对的。

Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.
斯蒂芬举起手中的床单。

—Well, sir, he began …
——嗯，先生，他开始……

—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong.
——我预见，迪西先生说，你不会在这里工作太久。我认为你生来就不是当老师的。也许我错了。

—A learner rather, Stephen said.
——确切地说，是一个学习者，斯蒂芬说。

And here what will you learn more?
在这里您将学到更多什么？

Mr Deasy shook his head.
迪西先生摇摇头。

—Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher.
-谁知道？他说。一个人要学习，就必须谦虚。但生活是伟大的老师。

Stephen rustled the sheets again.
史蒂芬又把床单弄得沙沙作响。

—As regards these, he began.
——说到这些，他开口道。

—Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them published at once.
——是的，迪西先生说。你那里有两份副本。如果你能立即发布它们。

 Telegraph. Irish Homestead.
电报。爱尔兰家园。

—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors slightly.
——我会尽力，斯蒂芬说，明天告诉你。我稍微认识两位编辑。

—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
——那就行了，迪西先生轻快地说。我昨晚写信给国会议员菲尔德先生今天，牲畜贸易商协会在 City Arms 酒店召开会议。我请他在开会前把我的信交给他。你看看能不能把它写进你的两篇论文里。这些是什么？

—The Evening Telegraph …
——《电讯晚报》……

—That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.
——这样就可以了，迪西先生说。没有时间可以浪费了。现在我必须回复我表弟的那封信。

—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you.
——早上好，先生，斯蒂芬一边说，一边把床单放进口袋里。谢谢。

—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
——一点也不，迪西先生一边说，一边搜查桌上的文件。我喜欢和你一起折断长矛，尽管我已经这么老了。

—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
——早上好，先生，史蒂芬再次说道，向他弯曲的背鞠了一躬。

He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.
他从敞开的门廊出去，沿着树下的碎石路走下去，听到操场上传来喊叫声和棍棒的劈啪声。当他走出大门时，狮子趴在柱子上：没有牙齿的恐怖。尽管如此，我还是会帮助他进行战斗。马里根会给我起一个新名字：与公牛交友的吟游诗人。

—Mr Dedalus!
——迪达勒斯先生！

Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
追着我跑。我希望不再有信件。

—Just one moment.
-只是一个瞬间。

—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
——是的，先生，史蒂芬说着，在门口转身。

Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
迪西先生停了下来，呼吸急促，咽了口气。

—I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No. And do you know why?
——我只是想说，他说。他们说，爱尔兰有幸成为唯一一个从未迫害过犹太人的国家。你知道吗？不。你知道为什么吗？

He frowned sternly on the bright air.
他对着明亮的空气皱起了眉头。

—Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
——为什么，先生？斯蒂芬微笑着问道。

—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
——因为她从来不让他们进来，迪西先生严肃地说。

A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.
一阵笑声从他喉咙里跳出来，拖着一连串嘎嘎作响的痰。他迅速转过身来，一边咳嗽一边大笑，举起的手臂向空中挥舞着。

—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.
——她从来不让他们进来，当他用绑腿踩在碎石路上时，他又笑着哭了。这就是为什么。

On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.
阳光透过树叶的方格图案，洒在他英明的肩膀上，金币翩翩起舞。

Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.
可见事物不可避免的形态：至少是通过我的眼睛思考的。我在这里阅读的所有东西的签名，海产卵和海残，即将到来的潮水，那只生锈的靴子。鼻涕绿、蓝银、铁锈色：彩色标志。透明度的限制。但他补充道：在身体里。然后他意识到他们面前的尸体是有颜色的。如何？当然，是通过用壁灯敲击他们。放轻松。他是个秃头、百万富翁、色彩大师。透明度的极限为 in。为什么为 in？迪亚芬，阿迪亚芬。如果你能用五个手指穿过它，即使不是门，它也是一扇门。闭上眼睛看看吧。

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six: the nacheinander. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, nebeneinander. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a’.
斯蒂芬闭上眼睛，听到他的靴子踩碎碎片和贝壳的声音。无论如何，你正在经历它。我是，一次迈出一步。非常短的时间穿过非常短的空间。五、六：nacheinander。确实如此：这就是听觉不可避免的形态。张开你的眼睛。不，耶稣！如果我从甲虫爬过他的基地的悬崖上掉下来，不可避免地会掉进尼贝尼南德！我在黑暗中过得很好。我的灰剑挂在我身边。用它敲击：他们做到了。我穿着他靴子的两只脚就在他腿的末端，nebeneinander。听起来很坚固：由洛斯德米乌戈斯的木槌制成。我是否正沿着桑迪蒙特海岸走向永恒？压碎，破裂，吱吱，吱吱。野生海钱。多米妮·迪西 (Dominie Deasy) 认为他们是“。”

Won’t you come to Sandymount,
你不来桑迪蒙特吗？

Madeline the mare?
母马玛德琳？

Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. Acatalectic tetrameter of iambs marching. No, agallop: deline the mare.
你瞧，节奏开始了。我听到。进行曲的抑止四音步。不，驰骋：勾画出母马的轮廓。

Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. Basta! I will see if I can see.
现在睁开你的眼睛。我会。一会儿。从那以后一切都消失了吗？如果我打开，我就永远处于黑色的adiaphane中。巴斯塔！我看看能不能看到。

See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.
现在看看。没有你的时候，一直在那里：并且永远存在，世界永无止境。

They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently, Frauenzimmer: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother. Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s gamp poked in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. Hello! Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.
小姐，他们小心翼翼地从莱希的露台上走下台阶，软弱无力地走下搁架式的海岸，张开的双脚陷入淤泥中。就像我，就像阿尔吉，归根结底是我们强大的母亲。一号大声地挥舞着助产士的包，另一个则把帐篷戳在海滩上。摆脱自由，出去度过一天。新娘街的已故帕特克·麦凯布夫人弗洛伦斯·麦凯布夫人深受哀悼。她的姐妹情谊之一让我尖叫着活过来。从无到有的创造。她包里装的是什么？一场流产，拖着脐带，安静地包裹在红润的羊毛里。所有的绳索都连接起来，将所有肉体的绳索缠绕在一起。这就是为什么神秘僧侣。你愿意像神一样吗？凝视你的肚脐。你好！金奇在这里。带我去伊登维尔。 Aleph，阿尔法：无，无，一。

Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel. Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting. Womb of sin.
亚当·卡德蒙的配偶和助手：赫瓦，裸体夏娃。她没有肚脐。凝视。无瑕疵的肚皮，鼓鼓的，像张紧绷的羊皮圆盾，不，白堆玉米，东方不朽，万古长存。罪恶的子宫。

Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will. From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A lex eterna stays about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred heresiarch’ In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.
我也是在罪恶的黑暗中孕育的，不是受生的。在他们身边，有我的声音和眼睛的男人，还有一个呼吸着灰烬的女鬼。他们紧握又分开，这符合情侣的意愿。从古往今来，他就愿意我，现在可能不会，或者永远不会。永恒法则始终围绕着他。那么这就是圣父与圣子同体的神圣本质吗？可怜的亲爱的阿里乌斯在哪里可以得出结论呢？他的一生长期与反超然的宏大和犹太教的现实性作斗争。在希腊的一个厕所里，他咽下了最后一口气：安乐死。戴着串珠主教冠和权杖，坐在王座上，是一位鳏夫教区的鳏夫，带着僵硬的 omophorion 和凝结的后腿。

Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves. The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.
空气在他周围跳跃，空气中充满了刺痛和渴望。他们来了，波浪。白鬃海马，驮着，明亮的风缰绳，马纳南的骏马。

I mustn’t forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.
我不能忘记他写给新闻界的信。之后？船，十二点半。顺便说一句，像一个年轻的傻瓜一样轻松地使用这笔钱。

Yes, I must.
是的，我必须。

His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not? My consubstantial father’s voice. Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately? No? Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt
他的脚步放慢了。这里。我到底去不去莎拉阿姨家？我同体父亲的声音。你最近有看到你的艺术家兄弟斯蒂芬吗？不？当然他没有和他的姨妈一起在斯特拉斯堡的露台上

Sally? Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!
莎莉？他就不能飞得更高一点吗？斯蒂芬，告诉我们，斯叔叔怎么样了？哦，哭泣的上帝啊，我嫁入的那些东西！男孩们在干草棚里。醉酒的小成本抽屉和他的吹短号的兄弟。非常值得尊敬的贡多拉船夫！沃尔特先生对他父亲的态度也同样扭曲！先生。是的先生。不，先生。耶稣哭了：难怪，靠基督！

I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.
我拉响了他们紧闭的小屋里喘息的门铃：然后等待。他们以为我是一个骗子，从一个有利的位置向外张望。

—It’s Stephen, sir.
——我是斯蒂芬，先生。

—Let him in. Let Stephen in.
——让他进来。让斯蒂芬进来。

A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.
螺栓拉开，沃尔特欢迎我。

—We thought you were someone else.
——我们以为你是别人。

In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the upper moiety.
里奇舅舅躺在宽大的床上，身上盖着枕头，盖着毯子，强壮的前臂伸过膝盖的小丘。胸前干净。他已经清洗了上部部分。

—Morrow, nephew.
——莫罗，侄子。

He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum. A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde’s Requiescat. The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.
他把笔记本放在一边，在高夫大师和沙普兰·坦迪大师的面前起草费用清单，提交同意书和共同搜查以及杜塞斯·特库姆的令状。他的光头上戴着一个波高克框架：王尔德的《安息猫》。他那令人误解的口哨声将沃尔特带了回来。

—Yes, sir?
-是的先生？

—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?
——给里奇和斯蒂芬的麦芽，告诉妈妈。她在哪？

—Bathing Crissie, sir.
——给克里西洗澡，先生。

Papa’s little bedpal. Lump of love.
爸爸的小睡友。爱的一团。

—No, uncle Richie …
——不，里奇叔叔……

—Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!
——叫我里奇吧。该死的你的锂水。它降低了。哈士奇！

—Uncle Richie, really …
——里奇叔叔，真的……

—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.
——坐下，否则哈利，按照法律，我会把你打倒的。

Walter squints vainly for a chair.
沃尔特徒劳地眯着眼睛寻找椅子。

—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.
——他没有什么可以坐下来的，先生。

—He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair. Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs here. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.
——他没地方放，你这个笨蛋。把我们的齐彭代尔椅子搬进来。你想吃点东西吗？这里没有你该死的法律行为。炸鲱鱼的味道浓郁吗？当然？那就更好了。我们家里除了背痛药什么也没有。

All’erta!
一切都好！

He drones bars of Ferrando’s aria di sortita. The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.
他嗡嗡地唱着费兰多的咏叹调。整个歌剧中最伟大的人物是斯蒂芬。听。

His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.
他那悦耳的口哨再次响起，声音细腻，伴随着空气的流动，他的拳头在垫着垫子的膝盖上敲打着。

This wind is sweeter.
这风更甜了

Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas father,— furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff! Descende, calve, ut ne amplius decalveris. A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (descende!), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.
我的、他的以及所有的房子都破烂不堪。你告诉克朗戈斯贵族，你有一个叔叔是法官，还有一个叔叔是军队里的将军。从他们里面出来吧，史蒂芬。美不在那里。也不是在马什图书馆的死气沉沉的海湾里，你在那里读到了约阿希姆·阿巴斯逐渐消失的预言。为了谁？大教堂里的百头乌合之众纷纷靠近。一个憎恨他的同类的人从他们身边跑到了疯狂的森林里，他的鬃毛在月亮上起泡沫，他的眼球像星星一样。慧骃，马鼻。椭圆形马脸、坦普尔、巴克·穆里根、福克西·坎贝尔、灯笼颚。阿巴斯的父亲，——愤怒的院长，什么罪行让他们的大脑着火了？噗！下降，犊牛，ut ne amplius decalveris。他头上戴着一顶花环的灰白头发，我看到他正爬到台阶上（下降！），抓着一个圣体圣体，戴着蛇怪。趴下，秃头！唱诗班回响着威胁和回声，在祭坛的号角声中助阵，牧师们哼着拉丁语，他们的肩膀魁梧，剃光头、涂油、骟头，身上涂满了小麦肾的脂肪。

And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.
与此同时，拐角处的一位牧师也许正在举起它。叮叮！与另一条街相隔两条街，将其锁在一个金字塔中。德林加德林！在一座女士教堂里，另一个人把家里的一切都放在了自己的脸颊上。叮叮！下、上、前、后。丹·奥卡姆想到了这一点，无敌医生。一个有雾的英国早晨，小恶魔的本质让他的大脑发痒。他把他的主人放下来，跪下，听到他的第二个铃与耳堂中的第一个铃缠绕在一起（他正在举起他的），然后站起来，听到（现在我正在举起）他们的两个铃（他跪着）发出双元音的声音。

Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully holy, weren’t you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street. O si, certo! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw. More tell me, more still!! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: Naked women! naked women! What about that, eh?
斯蒂芬表弟，你永远不会成为圣人。圣人岛。你非常圣洁，不是吗？你向圣母祈祷，希望你不要有红鼻子。你向蛇形大道上的魔鬼祈祷，希望前面那个毛茸茸的寡妇能把衣服从湿漉漉的街道上脱得更多。哦，你好！为此出卖你的灵魂，做吧，把染色的破布钉在女人身上。更多告诉我，更多！霍斯电车顶上独自向雨哭泣：裸体女人！裸体女人！那个怎么样，嗯？

What about what? What else were they invented for?
什么什么？它们的发明还有什么用途？

Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young. You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once …
每晚读七本书，每本书两页，是吗？我曾经年轻。你对着镜子里的自己鞠了一躬，上前认真鼓掌，表情引人注目。为这个该死的白痴欢呼！哎呀！无人看见：不告诉任何人。您要用字母作为标题写的书。你读过他的F吗？ O 是的，但我更喜欢 Q。是的，但 W 很棒。哦，是的，W。还记得你写在绿色椭圆形叶子上的顿悟吗，深深地，如果你死了，就会把副本寄给世界上所有伟大的图书馆，包括亚历山大？几千年后，会有人在那里阅读它们，mahamanvantara。米兰多拉之皮像。嗯，很像鲸鱼。当一个人读到那些早已逝去的人的这些奇怪的书页时，你会感觉自己与曾经的一个人融为一体……

The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man’s ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.
他脚下的沙粒已经消失了。他的靴子再次踩在潮湿的桅杆上，噼啪作响，刀锋般的贝壳，吱吱作响的鹅卵石，在无数的鹅卵石上跳动，被船蛆筛过的木头，失去了无敌舰队。不健康的沙地等待着吸吮他踩着的脚底，向上呼吸着污水，在人类骨灰的掩埋下，有一袋在海火中闷烧的海藻。他小心翼翼地让他们滑行。一只波特酒瓶在松软的沙面团中直立起来，直挺挺地站到腰部。哨兵：极度干渴的岛屿。岸边的铁圈坏了；陆地上布满了黑暗狡猾的网；更远的地方有粉笔画的后门，较高的海滩上有一条晾衣绳，上面挂着两件钉在十字架上的衬衫。林森德：棕色舵手和水手大师的棚屋。人类的贝壳。

He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s. Am I not going there? Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse.
他停了下来。我已经路过萨拉阿姨家了。我不去那里吗？看来不是。无人问津。他转向东北，穿过坚硬的沙地，朝鸽舍走去。

—Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?
—您是否错了 cette fichue 位置？

—c’est le pigeon, Joseph.
——这就是鸽子，约瑟夫。

Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon. Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father’s a bird, he lapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue, plump bunny’s face. Lap, lapin. He hopes to win in the gros lots. About the nature of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me La Vie de Jesus by M. Leo Taxil. Lent it to his friend.
帕特里斯休假回家，和我在麦克马洪酒吧喝着热牛奶。巴黎的凯文·伊根（Kevin Egan）是大雁之子。我的父亲是一只小鸟，他用粉红色的小舌头和肥嘟嘟的兔子脸舔着甜甜的牛奶酱。拉普，拉普。他希望能在总抽奖中获胜。关于他在米什莱读到的关于女性本质的内容。但他必须寄给我利奥·塔西尔先生的《耶稣的生活》。借给他朋友了。

—C’est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas en l’existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire a mon p-re.
——这就是托尔丹，你保存吧。我，我是社会主义者。我不知道主的存在。 Faut pas le dire a mon p-re。

—Il croit?
——伊尔克罗伊特？

—Mon pere, oui.
——亲爱的，我的。

Schluss. He laps.
施卢斯。他跑了一圈。

My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want puce gloves. You were a student, weren’t you? Of what in the other devil’s name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: physiques, chimiques et naturelles. Aha. Eating your groatsworth of mou en civet, fleshpots of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural tone: when I was in Paris; boul’ Mich’, I used to. Yes, used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. Lui, c’est moi. You seem to have enjoyed yourself.
我的拉丁四分之一帽子。天哪，我们必须简单地打扮这个角色。我想要深褐色手套。你曾经是一名学生，不是吗？以另一个魔鬼的名义是什么？佩萨耶恩。 P.C.N.，你知道：体质、化学和自然。啊哈。吃着大量的麝香猫，埃及的肉锅，被打嗝的马车夫用肘部推着。用最自然的语气说：我在巴黎的时候； bou'Mich'，我以前也是这样。是的，如果他们在某个地方因谋杀罪逮捕了你，你可以随身携带打孔票以证明不在场。正义。 1904 年 2 月 17 日晚上，两名目击者见到了这名囚犯。其他人做到了：另一个我。帽子、领带、大衣、鼻子。 Lui，这就是我。看来你玩得很开心。

Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a dispossessed. With mother’s money order, eight shillings, the banging door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger toothache. Encore deux minutes. Look clock. Must get. Ferme. Hired dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not hurt? O, that’s all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that’s all right. Shake a shake. O, that’s all only all right.
骄傲地走着。你想像谁一样走路？忘：一无所有。带着母亲的汇票，八先令，邮局的大门被引座员砰地关在你面前。饥饿牙痛。再来一分钟。看时钟。必须得到。费梅。雇了狗！用霰弹枪把他打成血肉模糊的碎片，碎片溅满了墙上所有的黄铜纽扣。一切都叮叮当当地就位。不疼？哦，没关系。握手。明白我的意思了吧？哦，没关系。摇一摇。噢，这样就可以了。

You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: Euge! Euge! Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the slimy pier at Newhaven. Comment? Rich booty you brought back; Le Tutu, five tattered numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:
你本来想创造奇迹，什么？火热的哥伦巴努斯之后前往欧洲传教。菲阿克和斯科特斯在天堂里坐在他们那令人毛骨悚然的凳子上，从他们的品脱壶里溢出来，大声拉丁笑：尤吉！尤吉！当你拖着行李箱，搬运工三便士，穿过纽黑文黏糊糊的码头时，假装说着蹩脚的英语。评论？你带回来的丰富战利品； Le Tutu，五件破烂的 Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge；一封蓝色的法国电报，好奇心的表现：

—Mother dying come home father.
——母亲临终，父亲回家。

The aunt thinks you killed your mother. That’s why she won’t.
阿姨认为你杀了你的母亲。这就是为什么她不会。

Then here’s a health to Mulligan’s aunt
祝穆里根的阿姨身体健康

And I’ll tell you the reason why.
我会告诉你原因。

She always kept things decent in
她总是把一切都保持得体

The Hannigan famileye.
汉尼根家族的眼睛。

His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.
他的双脚以突然而自豪的节奏踏过沙沟，沿着南墙的巨石前进。他骄傲地看着它们，一堆堆石制猛犸象头骨。金色的光芒洒在海面上、沙滩上、巨石上。那里有阳光、细长的树木、柠檬屋。

Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife’s lover’s wife, the kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In Rodot’s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering with gold teeth chaussons of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the pus of flan breton. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased pleasers, curled conquistadores.
巴黎刚刚醒来，柠檬色的街道上阳光刺眼。面包片的湿润髓质、青蛙绿色的艾草和她的晨香，都在向空气中倾诉。贝罗莫从他妻子的情人的妻子的床上站起来，这位包着头巾的家庭主妇动了动，手里拿着一碟醋酸。在罗多的《伊冯娜》和《玛德琳》中，她们的美人跌倒了，用金牙咬碎糕点，她们的嘴因布列塔尼果馅饼的脓而变黄。巴黎男人的面孔一闪而过，他们的讨好者，卷发的征服者。

Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers smeared with printer’s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. Un demi setier! A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me at his beck. Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui! She thought you wanted a cheese hollandais. Your postprandial, do you know that word? Postprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: slainte! Around the slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy’s fang thrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of men. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You’re your father’s son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. Vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, La Patrie, M. Millevoye, Felix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken, bonne a tout faire, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. Moi faire, she said, Tous les messieurs. Not this Monsieur, I said. Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn’t let my brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I see you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.
中午睡觉了。凯文·伊根（Kevin Egan）用沾有打印机墨水的手指卷起火药香烟，一边啜饮着他的绿色仙女，一边啜饮着帕特里斯的白色仙女。关于我们，贪吃者将五香豆叉进他们的食道。 Un demi setier！锃亮的大锅里喷出一股咖啡蒸汽。她听从他的吩咐为我服务。这是爱尔兰人。荷兰人？非干酪。 Deux irlandais，nous，Irlande，vous savez ah，oui！她以为你想要一份荷兰奶酪。你的餐后，你知道这个词吗？餐后。我曾经在巴塞罗那认识一个家伙，一个奇怪的家伙，过去常常称其为餐后。好吧：斯兰特！平板桌子周围是酒味交织的气息和咕噜咕噜的峡谷。他的呼吸悬在我们沾满酱汁的盘子上，绿色仙女的尖牙插在他的嘴唇之间。爱尔兰，达尔卡西亚人，希望，阴谋，现在的阿瑟·格里菲斯，A E，皮曼德，人类的好牧人。把我当作他的同伙，我们的罪行是我们共同的事业。你是你父亲的儿子。我认识那个声音。他穿着红花的粗纺衬衫，西班牙流苏因他的秘密而颤抖。 M. Drumont，著名记者，Drumont，知道他怎么称呼维多利亚女王吗？黄牙的老太婆。老女妖与黄凹痕。莫德·冈、美丽的女人、拉帕特里、米勒沃伊先生、菲利克斯·福尔，知道他是怎么死的吗？淫荡的男人。那个在乌普萨拉的浴室里摩擦男性裸体的怪物，bonne a tout faire。 Moi faire，她说，Tous les Messieurs。不是这位先生，我说。最淫乱的风俗。洗澡是一件最私密的事情。我不会让我的兄弟，甚至是我自己的兄弟，做出最淫荡的事情。绿色的眼睛，我看到你了。方，我感觉。淫荡之人。

The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw facebones under his peep of day boy’s hat. How the head centre got away, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.
蓝色的导火线在双手之间致命地燃烧，并烧得干干净净。松散的烟丝着火：火焰和辛辣的烟雾照亮了我们的角落。他那顶白日男孩的帽子下露出了粗糙的脸骨。头部中心是如何逃脱的，真实版本。年轻的新娘起身，男人，面纱，橙花，驱车驶向马拉海德。做到了，信仰。失去的领导者，被背叛的人，疯狂的逃亡者。伪装，抓紧了，消失了，不在这里。

Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you. I’ll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day’s stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d’Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in rue Git-le-Coeur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing’s. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat you saw me, won’t you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. Mon fils, soldier of France. I taught him to sing The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades. Know that old lay? I taught Patrice that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow’s castle on the Nore. Goes like this. O, O. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.
被抛弃的爱人。我告诉你，那时我还是个身材魁梧的年轻戈松。有一天我会向你展示我的肖像。我是，信仰。情人，为了她的爱，他和理查德·伯克上校，他的圣堂的牧师，在克勒肯韦尔的墙下徘徊，蹲下，看到复仇的火焰将他们在雾气中向上抛起。玻璃破碎，砖石倒塌。他躲在同性恋的帕里，巴黎的伊根，除了我之外，没有任何人发现他。制作他一天的车站，肮脏的印刷箱，他的三个小酒馆，他在蒙马特的巢穴，他在古特多尔大街上过夜，上面镶嵌着逝者的苍蝇脸。无爱、无土地、无妻子。没有她的被遗弃的男人、吉特勒科尔街的夫人、金丝雀和两个雄鹿房客，她感到非常舒服。桃色的脸颊，斑马纹的裙子，像年轻人一样活泼。被唾弃又不绝望。告诉帕特你看到我了，不是吗？我曾经想给可怜的帕特找一份工作。 Mon fils，法国士兵。我教他唱歌 基尔肯尼的男孩们是粗壮的咆哮刀锋。认识那个老外吗？我教帕特里斯的。老基尔肯尼：圣卡尼斯，强弓位于诺尔河畔的城堡。像这样进行。哦，哦。他拉着我，纳珀·坦迪，的手。

O, O THE BOYS OF
噢，噢，男孩们

KILKENNY …
基尔肯尼 …

Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them. Remembering thee, O Sion.
我的手无力浪费。他们忘记了凯文·伊根，而不是他忘记了他们。记住你，锡安啊。

He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots. The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back.
他已经接近海边了，湿沙拍打着他的靴子。新的空气迎接他，在狂野的神经中回荡，狂野的空气中充满了光明的种子。在这里，我不会走向基什灯塔，不是吗？他突然站了起来，双脚开始慢慢地陷入颤抖的土壤中。回头。

Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their—blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon’s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore’s tempting flood.
他转过身，扫视着南边的海岸，双脚再次慢慢地陷入新的插座中。塔楼冰冷的圆顶房间等待着。当我的脚下沉时，光柱穿过巴巴坎，一直缓慢地移动，在表盘地板上向暮色爬行。蓝色的黄昏，黄昏，深蓝色的夜。在黑暗的圆顶里，他们等待着，他们的推背椅，我的方尖碑手提箱，围着一块废弃的盘子。谁来清除它？他有钥匙。当这个夜晚到来时，我不会睡在那里。一座寂静塔楼的一扇紧闭的门，埋葬着他们——盲目的身体、黑豹萨希布和他的教鞭。打电话：无人接听。他把脚从洼地里抬起来，又在巨石边转了回来。全部拿走，全部保留。我的灵魂与我同行，形式的形式。于是，在月亮的中点，我穿着银色的貂皮衣服，在岩石上方的小路上踱步，聆听着埃尔西诺诱人的洪水声。

The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.
洪水追随我。我可以从这里看着它流过。然后沿着普尔贝格路返回到那里的海滩。他爬过莎草和水草，坐在石凳上，把他的白蜡树搁在一个草丛里。

A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. Un coche ensablé Louis Veuillot called Gautier’s prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout’s toys. Mind you don’t get one bang on the ear. I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.
一具肿胀的狗尸体躺在膀胱残骸上。在他面前是一艘沉入沙中的船舷。路易·维洛（Louis Veuillot）将戈蒂埃的散文称为《Un coche ensablé》。这些重沙是语言潮和风淤积在这里的。而这些，是死去的建筑工人的石堆，是黄鼠狼老鼠的巢穴。把金子藏在那里。尝试一下。你有一些。沙子和石头。沉重的过去。劳特爵士的玩具。请注意，不要让你的耳朵受到任何撞击。我是那该死的巨人，滚滚着所有该死的巨石，骨头作为我的踏脚石。费法夫姆。我是一名爱尔兰人。

A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand. Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?
一个点，活生生的狗，在沙地上跑过，逐渐进入视野。主啊，他要攻击我吗？尊重他的自由。你不会成为别人的主人或他们的奴隶。我有我的棍子。稳坐。从更远的地方，走过波峰潮水，向岸边走去，有两个人影。两个玛丽。他们把它安全地藏在芦苇丛中。躲猫猫。我看见你。不，是狗。他正跑回他们身边。 WHO？

Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.
洛克兰人的桨帆船驶向这里的海滩，寻找猎物，他们血喙般的船头低低地踏在熔化的白镴海浪上。丹麦维京人，当玛拉基佩戴金项圈时，战斧的饰环在他们的胸前闪闪发光。一群绿皮鲸在炎热的中午搁浅，在浅滩上喷着水，一瘸一拐。然后，从饥饿的笼子城市里，一群穿着紧身衣的矮人，我的人民，拿着剥皮刀，奔跑着，攀爬着，砍着绿色的鲸脂鲸肉。饥荒、瘟疫和屠杀。他们的血在我体内，他们的欲望在我体内。我在冰冻的利菲河上在他们中间移动，我，一个换生灵，在飞溅的树脂火焰中。我没有和任何人说话：没有人跟我说话。

The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. Terribilia meditans. A primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The Bruce’s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York’s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned. All kings’ sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur’s yelping. But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of … We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. Natürlich, put there for you. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden’s rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can’t see! Who’s behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. I … With him together down … I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.
狗叫声朝他跑来，停下来，又跑回来。我敌人的狗。我只是苍白地站着，一声不吭，大叫着。泰里比利亚Meditans。报春花紧身衣，命运的无赖，对我的恐惧微笑。你是否正为此渴望他们的掌声？伪装者：过他们的生活。布鲁斯的兄弟，托马斯·菲茨杰拉德，丝绸骑士，珀金·沃贝克，约克的假后裔，穿着白玫瑰象牙丝绸马裤，是一天的奇迹，兰伯特·西姆内尔，带着南斯和萨特勒的尾巴，一个戴王冠的仆人。皆为国王之子。过去和现在都是伪装者的天堂。他救了溺水的人，你会因为野狗的叫喊而颤抖。但《奥尔圣米歇尔》中嘲笑圭多的朝臣却是在自己家里。 ……之家我们不需要你们任何中世纪的深奥难懂。你会做他所做的事吗？一艘船就在附近，一个救生圈。 Natürlich，给你放在那里。你愿意还是不愿意？九天前在梅登岩石上淹死的那个人。他们现在正在等他。真相，说出来吧。我愿意。我会尝试。我不是一个游泳健将。水凉软。当我把脸放进克朗戈斯的水池里时。看不到！谁在我身后？快点出来，快点！你是否看到潮水从四面八方快速涌来，迅速覆盖了贝壳色的沙洼？如果我脚下有土地就好了。我希望他的生活仍然是他的，我的生活仍然是我的。一个溺水的人。他的人类眼睛因对他死亡的恐惧而向我尖叫。我……随着他一起倒下……我无法拯救她。沃特斯：苦死：迷失。

A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.
一个女人和一个男人。我看到了她的裙子。我敢打赌，已经固定了。

Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.
他们的狗在逐渐缩小的沙岸上漫步，一边小跑，一边嗅着四周。寻找前世遗失的东西。突然，他像一只跳跃的野兔一样逃跑，耳朵向后张开，追逐一只低空飞翔的海鸥的影子。男人尖锐的口哨声传入他无力的耳朵。他转过身，向后一跳，走近了一些，用闪闪发光的小腿小跑着。在田野上，一只雄鹿，绊倒了，正经的，没穿衣服。在潮水的边缘，他停了下来，前蹄僵硬，耳朵指向大海。他抬起鼻子，对着海浪的噪音咆哮，一群海龟。它们蜿蜒向他的脚走去，卷曲、展开许多波峰，每隔九个波峰，从远处、从更远的地方破碎、溅起，一波又一波。

Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.
扒蛤者。他们在水中涉水了一小段距离，弯下腰，浸湿了袋子，然后再次提起它们，涉水而出。那只狗尖叫着跑向他们，直立起来，用爪子抓他们，然后四肢着地，再次向他们直立起来，发出无声的、熊熊的讨好声。当他们走向干燥的沙地时，他没有留意，一直跟在他们身边，一条狼舌头从他的下巴里吐出来。他布满斑点的身体在他们前面慢悠悠地走着，然后像小牛一样疾驰而去。尸体躺在他的路上。他停下来，嗅了嗅，绕过它，兄弟，凑近了，绕过了它，像狗一样在死狗的脏兮兮的地上快速地抽鼻子。狗头骨，狗嗅，眼睛盯着地面，朝着一个伟大的目标前进。啊，可怜的狗！这里躺着可怜的狗的尸体。

—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
——破烂！就这样吧，你这个杂种！

The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk back in a curve. Doesn’t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock. and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.
叫声让他躲回到主人身边，一脚粗鲁的无靴踢把他踢到了一片沙地上，蹲着逃跑，毫发无伤。他弯着腰向后退了一步。没有看到我。他沿着鼹鼠的边缘懒洋洋地走着，磨蹭着，闻到了一块石头的味道。一只翘起的后腿从下面对着它撒尿。他向前小跑，再次抬起后腿，对着一块未熔炼的岩石迅速撒了尿。穷人的简单快乐。然后他的后爪撒开沙子；然后他的前爪涉水钻探。他埋在那里的东西，他的祖母。他在沙子里扎根，涉水、钻探，停下来听空气的声音，用爪子的愤怒再次刮起沙子，很快就停止了，一只豹子，一只豹子，陷入了婚姻破裂，吞噬着死者。

After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway. Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red carpet spread. You will see who.
昨晚他叫醒我之后，还是做了同样的梦吗？等待。开放式走廊。妓女街。记住。哈伦·阿尔·拉希德。我快要实现了。那个人引导我，说话。我并不害怕。他把瓜放在我脸上。微笑：奶油水果味。说，这就是规则。在。来。红地毯铺开。你会看到是谁。

Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair trailed. Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend’s whiteness under her rancid rags. Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.
红色埃及人肩负着行囊，艰难前行。他翻起裤子的蓝色脚拍打着湿冷的沙子，一条暗淡的砖围巾勒住了他没刮胡子的脖子。她迈着女人的脚步跟着：恶棍和他的流浪汉。她的背上挂着战利品。松散的沙子和贝壳沙砾使她的赤脚结了痂。她脸上的头发垂下来。在她的主人身后，他的助手，向罗姆维尔驶去。当夜晚掩盖了她身体的缺陷时，她在棕色披肩下从狗陷入泥潭的拱门里呼唤。她的情人正在布莱克皮茨的奥洛林医院治疗两名皇家都柏林患者。打她，用盗贼的朗姆酒行话，因为，哦，我的昏暗的瓦普戴尔！腐臭的破布下露出牧羊人的苍白。那天晚上，富姆巴利的小巷里：制革厂的气味。

White thy fambles, red thy gan
白色你的寓言，红色你的甘

And thy quarrons dainty is.
你的夸隆很美味。

Couch a hogshead with me then.
那就和我一起坐沙发吧。

In the darkmans clip and kiss.
在黑暗中剪辑和亲吻。

Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, frate porcospino. Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: thy quarrons dainty is. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.
阿奎那·坦贝利称这种忧郁的喜悦为“兄弟猪猪”。未堕落的亚当骑马行驶，没有车辙。让他走开吧：你的夸隆很美味。语言一点也不比他差。僧侣之词、玛丽珠在他们的腰带上叽叽喳喳；流氓词、坚韧的金块在他们的口袋里啪嗒啪嗒地响。

Passing now.
现在过去了。

A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, oinopa ponton, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. Omnis caro ad te veniet. He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss.
侧眼看着我的哈姆雷特帽子。如果我坐在这里时突然赤身裸体怎么办？我不是。穿越万界风沙，跟随太阳的火焰之剑，向西，跋涉到黄昏之地。她艰难地跋涉、拖拉、训练、拖拉、搬运她的货物。一股潮水在她身后西行，随月而行。潮汐，无数的岛屿，在她体内，不是我的血，奥伊诺帕浮桥，一片酒红色的海洋。看那月亮的使女。睡梦中，潮湿的星座称她为“时刻”，叫她起床。新娘床、产床、死亡之床、鬼烛。 Omnis caro ad te veniet。他来了，苍白的吸血鬼，透过他的眼睛，他的蝙蝠航行在血腥的大海上，嘴对着她的嘴亲吻。

Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.
这里。把别针钉在那家伙身上，好吗？我的平板电脑。嘴向她亲吻。

No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth’s kiss.
不，必须是他们两个。把它们粘好。嘴对着她的嘴亲吻。

His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb. Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy’s letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words. That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.
他的嘴唇张开，吐出无肉的空气嘴唇：嘴对着她的子宫。 Oomb，子宫坟墓。他的嘴发出无声的呼吸：哦哦哦：瀑布般的行星的咆哮，球体，炽热，咆哮远远远远。纸。钞票，炸掉它们。老迪西的信。这里。感谢您的盛情款待，撕下空白的一端。他背对着太阳，弯下腰，在一张岩石桌子前潦草地写着字。我有两次忘记从图书馆柜台拿纸条了。

His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat: yes, that’s right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.
当他弯腰结束时，他的影子落在岩石上。为什么不无尽地到达最远的星星呢？黑暗中，他们就在这光的后面，黑暗在光明中闪耀，仙后座三角洲，世界。白天，我穿着借来的凉鞋，拿着占卜师的灰烬棒坐在那儿，白天在青色的大海旁边，无人看见，在紫罗兰色的夜晚，在粗野的星星统治下行走。我把这结束的影子从我身边扔出去，人形不可避免，把它叫回来。无尽的，它会是我的，我的形式的形式吗？谁在这儿看着我？谁会在任何地方读到这些文字？白色田野上的标志。用你最流畅的声音对某个人说。克洛因的好主教从他的铲子帽中取下了神庙的面纱：空间的面纱，其上孵化着彩色的标志。用力坚持。在平面上着色：是的，没错。我看到平坦，然后思考距离，近，远，我看到平坦，东，后。啊，现在看看！突然向后倒去，冻结在立体镜中。点击就可以了。你觉得我的话很阴暗。黑暗存在于我们的灵魂中，你不觉得吗？弗鲁捷.我们的灵魂因罪孽而受到羞辱，更加依附于我们，就像女人依附于她的爱人一样，越依附愈。

She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings, piuttosto. Where are your wits?
她信任我，她的手温柔，长睫毛的眼睛。现在我到底要把她带到什么地方呢？进入不可避免的视觉的不可避免的形态。她，她，她。她什么？周一，处女在霍奇斯·菲吉斯的橱窗里寻找一本你要写的字母书。你敏锐地看了她一眼。手腕穿过遮阳伞的辫子杰西。她住在利森公园，带着悲伤和踢车，是一位文学女士。跟别人说说这个，史蒂维：来个pickmeup。我敢打赌，她穿着上帝的诅咒吊带和黄色长袜，上面用块状羊毛缝补。谈论苹果饺子，piuttosto。你的智慧在哪里？

Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.
触碰我。眼神温柔。手软软软的。我在这里很孤独。噢，快点碰我吧，现在。所有人都知道的这个词是什么？我一个人在这里很安静。也很伤心。摸摸我，摸摸我。

He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pock his hat. His hat down on his eyes. That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona. Alo! Bonjour. Welcome as the flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan’s hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.
他在尖锐的岩石上伸展身体，把潦草的便条和铅笔塞进帽子的口袋里。他的帽子垂在眼睛上。这是我做出的凯文·伊根的动作，点头示意他小睡，安息日的睡眠。等神。 Eeterant valde bona。哎哟！你好。如同五月的鲜花一样迎接您的到来。在它的叶子下，他透过孔雀叽叽喳喳的睫毛观察着南下的太阳。我陷入了这燃烧的场景中。潘时，动物中午。在粘稠的蛇类植物中，有泌乳的果实，黄褐色的水面上叶子宽阔。痛苦已远去。

And no more turn aside and brood.
不再转身沉思。

His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs, nebeneinander. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another’s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. Tiens, quel petit pied! Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its name. His arm: Cranly’s arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I am. As I am. All or not at all.
他的目光凝视着他的宽趾靴子，那是公鹿的下脚料，nebeneinander。他数着皱巴巴的皮革的折痕，另一个人的脚曾在其中温暖地嵌套过。那只踩在三足上的脚，我不喜欢的脚。但当埃丝特·奥斯瓦尔特的鞋子穿在你身上时，你很高兴：我在巴黎认识的女孩。天狮，小馅饼！坚定的朋友，灵魂的兄弟：王尔德不敢说出名字的爱。他的手臂：克兰利的手臂。他现在就要离开我了。责备呢？如我一般。如我一般。全部或全部不。

In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.
从科克湖的长套索中，水流满了，覆盖着绿色金色的沙泻湖，上升，流动。我的梣木会飘走。我会等待。不，他们会继续前行，继续前行，在低矮的岩石上摩擦，旋转，继续前行。最好快点完成这项工作。听：四字波浪语音：seesoo、hrss、rsseeiss、ooos。在海蛇、饲养的马匹和岩石中，有强烈的海水气息。在岩石杯中，它会倾斜：扑通，倾斜，拍打：被限制在桶中。然后，它的言语就停止了。它流淌，流淌，宽阔，浮泡，花开。

Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit. To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.
在汹涌的潮水下，他看到扭动的水草懒洋洋地抬起来，不情愿地摇动着手臂，竖起衬裙，在低语的水中摇曳着腼腆的银叶。日复一日，夜复一夜：抬起，淹没，落下。主啊，他们疲倦了；他们轻声叹息。圣安布罗斯听到了，树叶和波浪的叹息，等待着，等待着他们的时代的圆满，diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens inemiscit。没有尽头的聚集；然后徒劳地释放，流淌，返回：月亮的织机。她也厌倦了看到情人、好色的男人、在宫廷里闪闪发光的裸体女人，她汲取了水的辛劳。

Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. We have him. Easy now.
那里有五英寻。你父亲躺着五英寻。一次，他说。被发现溺水身亡。都柏林酒吧水位高。在它前面行驶的是一片松散的瓦砾、成群的鱼群和愚蠢的贝壳。一具咸白色的尸体从暗流中升起，像海豚一样一步步向陆地移动。他在那。快点挂起来吧拉。尽管他沉没在水底之下。我们有他。现在很容易。

Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.
一袋尸气浸在恶臭的盐水中。一袋小鱼，一块海绵般的肥肉，从他纽扣裤衩的缝隙中闪过。神变成人，变成鱼，变成藤壶鹅，变成羽毛山。我活着，呼吸着死亡的气息，踏着死亡的尘土，吞噬着所有死者的粪便。他被拖过船舷，向上呼吸绿色坟墓的恶臭，他的麻风鼻孔在阳光下打鼾。

A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man. Old Father Ocean. Prix de paris: beware of imitations. Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.
这次发生了翻天覆地的变化，棕色的眼睛是盐蓝色的。海死，人类已知的所有死亡中最温和的。海洋老父亲。巴黎大奖赛：谨防模仿。只要你给它一个公平的审判。我们玩得很开心。

Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there? Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum. No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.
来。我渴了。乌云密布。哪里都没有乌云吧？雷雨。奥尔布莱特他倒下了，智慧的骄傲闪电，路西法，迪科，qui nescit occasum。不，我的海蛤帽、手杖和他的凉鞋。在哪里？到傍晚的土地。夜晚自然会到来。

He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet. Già. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. Già. My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?
他握住梣木的剑柄，轻轻地刺来，一动不动地磨磨蹭蹭。是的，夜晚会在我身边，但在没有我的情况下。所有的日子都会结束。顺便说一句，接下来星期二什么时候将是最长的一天。母亲，在所有的新年快乐中，朗姆酒响起来。劳恩·丁尼生，绅士诗人。吉亚。对于那个黄牙老太婆。还有德鲁蒙先生，一位绅士记者。吉亚。我的牙齿非常不好。为什么，我想知道。感觉。那个也要去。贝壳。我想知道，我应该用这笔钱去看牙医吗？那个。这。无牙金奇，超人。我想知道为什么会这样，或者这可能意味着什么？

My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?
我的手帕。他把它扔了。我记得。我没拿起来吗？

His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn’t. Better buy one.
他的手在口袋里徒劳地摸索着。不，我没有。最好买一个。

He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully. For the rest let look who will.
他小心翼翼地将从鼻孔中挖出的干鼻涕放在一块岩石上。剩下的让我们看看谁会。

Behind. Perhaps there is someone.
在后面。也许有人。

He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.
他把脸转过肩膀，一副恭敬的样子。她的帆在空中移动，像三桅船一样高高的桅杆，在横梁上张开，自导自航，逆流而上，默默地移动，一艘沉默的船。

II

Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.
利奥波德·布鲁姆先生津津有味地吃着野兽和家禽的内脏。他喜欢浓浓的内脏汤、坚果胗、烤心、炸肝片、炸鳕鱼子。他最喜欢的是烤羊肾，这给他的味觉带来了淡淡的尿香。

Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a bit peckish.
当他轻轻地在厨房里走来走去，把她的早餐食品放在驼峰托盘上时，他心里想到的是肾脏。厨房里有明亮的光线和空气，但室外却到处都是温柔的夏日早晨。让他感觉有点饿了。

The coals were reddening.
煤块正在变红。

Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn’t like her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.
另一片面包和黄油：三，四：对。她不喜欢她的盘子满了。正确的。他从托盘上转过身来，把水壶从炉灶上拿起，侧放在火上。它呆呆地坐在那里，呆呆地蹲着，喷嘴伸出来。很快就喝杯茶了。好的。口干舌燥。猫高高地翘着尾巴，僵硬地绕着桌腿走着。

—Mkgnao!
——姆克瑙！

—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
——噢，你来了，布卢姆先生从火边转过身来说道。

The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my head. Prr.
猫喵喵地回应，然后又僵硬地绕着桌腿喵喵地走着。她是如何在我的写字台上悄悄走过的。呃。挠我的头。呃。

Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.
布卢姆先生好奇而友善地注视着这个柔软的黑色身影。清晰可见：她光滑的皮肤光泽，尾巴屁股下面的白色纽扣，绿色闪烁的眼睛。他向她弯下腰，双手放在膝盖上。

—Milk for the pussens, he said.
——给小猫喝牛奶，他说。

—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.
——Mrkgnao！猫哭了。

They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.
他们称他们为愚蠢的人。他们比我们更了解我们所说的话。她想明白的都明白了。也很记仇。残忍的。她的本性。好奇的老鼠从不尖叫。看来很喜欢啊想知道我在她眼中是什么样子。塔的高度？不，她可以跳我。

—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.
——害怕她是小鸡，他嘲讽地说。害怕小鸡。我从来没有见过像pussens这样愚蠢的pussens。

Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.
残忍的。她的本性。好奇的老鼠从不尖叫。看来很喜欢啊

—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
——Mrkrgnao！猫大声说道。

She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.
她因强烈的羞愧而眨了眨眼，闭上眼睛，哀怨地长长地喵喵叫，向他展示了她乳白色的牙齿。他看着她黑色的眼缝因贪婪而缩小，直到她的眼睛变成了绿色的宝石。然后他走到梳妆台前，拿起汉隆的送奶工刚刚为他倒满的水壶，将温热的牛奶倒在碟子上，然后慢慢地放在地板上。

—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
——咕噜！她哭着跑到腿上。

He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.
他看着她的鬃毛在微弱的光线下闪闪发光，她轻轻地舔了三下。想知道如果你剪掉它们，它们就无法鼠标跟随，这是真的吗？为什么？它们在黑暗中闪闪发光，也许是指尖。或者也许是黑暗中的触角。

He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley’s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.
他听着她舔腿的声音。火腿和鸡蛋，不。如此干旱，就没有好鸡蛋了。想要纯净的淡水。星期四：对于巴克利的羊肾来说也不是好日子。用黄油炒，胡椒粉摇匀。 Dlugacz’s 的猪肾更好。当水壶沸腾时。她放慢了速度，然后把碟子舔干净。为什么他们的舌头这么粗糙？为了更好地搭接，全是多孔孔。她什么都不能吃吗？他环顾四周。不。

On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
他踩着吱吱作响的靴子走上楼梯，来到大厅，在卧室门前停了下来。她可能喜欢吃好吃的东西。她早上喜欢吃薄面包和黄油。也许还是：偶尔一次。

He said softly in the bare hall:
他在空荡荡的大厅里轻声说道：

—I’m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
——我要绕过拐角处。一分钟后回来。

And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
当他听到自己的声音说出这句话时，他补充道：

—You don’t want anything for breakfast?
—你早餐不想吃什么吗？

A sleepy soft grunt answered:
一阵昏昏欲睡的轻哼声回答道：

—Mn.
——锰。

No. She didn’t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor’s auction. Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it. Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.
不，她什么都不想要。然后，当她翻身时，他听到一声温暖而沉重的叹息，声音越来越轻，床架上松动的黄铜环叮当作响。必须真正解决这些问题。遗憾。从直布罗陀一路过来。忘记了她所知道的一点西班牙语。不知道她父亲为此付出了什么。老式。是啊！当然。在州长拍卖会上买的。听到一声短促的敲门声。老特威迪，讨价还价时铁石心肠。是的先生。在普列夫纳就是这样。先生，我是从军中晋升的，我为此感到自豪。尽管如此，他还是有足够的头脑在邮票上创造这个角落。现在这是有远见的。

His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do. The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of paper. Quite safe.
他的手从挂着帽子的帽子上取下来，盖在他的厚大衣和失物招领处的二手防水外套上。邮票：粘性图片。敢说很多军官也参与其中。他们当然这样做。帽冠上汗水般的铭文无声地告诉他：普拉斯托的高品位哈。他快速地向皮革头带内部看了一眼。白色的纸条。相当安全。

On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come back anyhow.
在门口的台阶上，他在后袋里摸索钥匙。不在那里。在我留下的裤子里。一定要得到它。土豆我有。吱吱作响的衣柜。打扰她也没有用。那次她睡眼惺忪地翻了个身。他非常安静地拉门厅的门，甚至越来越小，直到门扉轻轻地落到门槛上，变成一个软乎乎的盖子。看着都关上了。好吧，无论如何，直到我回来。

He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church. Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn’t go in that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth. Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.
他走到明亮的一面，避开了七十五号松动的地窖门。太阳已经接近乔治教堂的尖塔了。我希望是一个温暖的日子。特别是在这些黑色的衣服上更有感觉。黑色传导、反射（是折射吗？）热量。但我不能穿着那套轻便的西装去。来一场野餐吧。当他走在幸福的温暖中时，他的眼皮常常悄悄地沉下去。博兰的面包车每天都会给我们送来托盘，但她更喜欢昨天的面包卷，脆冠热。让你感觉年轻。东方某处：清晨：黎明时分出发。在太阳面前走一圈，偷走他一天的路程。永远保持下去，技术上永远不会变老。沿着一条陌生的土地行走，来到一座城门前，那里有哨兵，也是老列兵，老特威迪的大胡子，拄着一根长长的矛。漫步穿过有遮篷的街道。戴着头巾的面孔走过。地毯店的黑暗洞穴里，大个子，可怕的图尔科，盘腿坐着，抽着盘管。街头小贩的叫卖声。喝带有茴香、果子露香味的水。一整天都有皮屑。可能会遇到一两个强盗。嗯，去见见他吧。继续赶着日落。清真寺柱子间的影子：牧师卷起卷轴。树木颤抖，这是晚风的信号。我继续。金色的天空渐渐褪色。一位母亲在门口看着我。她用孩子们的黑暗语言叫他们回家。高墙：琴弦之外。夜空，月亮，紫罗兰色，莫莉新吊袜带的颜色。字符串。听。一个女孩正在演奏其中一种乐器，你称之为扬琴。我通过。

Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the Freeman leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the north-west.
可能真的一点都不像。你读过的那种东西：在太阳的轨道上。扉页上有旭日图案。他微笑着，取悦自己。阿瑟·格里菲斯 (Arthur Griffith) 对弗里曼领袖头饰的评价是：一轮本土太阳从爱尔兰银行后面的巷道中从西北升起。他延长了满意的笑容。艾基触摸：主宰太阳从西北方升起。

He approached Larry O’Rourke’s. From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic. For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.
他走近拉里·奥洛克的家。松软的黑啤酒从地窖的栅栏里飘了出来。从敞开的门口，酒吧里散发出生姜、茶末和饼干糊的香味。然而，好房子：就在城市交通的尽头。例如，M’Auley 就在那里：n。 G。作为位置。当然，如果他们沿着北环线从牛市到码头运营一条有轨电车线路，价值就会猛涨。

Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I’m going to tell you? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.
百叶窗上的秃头。可爱的老家伙。向他拉拢广告是没有用的。但他仍然最了解自己的生意。果然，他就在那儿，我勇敢的拉里，穿着衬衫靠在糖箱上，看着围着围裙的副牧师用拖把和水桶擦拭。西蒙·迪达勒斯 (Simon Dedalus) 将他带上发球台，双眼紧闭。你知道我要告诉你什么吗？那是什么，奥罗克先生？你知道什么吗？对于俄罗斯人来说，它们只是日本人八点钟的早餐。

Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O’Rourke.
停下来说一句话：也许是关于葬礼的事。可怜的迪格南，奥罗克先生，这是一件令人悲伤的事。

Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:
拐进多塞特街时，他在门口新鲜地打招呼：

—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.
——美好的一天，奥罗克先生。

—Good day to you.
——祝你今天好。

—Lovely weather, sir.
——天气真好，先生。

—‘Tis all that.
——就是这样。

Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub. Save it they can’t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job, see?
他们从哪里得到钱？从莱特里姆县来的红发牧师正在地窖里冲洗空罐和老人。然后，你瞧，他们成长为 Adam Findlaters 或 Dan Tallons。然后就失去了竞争优势。一般口渴。好的谜题应该是穿过都柏林而不经过一家酒吧。他们不能保存它。也许远离酒鬼。放下三个，携带五个。那是什么，到处都是鲍勃，一点点。也许是批发订单。与镇上的旅客一起进行双重洗牌。把你和老板摆平，我们就分担工作，明白吗？

How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint Joseph’s National school. Brats’ clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.
这个月搬运工要花多少钱？说十桶东西。假设他有百分之十的折扣。噢，更多。十五。他通过了圣约瑟夫国立学校。臭小子的叫嚣。窗户打开。新鲜空气有助于记忆。或者轻快的。 Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou。他们是男孩吗？是的。伊尼什图克。伊尼沙克。伊尼什博芬。在他们的慢跑中。矿。斯利夫·布鲁姆。

He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.
他在德卢加茨的窗前停下来，盯着一串串香肠、马洛尼，黑白相间。十五乘以。那些数字在他的脑海中变白，无法解决：他不高兴，让它们消失了。闪亮的链节上塞满了肉，滋润着他的视线，他平静地呼吸着煮熟的辣猪血的微温气息。

A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and a half of Denny’s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.
柳条图案的盘子上有一颗肾脏渗出血迹：最后一个。他站在柜台旁边的邻家女孩身边。她也会买它，从她手里的纸条上调出这些物品吗？干裂：洗涤苏打。还有一磅半丹尼的香肠。他的目光停留在她充满活力的臀部上。他的名字叫伍兹。想知道他在做什么。老婆年纪大了。新鲜血液。不允许追随者。一双有力的手臂。在晾衣绳上敲打地毯。她确实打了它，乔治。她那弯曲的裙子在每次撞击时摆动的方式。

The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
雪眼猪肉屠夫把他用长满斑点的手指剪下来的香肠折起来，颜色是香肠粉红色。那里的肉健全：就像一头被圈养的小母牛。

He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.
他从一堆裁切纸中拿起一页：提比里亚湖畔基尼勒斯的模型农场。可成为理想的冬季疗养地。摩西·蒙蒂菲奥里。我以为他是。农舍，周围的墙壁，模糊的牛群耕作。他拿着那一页：有趣：仔细读一下，标题，模糊的牛群，书页沙沙作响。一头年轻的白色小母牛。牛市里的那些早晨，牲畜在围栏里低鸣，羊被打上烙印，粪便扑通扑通地掉下来，饲养员穿着平头钉靴子在垃圾中艰难前行，用手掌拍打熟透的后躯，手里拿着一个最好的，未剥皮的开关。 。他耐心地斜着书页，弯曲他的感官和意志，柔和的目光处于静止状态。歪歪扭扭的裙子摆动着，啪啪啪。

The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.
猪肉屠夫从堆里抓起两张，把她最好的香肠包起来，做了个红红的鬼脸。

—Now, my miss, he said.
——现在，我的小姐，他说。

She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.
她递出一枚硬币，大胆地微笑着，伸出粗壮的手腕。

—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?
——谢谢你，我的小姐。还有一先令三便士零钱。给你的，好吗？

Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the wood.
布卢姆先生迅速指着。如果她走得很慢，就追上她，走在她身后，跟在她移动的大腿后面。早上第一件事就是很高兴看到。快点啊，该死。趁着阳光明媚的时候准备干草。她站在阳光下的店外，懒洋洋地向右走去。他叹了口气：他们永远不明白。手被苏打水打湿了。脚趾甲也结痂了。布朗肩胛骨破烂不堪，从两方面保护着她。漠视的刺痛在他胸中燃烧成微弱的快乐。另一个例子是：一名下班的警察在埃克尔斯巷拥抱着她。他们喜欢它们很大。优质香肠。噢，警察先生，我在树林里迷路了。

—Threepence, please.
——请给我三份。

His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.
他的手接受了湿润的嫩腺，并将其滑入侧袋。然后它从他裤兜里掏出三枚硬币，放在橡胶刺上。它们躺着，被快速阅读，然后迅速地一盘接一盘地滑进收银台。

—Thank you, sir. Another time.
-谢谢你，先生。下一次。

A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.
狐眼中闪烁着一丝热切的火焰，向他表示感谢。片刻后他收回了目光。不：最好不要：下次再说。

—Good morning, he said, moving away.
——早上好，他说着就走开了。

—Good morning, sir.
-早上好先生。

No sign. Gone. What matter?
没有征兆。走了。有什么关系？

He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim: planters’ company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.
他沿着多塞特街往回走，一本正经地读书。 Agenth Netaim：种植者公司。从土耳其政府购买废弃沙地并种植桉树。非常适合遮阳、燃料和建筑。雅法以北的橘园和广阔的瓜田。你付八十马克，他们就会为你种植一德南的土地，种植橄榄、橙子、杏仁或香橼。橄榄更便宜：橙子需要人工灌溉。每年你都会收到农作物的寄来。您的名字将作为所有者永久记入工会名册中。可以支付十首付，余款每年分期付款。 Bleibtreustraße 34，柏林，西 15。

Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.
无所事事。背后仍然有一个想法。

He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade. And Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron’s basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn’t see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegian captain’s. Wonder if I’ll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.
他看着牛群，它们在银色的热浪中变得模糊。银粉橄榄树。安静的长日：修剪、成熟。橄榄装在罐子里，是吗？我还剩下一些来自安德鲁斯的。莫莉把它们吐了出来。现在知道它们的味道了。橙子用纸巾包装在板条箱中。香橼也是。奇怪的是可怜的香橼还在圣凯文的游行中。还有马斯蒂安斯基和旧琴。那时我们度过了愉快的夜晚。莫莉坐在 Citron 的篮子里。握起来很舒服，冰凉的蜡质果子，捧在手上，举到鼻孔处，闻着香味。就像那样，浓重、甜美、狂野的香水。年复一年，始终如一。莫伊泽尔告诉我，它们的价格也很高。杨梅之地：宜人街：宜人的旧时光。必须没有任何缺陷，他说。一路而来：西班牙、直布罗陀、地中海、黎凡特。板条箱在雅法的码头上一字排开，小伙子们在书上勾选它们，勤杂工穿着脏兮兮的工作服赤脚搬运它们。这就是你叫他出来的原因。你怎么？没看到。你认识的小伙子只是想向这个无聊的家伙致敬。他的背像挪威船长的背。不知道我今天能否见到他。浇水车。来惹雨。在地上如同在天上。

A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.
一朵云慢慢地、完全地遮住了太阳。灰色的。远的。

No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.
不，不是那样的。一片贫瘠的土地，光秃秃的荒地。火山湖，死海：没有鱼，没有杂草，沉入地下深处。没有风可以掀起那些波浪，灰色的金属，有毒的雾水。他们称其为硫磺雨：平原上的城市：所多玛、蛾摩拉、以东。皆死名。死亡之地中的死海，灰色而古老。现在老了。它承载着最古老、第一个种族。一个弯腰的女巫从卡西迪家走过来，脖子上抓着一个酒瓶。最年长的人。远远地走遍了整个地球，被囚禁到被囚禁，到处繁殖、死亡、诞生。它现在就躺在那儿。现在它再也承受不了了。死了：一个老妇人的：世界上灰色凹陷的阴户。

Desolation.
荒凉。

Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of the bed. Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises. On the hands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.
灰色的恐惧灼烧着他的肉体。他把那页纸折进口袋，拐进埃克尔斯街，匆匆回家。冰冷的油脂顺着他的血管滑过，让他的血液变冷：岁月给他披上了一层盐斗篷。嗯，我现在就在这里。是的，我现在在这里。早上嘴里有不好的形象。从床的另一边起身。必须重新开始那些桑多的练习。双手放下。有斑点的棕色砖房。八十号仍未出租。这是为什么？估值只有二十八。塔楼、巴特斯比、诺斯、麦克阿瑟：客厅的窗户上贴满了钞票。眼睛酸痛时贴膏药。闻茶的淡淡烟味、锅的烟味、嘶嘶作响的黄油味。靠近她那肥大的、温暖的肉体。是的是的。

Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.
温暖的阳光从伯克利路快速射来，穿着细长的凉鞋，沿着明亮的人行道快速奔跑。跑，她跑来迎接我，一个金色头发随风飘扬的女孩。

Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion.
大厅地板上放着两封信和一张卡片。他弯下腰​​把它们收集起来。马里恩·布鲁姆夫人。他原本加速的心跳一下子就慢了下来。大胆的手。马里恩夫人。

—Poldy!
——波尔迪！

Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.
走进卧室，他半闭上眼睛，穿过温暖的黄色暮色，走向她蓬乱的头。

—Who are the letters for?
——这些信是写给谁的？

He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.
他看着他们。穆林加尔。米莉.

—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a letter for you.
——米莉给我的一封信，他小心翼翼地说，还有一张给你的卡片。还有一封给你的信。

He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.
他把她的卡片和信放在靠近她膝盖弯曲处的斜纹布床罩上。

—Do you want the blind up?
——你想把百叶窗打开吗？

Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
他向后的眼睛轻轻地拉了一下百叶窗，看到她瞥了一眼那封信，然后把它塞到枕头底下。

—That do? he asked, turning.
——那样做？他转身问道。

She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
她正在用肘部支撑着看卡片。

—She got the things, she said.
——她得到了东西，她说。

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.
他等到她把卡片放在一边，舒舒服服地叹了口气，慢慢地蜷缩起来。

—Hurry up with that tea, she said. I’m parched.
——快点喝茶吧，她说。我口干舌燥。

—The kettle is boiling, he said.
——水壶正在沸腾，他说。

But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
但他迟迟没有清理椅子：她的条纹衬裙，扔掉的脏床单：然后将所有东西抱到床脚上。

As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
当他走下厨房楼梯时，她喊道：

—Poldy!
——波尔迪！

—What?
-什么？

—Scald the teapot.
——把茶壶烫一下。

On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won’t mouse. Say they won’t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
果然，沸腾了：从喷嘴中冒出一股蒸汽。他把茶壶烧烫并冲洗干净，放入四满勺茶，倾斜茶壶，让水流进去。把茶壶放好后，他取下茶壶，把茶壶压平在烧着的煤上，看着那团东西。黄油滑落并融化。当他打开肾脏时，猫对着他饥饿地喵喵叫。给她太多的肉，她就不会老鼠了。说他们不吃猪肉。犹太洁食。这里。他让沾满血迹的纸落到她身上，然后把腰子扔进滚烫的黄油酱中。胡椒。他用手指从有缺口的蛋杯中沿环形撒下蛋液。

Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls.
然后他撕开信，浏览了一页。谢谢： 新谭： 科格伦先生： 奥维尔湖野餐： 年轻学生： 布莱兹·博伊兰的海边女孩。

The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown
茶已经泡好了。他装满了自己的小胡子、假王冠

Derby, smiling. Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.
德比，微笑。傻米莉的生日礼物。那时她只有五岁。不，等等：四。我把她弄断的琥珀项链给了她。将折叠好的牛皮纸放入她的信箱中。他微笑着，倒了酒。

O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
噢，米莉·布鲁姆，你是我的宝贝。

You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
从早到晚你都是我的镜子。

I’d rather have you without a farthing
我宁愿你一文不值

Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.
比凯蒂·基奥（Katey Keogh）的屁股和花园还要多。

Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
可怜的古德温老教授。可怕的老案子。但他仍然是一个有礼貌的老伙计。他用老式的方式向莫莉鞠躬离开站台。还有他丝质帽子里的小镜子。那天晚上，米莉把它带进了客厅。哦，看看我在古德温教授的帽子里发现了什么！我们都笑了。即使在那时，性爱也爆发了。她真是个乖巧的小人物。

He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
他用叉子戳进腰子，然后把它拍翻：然后把茶壶放在托盘上。当他拿起它时，它的驼峰撞了一下。一切都在上面吗？面包和黄油，四个，糖，勺子，她的奶油。是的。他把茶壶拎到楼上，拇指勾在茶壶把手上。

Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.
他用膝盖推开门，把托盘端了进来，放在床头的椅子上。

—What a time you were! she said.
——那是多么美好的时光呀！她说。

She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.
她轻快地站起身来，手肘撑在枕头上，让铜管发出叮当作响的声音。他平静地低头看着她的大块头和她柔软的大奶子，睡衣里的奶子像母山羊的乳房一样倾斜。空气中弥漫着她躺着的身体的温暖，与她倒的茶香融为一体。

A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
一条撕破的信封从有凹痕的枕头下露出来。在走的过程中，他留下来整理床单。

—Who was the letter from? he asked.
——这封信是谁寄来的？他问。

Bold hand. Marion.
大胆的手。马里昂.

—O, Boylan, she said. He’s bringing the programme.
——哦，博伊兰，她说。他带来了节目。

—What are you singing?
——你在唱什么歌？

—La ci darem with J. C. Doyle, she said, and Love’s Old Sweet Song.
——J.C.道尔的《La cidarem》，她说，还有《Love's Old Sweet Song》。

Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day. Like foul flowerwater.
她丰满的嘴唇，喝着酒，微笑着。第二天香留下的相当陈旧的气味。就像污浊的花水一样。

—Would you like the window open a little?
——你想把窗户打开一点吗？

She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
她把一片面包对折放进嘴里，问道：

—What time is the funeral?
——葬礼几点举行？

—Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn’t see the paper.
——我想是十一点，他回答道。我没有看到报纸。

Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.
他顺着她的手指指点，从床上拿起她脏兮兮的抽屉腿。不？然后，一条扭曲的灰色吊袜带围绕着一只长袜：皱巴巴的、闪亮的鞋底。

—No: that book.
——不：那本书。

Other stocking. Her petticoat.
其他长袜。她的衬裙。

—It must have fell down, she said.
——它一定是掉下来了，她说。

He felt here and there. Voglio e non vorrei. Wonder if she pronounces that right: voglio. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.
他到处感觉。 Voglio e non vorrei。不知道她发音是否正确：voglio。不在床上。一定是滑下去了。他弯下腰​​，掀起帷幔。这本书掉了下来，摊开在橙色钥匙夜壶的凸起部分上。

—Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There’s a word I wanted to ask you.
——在这儿展示，她说。我在里面做了标记。有一句话我想问你。

She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.
她从没有把手的杯子里喝了一口茶，然后用指尖在毯子上巧妙地擦拭了一下，开始用发夹搜索文字，直到找到那个词。

—Met him what? he asked.
——遇见他什么？他问。

—Here, she said. What does that mean?
——在这里，她说。这意味着什么？

He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.
他俯身在她抛光的缩略图附近阅读。

—Metempsychosis?
-轮回？

—Yes. Who’s he when he’s at home?
-是的。当他在家时他是谁？

—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.
——轮回，他皱着眉头说道。这是希腊语：来自希腊语。这意味着灵魂的转世。

—O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.
——噢，真棒！她说。用简单的话告诉我们。

He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes. The first night after the charades. Dolphin’s Barn. He turned over the smudged pages. Ruby: the Pride of the Ring. Hello. Illustration. Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked. Sheet kindly lent. The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at Hengler’s. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and we’ll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man’s soul after he dies. Dignam’s soul …
他微笑着，斜视着她嘲讽的眼睛。同样年轻的眼睛。猜谜游戏后的第一个晚上。海豚谷仓。他翻开了污迹斑斑的书页。红宝石：戒指的骄傲。你好。插图。凶猛的意大利人，用马车鞭子。一定是赤裸裸地躺在地板上的鲁比的骄傲。好心借给床单。怪物马菲停止了脚步，并发誓地把他的受害者从他身上扔了出去。这一切的背后都是残酷。给动物注射兴奋剂。亨格勒餐厅的空中飞人。不得不另眼相看。暴民目瞪口呆。折断你的脖子，我们就会折断我们的身体。他们的家人。让他们年轻，这样他们就可以重生。我们死后还活着。我们的心灵。人死后的灵魂。迪格纳姆的灵魂……

—Did you finish it? he asked.
——你做完了吗？他问。

—Yes, she said. There’s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?
——是的，她说。里面没有什么肮脏的东西。难道她一直都爱着第一个男人？

—Never read it. Do you want another?
——从来没有读过它。你还想要另一个吗？

—Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Nice name he has.
-是的。再买一份保罗·德科克的。他的名字很好听。

She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.
她又往杯子里倒了一些茶，看着茶从旁边流过。

Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that’s the word.
必须更新卡佩尔街图书馆的书，否则他们会写信给我的担保人科尔尼。转世：就是这个词。

—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.
——他说，有些人相信，我们死后会继续生活在另一个身体里，我们以前生活过。他们称之为转世。我们都曾在数千年前的地球或其他星球上生活过。他们说我们已经忘记了。有人说他们记得自己的前世。

The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Bette remind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?
缓慢凝结的奶油在她的茶中盘旋。贝蒂提醒她这个词：轮回。举个例子就更好了。一个例子？

The Bath of the Nymph over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of Photo Bits: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.
床上方的仙女之浴。赠送复活节照片位：艺术色彩的辉煌杰作。喝牛奶之前先喝茶。和她头发披下来的时候没什么两样：更苗条。我为框架给出了三和六。她说把它放在床上会很好看。裸体仙女：希腊：例如当时生活的所有人。

He turned the pages back.
他把书页翻了回去。

—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. What they called nymphs, for example.
——他说，古希腊人称之为轮回。例如，他们曾经相信你可以变成动物或树。例如，他们称之为若虫。

Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.
她的勺子不再搅拌糖了。她直视前方，用拱形鼻孔吸气。

—There’s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?
——有一股烧焦的味道，她说。你在火上留下了什么东西吗？

—The kidney! he cried suddenly.
——肾脏！他突然哭了。

He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.
他把书粗鲁地塞进内袋，脚趾撞到了坏掉的马桶，急忙朝气味传来的地方跑去，像一只惊慌的鹳鸟腿一样匆匆走下楼梯。刺鼻的烟雾从锅的一侧喷射出来。他用叉子的尖头戳肾下方，把肾拆下来，然后把它翻成乌龟背朝天的样子。只是有点烧焦了。他把它从锅里扔到盘子上，让少量的棕色肉汁滴在上面。

Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.
现在喝杯茶。他坐下来，切下一片面包并涂上黄油。他把烧焦的肉放在岸上，扔给猫。然后他把叉子放进嘴里，用洞察力咀嚼着美味柔韧的肉。完成一个回合。喝了一口茶。然后他切下一片面包，将其中一块沾上肉汁，放进嘴里。某个年轻学生和一次野餐是怎么回事？他把放在身边的信折起来，一边咀嚼一边慢慢地读着，又把另一片面包浸在肉汁里，然后把它举到嘴边。

 Dearest Papli
最亲爱的帕普利

Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy’s Iovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano downstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday. There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls. Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest love
非常感谢你送来的这份可爱的生日礼物。它非常适合我。每个人都说我是我的新助理中的美女。我收到了妈妈的一盒可爱的面霜，正在写信。他们很可爱。我现在正涉足摄影行业。科格伦先生给我拍了一张，威尔夫人在冲洗后寄给我。昨天我们生意很好。美好的一天，所有的牛肉都在。周一我们将和几个朋友一起去奥威尔湖去野餐。给妈妈和你自己一个大大的吻和感谢，表达我的爱。我在楼下的钢琴上听到他们的声音。周六将在 Greville Arms 举办一场音乐会。有一个年轻的学生有时晚上会来这里，名叫班农（Bannon），他的表兄弟或其他什么大人物，他唱博伊兰（我当时正在写布莱兹·博伊兰的流行歌曲）关于那些海边女孩的歌曲。告诉他愚蠢的米莉向他致以最诚挚的敬意。我现在必须以最深挚的爱来结束

Your fond daughter, MILLY.
你最爱的女儿，米莉。

P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby. M.
P.S.请原谅我写得不好，我很着急。拜拜。 M。

Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.
昨天十五。好奇，也是十五号。她离开家的第一个生日。分离。还记得她出生的那个夏天早晨，她跑去登齐尔街去撞桑顿太太。快活的老妇人。她一定帮助了很多婴儿来到这个世界。她从一开始就知道可怜的小鲁迪活不下去了。嗯，上帝是良善的，先生。她立刻就知道了。如果他还活着的话，他现在已经十一岁了。

His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing. Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the XL Cafe about the bracelet. Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look. Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.
他一脸茫然，怜悯地看着附言。写得不好请见谅。匆忙。楼下有钢琴。从她的壳里出来了。在 XL 咖啡厅与她争论手镯的问题。不吃她的蛋糕，也不说话，也不看她。冒失鬼。他把其他的面包片浸在肉汁里，然后一块一块地吃肾。每周十二点和六点。不多。不过，她可能会做得更糟。音乐厅舞台。年轻的学生。他喝了一杯凉茶来冲下饭菜。然后他又读了一遍这封信：读了两遍。

O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild piece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now.
哦，好吧：她知道如何照顾自己。但如果没有呢？不，什么也没发生。当然可能。无论如何都要等到它出现为止。一件野生货。她纤细的双腿跑上楼梯。命运。现在正在成熟。

Vain: very.
虚：非常。

He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little. Was given milk too long. On the ERIN’S KING that day round the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.
他对着厨房的窗户露出苦恼的微笑。有一天，我在街上看到她捏着脸颊，让它们变得通红。有点贫血。喝奶时间太长了。那天在基什河周围的“ERIN’S KING”上。该死的旧浴缸到处乱晃。一点也不时髦。淡蓝色的围巾随着头发随风飘扬。

All dimpled cheeks and curls,
满是酒窝的脸颊和卷发，

Your head it simply swirls.
你的头只是在旋转。

Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says. Pier with lamps, summer evening, band,
海边的姑娘们。撕破的信封。双手插在裤兜里，一边唱歌一边休息一天。家人的朋友。漩涡，他说。有灯的码头，夏日的夜晚，乐队，

Those girls, those girls,
那些女孩，那些女孩，

Those lovely seaside girls.
那些可爱的海边女孩。

Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.
米莉也是。年轻的吻：第一次。现在已经过去很远了。马里恩夫人。一边读书，一边躺着，数着自己的头发，微笑着，编着辫子。

A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can’t move. Girl’s sweet light lips. Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman’s lips.
一种轻微的不安、悔恨顺着他的脊梁流下来，越来越强烈。会发生，是的。防止。无用：不能移动。少女甜美轻薄的双唇。也会发生。他感到一股不安的感觉蔓延到全身。现在动也没什么用了。嘴唇亲吻，亲吻，亲吻。女人的嘴唇充满胶水。

Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M’Coy.
她在下面的地方更好：离开。占领她。想养只狗来打发时间。可能会去那里旅行。八月银行假期，只有两人和六人返程。不过，请假六周。可能会获得记者通行证。或者通过 M'Coy。

The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.
猫把身上的皮毛都清理干净后，又回到沾满肉的纸上，用鼻子嗅了嗅，然后大步向门口走去。她回头看着他，喵了一声。想出去。在门前等待，有时它会打开。让她等一下。有坐立不安。电的。空中雷声四起。她也背对着火洗耳朵。

He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.
他感到沉重、饱腹，然后肠子轻轻地松弛下来。他站起身来，解开了裤腰带。猫对他喵喵叫。

—Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I’m ready.
-咪！他回答道。等我准备好了。

Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.
沉重：炎热的一天即将到来。爬楼梯到平台太麻烦了。

A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as I’m.
一篇论文。他喜欢坐在凳子上看书。希望没有猿猴像我一样来敲门。

In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits. He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.
他在抽屉里找到了一批旧的《花絮》。他把它夹在腋下，走到门边打开门。猫轻轻地跳了起来。啊，想上楼，在床上蜷成一团。

Listening, he heard her voice:
侧耳倾听，他听到了她的声音：

—Come, come, pussy. Come.
——来吧，来吧，小猫。来。

He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.
他从后门走进花园：站着聆听下一个花园的声音。没有声音。也许把衣服挂起来晾干。女仆正在花园里。早上好。

He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies’ kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.
他弯下腰​​，注视着墙边生长的一排稀疏的留兰香。在这里建一个避暑别墅。猩红色的赛跑者。弗吉尼亚爬行者。想要把整个地方都施肥，结痂的土壤。一层硫磺肝脏。所有的土壤都像这样没有粪便。家用污水。洛姆，这是什么？隔壁花园里的母鸡：它们的粪便是很好的追肥。最棒的是牛，尤其是当它们吃这些油饼时。粪便覆盖物。清洁女士小山羊皮手套的最佳方法。肮脏的清洁。灰烬也。夺回整个地方。在那个角落里种豌豆。莴苣。那就永远吃新鲜的蔬菜。尽管如此，花园也有其缺点。圣灵降临节这里的蜜蜂或蓝蝇。

He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don’t remember that. Hallstand too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters. Drago’s shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say. O’Brien.
他继续往前走。顺便问一下，我的帽子在哪里？一定是把它放回了钉子上。或者挂在地板上。有趣的是我不记得了。门厅太满了。四把雨伞，她的雨衣。捡起字母。德拉戈的店铃响了。奇怪的是，我当时只是在想。亮丽的棕色头发披在衣领上。刚刚洗了个澡，刷了一遍。不知道我今天早上有时间洗澡吗？塔拉街。他们说，那里的收银员偷走了詹姆斯·斯蒂芬斯。奥布莱恩。

Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss. Enthusiast.
德卢加茨的声音低沉。议程是什么？现在，我的小姐。爱好者。

He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his countinghouse. Nobody.
他踢开了杰克那扇疯狂的门。最好小心别在葬礼上弄脏这条裤子。他走进去，在低矮的门楣下低下了头。他把门半开着，在发霉的石灰水和陈腐的蜘蛛网的恶臭中解开了牙套。坐下之前，他透过缝隙看了看隔壁的窗户。国王在他的帐房里。没有人。

Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a bit. Our prize titbit: Matcham’s Masterstroke. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.
他蹲在高凳上，展开报纸，在裸露的膝盖上翻阅。一些新的和简单的东西。不用太着急。保留一点。我们的奖品花絮：Matcham 的绝妙一击。由伦敦 Playgoers’ Club 的 Philip Beaufoy 先生撰写。已按每专栏一几尼的价格向作者付款。三个半。三磅三。三磅，十三磅又六磅。

Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it’s not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.
他克制自己，静静地读第一栏，屈服但抗拒，开始读第二栏。中途，他最后的抵抗屈服了，他一边读着，一边让肠胃安静下来，仍然耐心地读着，昨天的轻微便秘已经消失了。希望它不会太大，再次带来一堆。不，刚刚好。所以。啊!成本高昂。一份关于鼠李皮的小报。生活也许就是这样。它没有移动或接触他，但它是快速而整洁的。现在打印任何东西。愚蠢的季节。他继续读下去，平静地坐着，忽略了自己升起的气味。当然很整洁。马查姆经常想起他赢得了现在的笑女巫的绝招。以道德开始和结束。手牵手。聪明的。他回头浏览了一遍读过的内容，一边感受着自己的水静静地流淌，一边羡慕博福伊先生写了这本书，并收到了三英镑十三零六英镑的报酬。

Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I’m swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.
可能会画一个草图。作者：L.M. Bloom 先生和夫人。为一些谚语编一个故事。哪个？有一次我试着在袖口上记下她说的穿衣之道。不喜欢一起穿衣服。刮胡子的时候把自己划伤了。咬着下唇，勾住了裙摆。给她计时。 9.l5.罗伯茨付钱给你了吗？ 9.20。格蕾塔·康罗伊 (Gretta Conroy) 穿什么衣服？ 9.23。是什么让我买了这把梳子？ 9.24。吃完那卷白菜我就肿了。她靴子的漆皮上有一粒灰尘。

Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn’t pan out somehow.
巧妙地轮流在她穿着袜子的小腿上摩擦每条伤痕。早上，集市舞会结束后，梅的乐队演奏了庞基耶利的《时辰之舞》。解释一下：早上，中午，然后是晚上，然后是晚上。洗牙。那是第一个晚上。她的头在跳舞。她的粉丝棒咔哒作响。那个博伊兰过得好吗？他有钱。为什么？我注意到他跳舞时呼吸着一股浓郁的气味。那就哼哼也没用了。暗示一下吧。昨晚的音乐很奇怪。镜子处于阴影之中。她用羊毛背心上的手镜轻快地摩擦着摇摇晃晃的小宝宝。凝视着它。她的眼里有皱纹。无论如何，它不会成功。

Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.
傍晚时分，穿着灰纱的女孩。然后是夜间：带着匕首和眼罩的黑色。诗意：粉色，然后金色，然后灰色，然后黑色。尽管如此，也栩栩如生。白天：然后是晚上。

He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.
他猛地撕下一半的获奖故事，并用它擦了擦自己。然后他束起裤带，撑起身子，扣上纽扣。他拉开杰克摇摇欲坠的门，从黑暗中来到空中。

In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
在明亮的灯光下，四肢变得轻盈而凉爽，他仔细地审视着自己的黑色裤子：裤脚、膝盖、膝盖的前部。葬礼几点举行？最好在报纸上找到答案。

A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George’s church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.
高空中传来嘎吱声和黑暗的呼呼声。乔治教堂的钟声。他们报时：响亮的黑铁声。

Heigho! Heigho!
嘿嘿！嘿嘿！

Heigho! Heigho!
嘿嘿！嘿嘿！

Heigho! Heigho!
嘿嘿！嘿嘿！

Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.
差一刻。又是：空气中传来的泛音，第三声。

Poor Dignam!
可怜的迪格纳姆！

By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors’ home. He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow. O let him! His life isn’t such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da. Slack hour: won’t be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past Nichols’ the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s. Singing with his eyes shut. Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.
布卢姆先生乘着卡车，沿着约翰·罗杰森爵士的码头，清醒地走着，经过风车巷、利斯克的亚麻籽压榨机、邮政电报局。也可以给出那个地址。还经过了水手的家。他从码头边清晨的喧嚣中转过身，穿过莱姆街。在布雷迪的小屋旁，一个要剥皮的男孩懒洋洋地躺着，他的一桶内脏连在一起，抽着嚼过的烟蒂。一个额头上有湿疹疤痕的小女孩看着他，无精打采地拿着她破烂的木桶。告诉他，如果他抽烟，他就不会成长。噢，让他吧！他的生活并不称心如意。在酒吧外面等着带爸爸回家。回家见妈妈，爸爸。闲暇时间：那里不会有很多。他穿过汤森街，经过伯特利皱着眉头的脸。 El，是的：房子：阿莱夫，贝丝。再过尼科尔斯的殡葬承办人。十一点了。时间够了。达雷赛·科尼·凯莱赫 (Daresay Corny Kelleher) 为奥尼尔赢得了这份工作。闭着眼睛唱歌。陈词滥调。有一次在公园遇见她。在黑暗中。真是个百灵鸟啊。警察兜售。然后她告诉我她的名字和地址。哦，他肯定把它装进了袋子里。把他便宜地埋在一个你可以称之为的地方。和我的 tooraloom，tooraloom，tooraloom，tooraloom。

In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan. Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
在韦斯特兰街，他在贝尔法斯特和东方茶叶公司的橱窗前停下来，读着铅纸包装的传说：精选混合茶、最优质的茶、家庭茶。比较温暖。茶。必须从汤姆·克南那里得到一些。不过，不能在葬礼上问他。当他的眼睛仍然温和地阅读时，他静静地摘下帽子，吸入发油，然后将右手缓慢而优雅地抚过额头和头发。非常温暖的早晨。在他们垂下的眼睑下，他的眼睛发现了他的高级帽子里的皮革发带上的小蝴蝶结。就在那里。他的右手伸进了帽子的碗里。他的手指很快在发带后面找到了一张卡片，然后将其放入背心口袋中。

So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente, not doing a hand’s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It’s a law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.
如此温暖。他的右手再次缓慢地抚过他的额头和头发。然后他再次戴上帽子，松了口气：并再次阅读：精选混合物，由最好的锡兰品牌制成。远东。这一定是一个可爱的地方：世界花园，漂浮着的大叶子，仙人掌，花香的蜂蜜酒，他们称之为蛇形藤本植物。奇怪是这样的吗？那些辛加拉人在阳光下悠闲地闲逛，一整天都不干活。十二个月中有六个月睡觉。太热了，不想吵架。气候的影响。昏睡。闲散之花。空气供给最多。氮族。植物园里的温室。敏感植物。睡莲。花瓣太累了。空气中弥漫着昏睡病。走在玫瑰叶上。想象一下尝试吃牛肚和牛车。我在那张照片中看到的那个人在哪里？啊，是的，在死海中仰面漂浮，撑着阳伞看书。如果你尝试的话也不会沉下去：盐太厚了。因为水的重量，不，身体在水中的重量等于什么的重量？还是体积等于重量？这是一条类似的法律。万斯在高中教书时手指关节骨折。大学课程。破解课程。当你说重量时，重量到底是什么？每秒三十二英尺。落体定律：每秒每秒。他们都倒在了地上。地球。地球引力就是重量。

He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded Freeman from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.
他转身走开，漫步穿过马路。她是怎么带着香肠走路的？就像那样的东西。当他走路时，他从侧袋里拿出折叠好的弗里曼，展开它，用警棍纵向卷起来，每走一步都用它敲击裤腿。粗心空气：顺便过来看看。每秒每秒。 Per Second 就是每秒的意思。他从路边石上敏锐地瞥了一眼邮局的门。太迟了盒子。在这里发帖。没有人。在。

He handed the card through the brass grill.
他把卡片从黄铜烤架上递了过去。

—Are there any letters for me? he asked.
——有给我的信吗？他问。

While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time.
当邮局局长在档案箱里搜寻时，他凝视着征兵海报，上面画着各兵种的士兵正在游行：他把警棍尖抵在鼻孔上，闻到了新印的抹布纸的味道。可能没有答案。上次走得太远了。

The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.
邮局局长通过烤架将附有一封信的卡片递给他。他向她道了谢，然后快速地扫了一眼打印出来的信封。

Henry Flower Esq,
亨利·弗劳尔先生，

c/o P. O. Westland Row,
c/o P.O. Westland Row，

City.
城市。

Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment? Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he’s a grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith’s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King’s own. Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.
无论如何都回答了。他把卡片和信塞进侧袋，再次检阅了阅兵式上的士兵。老特威迪的团在哪里？被抛弃的士兵。那里：熊皮帽和鬃毛羽毛。不，他是一名掷弹兵。尖头袖口。他就在那里：都柏林皇家燧发枪手。红衣。太艳丽了。这一定就是女人追求他们的原因。制服。更容易入伍和训练。莫德·冈（Maud Gonne）关于晚上带他们离开奥康奈尔街的信：这是我们爱尔兰首都的耻辱。格里菲斯的论文现在也采取了同样的策略：一支因性病而腐烂的军队：海外或半海外帝国。他们看起来半生不熟：就像被催眠了一样。向前看。标记时间。表：能。床：编辑。国王自己的。永远不要看到他打扮成消防员或鲍比。石匠，是的。

He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.
他漫步走出邮局，向右转。谈话：好像这样就能解决问题。他的手伸进口袋，食指伸进信封的封口下，猛地把它撕开。我不认为女性会非常注意。他的手指抽出那封信，将信封揉皱在口袋里。有固定的东西：也许是照片。头发？不。

M’Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when you.
麦科伊。赶紧摆脱他吧。带我离开我的道路。讨厌陪伴的时候。

—Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
——你好，布鲁姆。你要去哪里？

—Hello, M’Coy. Nowhere in particular.
——你好，麦科伊。无处特别。

—How’s the body?
——身体怎么样？

—Fine. How are you?
-美好的。你好吗？

—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.
——只是为了活下去，麦考伊说。

His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
他的目光落在黑色领带和衣服上，低声问道：

—Is there any … no trouble I hope? I see you’re …
——有什么……我希望没有麻烦吗？我看你是……

—O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
——哦，不，布卢姆先生说。可怜的迪格纳姆，你知道的。葬礼就在今天。

—To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
——确实如此，可怜的家伙。确实如此。什么时候？

A photo it isn’t. A badge maybe.
它不是一张照片。也许是徽章。

—E … eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
——十一点，布卢姆先生回答。

—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?
——我必须设法出去，麦考伊说。十一，是吗？我昨晚才听到。谁告诉我的？霍洛汉。你认识霍皮吗？

—I know.
-我知道。

Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch out of her.
布卢姆先生凝视着马路对面的格罗夫纳酒店门前的外来者。搬运工把箱子搬到井上。她一动不动地站着，等待着，而那个男人、丈夫、兄弟，就像她一样，在口袋里寻找零钱。时尚的卷领外套，在这样的日子里很温暖，看起来像毯子。她双手插在贴袋里，漫不经心地站着。就像马球比赛中那个傲慢的生物一样。女人都支持种姓，直到你触及到这一点。帅是帅，帅也是帅。保留即将屈服。尊敬的夫人和布鲁图斯是一位值得尊敬的人。占有她一次，把她身上的淀粉去掉。

—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway’s we were.
——我和鲍勃·多兰在一起，他正在周期性转弯，你怎么称呼他“班塔姆·里昂”呢？我们就在康威那里。

Doran Lyons in Conway’s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady’s hand. Which side will she get up?
康威餐厅的多兰·莱昂斯。她举起戴着手套的手捂住头发。霍皮进来了。有湿气。他向后仰起头，从蒙着眼睑的地方远远望去，他看到了明亮的小鹿皮在强光下闪闪发光，还有编成辫子的鼓。今天我显然可以看到。水分也许能带来远见。谈论一件事或另一件事。女士的手。她会站在哪一​​边？

—And he said: Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? I said. Poor little Paddy Dignam, he said.
——他说：我们可怜的朋友帕迪真是令人难过！什么稻田？我说。可怜的小帕迪·迪格纳姆，他说。

Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for? Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings to her bow.
去乡下：可能是布罗德斯通。棕色高筒靴，鞋带悬垂。足转得好。他推动这一变革的目的是什么？看见我在看。时刻留意其他人。好的后备。她的弓上有两根弦。

—Why? I said. What’s wrong with him? I said.
-为什么？我说。他究竟怎么了？我说。

Proud: rich: silk stockings.
骄傲：富有：丝袜。

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
——是的，布鲁姆先生说。

He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head. Getting up in a minute.
他稍微移到了麦考伊说话的脑袋旁边。一分钟后就起来了。

—What’s wrong with him? He said. He’s dead, he said. And, faith, he filled up. Is it Paddy Dignam? I said. I couldn’t believe it when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch. Yes, he said. He’s gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow. Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!
-他究竟怎么了？他说。他死了，他说。而且，信心，他充满了。是帕迪·迪格纳姆吗？我说。当我听到时我简直不敢相信。我不迟于上周五或周四在拱门与他在一起。是的，他说。他走了。他周一去世了，可怜的家伙。手表！手表！丝质闪富丝袜白色。手表！

A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.
一辆沉重的有轨电车鸣着锣声在中间行驶。

Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the display of. esprit de corps. Well, what are you gaping at?
失去了它。诅咒你那吵闹的哈巴狗。感觉被锁在外面了。天堂和周边。总是这样发生。那一刻。周一，尤斯塔斯街走廊里的女孩正在整理她的吊袜带。她的朋友覆盖了展示。团队精神好吧，你目瞪口呆做什么？

—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
——是的，是的，布卢姆先生沉闷地叹了口气后说道。另一个消失了。

—One of the best, M’Coy said.
——最好的之一，麦考伊说。

The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.
电车过去了。他们驶向环线桥，她戴着手套的那只肥硕的手放在钢把手上。闪烁，闪烁：阳光下她帽子的蕾丝花边：闪烁，闪烁。

—Wife well, I suppose? M’Coy’s changed voice said.
——我想，妻子还好吗？麦考伊变了声音说道。

—O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
——哦，是的，布卢姆先生说。顶顶，谢谢。

He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
他懒洋洋地展开报纸接力棒，懒洋洋地读道：

What is home without
家没有什么

Plumtree’s Potted Meat?
Plumtree 的盆栽肉？

Incomplete
不完整

With it an abode of bliss.
有了它，就有了幸福的居所。

—My missus has just got an engagement. At least it’s not settled yet.
——我的夫人刚刚订婚。至少现在还没有定下来。

Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I’m off that, thanks.
再次提箱。顺便说一下没有坏处。我不再那样了，谢谢。

Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.
布卢姆先生睁着大眼皮，眼神里充满了不慌不忙的友善。

—My wife too, he said. She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth.
——我的妻子也是，他说。她将于二十五日在贝尔法斯特阿尔斯特音乐厅举行的一场盛大的活动中演唱。

—That so? M’Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who’s getting it up?
-这么？麦考伊说。很高兴听到这个消息，老人。谁来解决这个问题？

Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.
马里恩·布鲁姆夫人。还没起来呢女王在她的卧室里吃着面包。没有书。熏黑的法庭牌七七八八地放在她的大腿上。黑皮肤的女士和白皮肤的男人。信。猫毛茸茸的黑球。撕破的信封条。

Love’s
爱的

Old
老的

Sweet
甜的

Song
歌曲

Comes lo-ove’s old …
爱已经老了……

—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully. Sweeeet song. There’s a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.
——这是一种旅行，你明白吗，布鲁姆先生若有所思地说。甜蜜的歌。成立了一个委员会。部分股份，部分利润。

M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.
麦考伊点点头，剔着胡子茬。

—O, well, he said. That’s good news.
——哦，好吧，他说。那是好消息。

He moved to go.
他动身要走。

—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.
——嗯，很高兴看到你看起来很健康，他说。遇见你敲门。

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
——是的，布鲁姆先生说。

—Tell you what, M’Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see. There’s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if I’m not there, will you?
——告诉你吧，麦考伊说。你可以在葬礼上记下我的名字，可以吗？我想去，但我可能去不了，你看。桑迪科夫可能会出现溺水案，如果尸体被发现，验尸官和我就必须下去。如果我不在的话你就直接塞我的名字吧？

—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That’ll be all right.
——我会这么做的，布鲁姆先生说着就要下车。这样就可以了。

—Right, M’Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I’d go if I possibly could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M’Coy will do.
——好吧，麦考伊爽朗地说。谢谢，老头。如果可以的话我会去。嗯，收费站。只要 C. P. M’Coy 就可以了。

—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
——一定会做到的，布鲁姆先生坚定地回答。

Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.
没发现我打瞌睡时发出的喘息声。快速的触摸。软标记。我想要我的工作。我特别喜欢旅行箱。皮革。封角、铆接边缘、双作用杠杆锁。鲍勃·考利（Bob Cowley）去年将他的威克洛帆船赛音乐会借给了他，但从那个美好的日子到现在，再也没有听到过任何消息。

Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don’t you know: in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can’t he hear the difference? Think he’s that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse. Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.
布鲁姆先生漫步走向不伦瑞克街，微笑着。我的太太刚刚得到了一个。芦苇雀斑女高音。奶酪切鼻子。就其方式来说已经足够好了：一首小民谣。没有胆量在里面。你和我，难道你不知道：同舟共济吗？软皂洗。给你一根针就可以了。他听不出区别吗？我认为他有点那样的倾向。不知何故违背了我的原则。我以为贝尔法斯特会来接他。我希望那里的天花不要变得更糟。假设她不再让自己接种疫苗。你的妻子和我的妻子。

Wonder is he pimping after me?
奇怪他是不是在追我？

Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery’s Summer Sale. No, he’s going on straight. Hello. Leah tonight. Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Like to see her again in that. Hamlet she played last night. Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.
布卢姆先生站在拐角处，目光在五彩斑斓的围墙上徘徊。坎特雷尔和科克伦的姜汁汽水（芳香）。克莱里的夏季特卖。不，他要直接走。你好。今晚莉亚。班德曼·帕尔默夫人。喜欢再次见到她。她昨晚扮演哈姆雷特。男性模仿者。也许他是个女人。奥菲莉亚为何自杀？可怜的爸爸！他过去常在其中谈论凯特·贝特曼。在伦敦的阿德尔菲酒店外面，我们等了整个下午才进去。我出生的前一年是：六十五岁。还有维也纳的里斯托里。这个正确的名字是什么？莫森塔尔确实如此。雷切尔，是吗？不。他经常谈论的场景是，老盲人亚伯拉罕认出了这个声音，并将手指放在他的脸上。

Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.
是内森的声音！他儿子的声音！我听到内森的声音，他离开了他父亲，在我怀里死于悲伤和痛苦，他离开了他父亲的家，离开了他父亲的上帝。

Every word is so deep, Leopold.
每个词都那么深刻，利奥波德。

Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.
可怜的爸爸！悲惨的人！我很高兴我没有进房间看他的脸。那天！噢，亲爱的！噢，亲爱的！噗！好吧，也许这对他来说是最好的。

Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow.
布卢姆先生绕过拐角，越过了危险区低垂的马匹。再想也没有用。鼻袋时间。真希望我没有遇到那个麦考伊家伙。

He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.
他走近了一些，听到了镀金燕麦的嘎吱声和牙齿轻轻咬合的声音。当他走过时，在马尿的甜燕麦味中，他们用圆圆的雄鹿眼睛注视着他。他们的黄金国。可怜的家伙们！该死的，他们的长鼻子卡在鼻袋里，只知道或关心任何事情。言语太丰富了。但它们的饲料和睡眠仍然正常。也被阉割了：一截黑色古塔胶在他们的臀部之间软弱地摇晃着。这样也许还是会很幸福吧。他们看起来好可怜。但它们的嘶鸣声仍然非常令人恼火。

He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
他从口袋里掏出信，把它折进随身携带的报纸里。可能就在这里走进她。车道比较安全。

He passed the cabman’s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies. All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. Voglio e non. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying syllables as they pass. He hummed:
他经过马车夫的避难所。好奇漂流出租车司机的生活。所有天气、所有地点、时间或地点，不以自己的意志为转移。沃利奥和非。喜欢给他们一支奇怪的香烟。善于交际。当他们经过时，喊出几个飞音节。他哼了一声：

La ci darem la mano
拉西达雷姆拉马诺

La la lala la la.
啦啦啦啦啦。

He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade’s timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it. And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s school. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis’s. And Mr? He opened the letter within the newspaper.
他拐进坎伯兰街，走了几步，在车站墙的背风处停了下来。没有人。米德的木材场。堆积的障碍。废墟和公寓。他小心翼翼地走过一个跳房子的场地，里面有被遗忘的镐石。不是罪人。在木材场附近，一个孩子蹲在弹子球上，独自一人，用拇指射击弹子。一只聪明的虎斑猫，一只眨眼的狮身人面像，在她温暖的窗台上注视着。可惜打扰了他们。穆罕默德从斗篷上剪下一块，以免吵醒她。打开它。有一次，我去那位老太太的学校时玩弹子球。她喜欢木犀草。埃利斯夫人的。先生呢？他在报纸上打开了这封信。

A flower. I think it’s a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not annoyed then? What does she say?
一朵花。我认为这是一个。一朵黄色的花，花瓣扁平。那不生气吗？她说了什么？

Dear Henry
亲爱的亨利

I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and write by return to your longing
我收到了你给我的最后一封信，非常感谢你。很抱歉您不喜欢我的上一封信。你为什么附上邮票？我对你非常生气。我真希望我能为此惩罚你。我叫你顽皮的孩子，因为我不喜欢那个世界。请告诉我这个词的真正含义是什么？你这个可怜的小淘气男孩，你在家里不开心吗？我真希望能为你做点什么。请告诉我你对可怜的我有何看法。我经常想起你的美丽名字。亲爱的亨利，我们什么时候见面？我常常想起你，你却不知道。我从来没有像你这样被一个男人如此吸引。我感觉很糟糕。请给我写一封长信并告诉我更多信息。记住，如果你不这样做，我会惩罚你。现在你知道如果你不写的话我会对你做什么，你这个顽皮的孩子。哦，我多么渴望见到你。亲爱的亨利，在我的耐心耗尽之前，请不要拒绝我的请求。然后我就告诉你一切。现在再见了，淘气的宝贝，我头疼得厉害。今天。并写回你的渴望

Martha
玛莎

P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.
P.S.请告诉我你妻子使用哪种香水。我想知道。

He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s perfume. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.
他郑重其事地从花夹上撕下那朵花，闻到几乎没有任何气味，然后把它放进了他的心袋里。花的语言。他们喜欢它，因为没有人能听到。或者用毒花束把他打倒。然后他慢慢地向前走，又读了一遍信，时不时地咕哝着一个词。愤怒的郁金香和你亲爱的曼花一起惩罚你的仙人掌，如果你不高兴可怜的忘记我如何长紫罗兰到亲爱的玫瑰，当我们很快银莲花遇到所有顽皮的夜莺妻子玛莎的香水。读完之后，他从报纸上拿出来，放回侧袋里。

Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course. Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
微弱的喜悦张开双唇。自第一封信以来已发生变化。奇怪这是她自己写的。干愤慨：像我这样出身名门的姑娘，品行可敬。可以在念珠后的一个周日见面。谢谢：没有。平常的恋爱打闹。然后绕着拐角跑。和莫莉吵架一样糟糕。雪茄具有清凉作用。麻醉剂。下次走得更远。顽皮男孩：惩罚：当然是怕话。残酷，为什么不呢？无论如何尝试一下。一次一点。

Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without thorns.
他用手摸着口袋里的信，把别针拔了出来。普通引脚，嗯？他把它扔在路上。从她衣服的某个地方脱下来：用别针别在一起。奇怪的是他们总是拥有的引脚数量。没有不带刺的玫瑰。

Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.
平淡的都柏林声音在他脑海中咆哮。那天晚上在库姆，那两个荡妇在雨中缠在一起。

O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers.
哦，玛丽丢了抽屉的别针。

She didn’t know what to do
她不知道该怎么办

To keep it up
为了坚持下去

To keep it up.
坚持下去。

It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife use. Now could you make out a thing like that?
它？他们。真是头疼极了。可能有她的玫瑰。或者整天坐着打字。眼睛聚焦对胃神经不利。你老婆用什么香水。现在你能弄清楚这样的事情吗？

To keep it up.
坚持下去。

Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.
玛莎，玛丽。我在某个地方看到过那张照片，现在我忘记了，老主人，或者是为了钱而伪造的。他正坐在他们的房子里说话。神秘。库姆里的两个荡妇也会听。

To keep it up.
坚持下去。

Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.
晚上的感觉真好。不用再到处流浪了。就懒洋洋地躺在那里：安静的黄昏：让一切撕裂。忘记。说说你去过的地方，奇怪的习俗。另一个头上顶着罐子，正在准备晚饭：水果、橄榄、井里的清凉水，像阿什敦墙上的洞一样冰冷。下次我去跑步比赛时一定要带纸高脚杯。她用一双又黑又温柔的大眼睛听着。告诉她：越来越多：全部。然后一声叹息：沉默。长长长长的休息。

Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.
他走到铁路拱门下，取出信封，迅速撕成碎片，撒向公路。碎片飞舞而去，沉入潮湿的空气中：一阵白色的飘动，然后全部沉没。

Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.
亨利·弗劳尔.你可以用同样的方式撕掉一张一百英镑的支票。简单的一张纸。伊维勋爵曾经在爱尔兰银行兑现了一张价值一百万美元的七位数支票。向您展示从波特身上可以赚到的钱。他们说，另一位兄弟阿迪劳恩勋爵每天必须更换衬衫四次。皮肤会滋生虱子或害虫。一百万英镑，等一下。两便士一品脱，四便士一夸脱，八便士一加仑波特酒，不，一又四便士一加仑波特酒。一加四变成二十：大约十五。对，就是这样。一千五百万桶波特酒。

What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.
我在说什么桶？加仑。大约一百万桶都是一样的。

An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.
一列即将驶来的火车在他头顶上沉重地叮当作响，一辆又一辆车厢。木桶撞在他的头上：迟钝的搬运工溢出并在里面翻腾。桶盖突然打开，一股巨大的、沉闷的洪水漏了出来，流在一起，蜿蜒穿过平坦土地上的泥滩，一个缓慢的池状液体漩涡带着宽叶的泡沫花。

He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.
他已经到达了万圣节敞开的后门。他走进门廊，脱下帽子，从口袋里掏出卡片，又把它塞到皮革发带后面。该死的。我可能会尝试与麦考伊合作以获得通往穆林加的通行证。

Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J. on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true religion. Save China’s millions. Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for them. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t. They’re taught that. He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.
门上也有同样的告示。约翰·康米 (John Conmee) 牧师的布道关于圣彼得·克拉弗 S.J.和非洲使团。当格莱斯顿几乎失去知觉时，他们也为他的皈依祈祷。新教徒也是一样。皈依威廉·J·沃尔什博士 (Dr William J. Walsh D.D.)到真正的宗教。拯救中国数百万人。不知道他们如何向异教徒中国人解释这一点。更喜欢一盎司鸦片。天人。对他们来说是异端。他们的神佛陀侧卧在博物馆里。轻松地将手放在脸颊下。香火燃烧。不像Ecce Homo。荆棘冠冕和十字架。聪明的主意圣帕特里克三叶草。筷子？康米：马丁·坎宁安认识他：相貌出众。抱歉，我没有说服他让莫莉加入唱诗班，而是让法利神父加入合唱团，法利神父看起来很傻，但事实并非如此。他们被教导了这一点。他不会戴着蓝色眼镜，汗流浃背地出去为黑人施洗，不是吗？眼镜会很吸引人，闪闪发光。喜欢看到他们围成一圈，嘴唇圆润，出神地聆听。静物。我想，像喝牛奶一样把它舔起来吧。

The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.
圣石冰冷的气息呼唤着他。他踏着破旧的台阶，推开平开门，从门厅轻轻走进去。

Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? Corpus: body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.
正在发生一些事情：一些联谊。可惜如此空虚。不错的谨慎地方，旁边有一些女孩。谁是我的邻居？每小时都被缓慢的音乐所堵塞。午夜弥撒中的那个女人。七重天。妇女们跪在长凳上，脖子上套着深红色的缰绳，低着头。一批人跪在祭坛栏杆前。神父从他们身边走过，手里拿着那个东西，低声说道。他在每一个地方都停下来，拿出一份圣餐，抖掉一两滴（它们在水里吗？），然后整齐地放进她嘴里。她的帽子和头沉了下去。然后是下一张。她的帽子立刻沉了下来。然后是下一个：一个矮小的老妇人。神父弯下腰将它放入她的嘴里，嘴里一直咕哝着。拉丁。下一个。闭上眼睛，张开嘴。什么？语料库：本体。尸体。拉丁语好主意。先把他们打昏。临终者的临终关怀。他们似乎不咀嚼它：只是吞下它。朗姆酒的想法：吃尸体的碎片。为什么食人者会喜欢它。

He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it’s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it’s called. There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I’m sure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.
他站在一旁，看着他们的盲目面具一张一张地穿过过道，寻找自己的位置。他走近一张长凳，坐在角落里，一边拿着帽子和报纸。这些锅我们得穿。我们应该戴上以我们的头为原型的帽子。他们到处围着他，头仍然低垂在深红色的缰绳里，等待着它在他们的胃里融化。就像那些马佐斯一样：就是那种面包：无酵陈设饼。看他们。现在我敢打赌这会让他们感到高兴。棒糖。确实如此。是的，这就是所谓的天使面包。它背后有一个伟大的想法，一种神的国度就在你的感觉之中。第一个沟通者。一分钱一分货。然后感觉就像一个家庭聚会，同样在剧院，都在同一次游泳中。他们是这样。我确信这一点。没那么孤独。在我们的兄弟会里。然后出来有点疯狂。释放蒸汽。问题是你是否真的相信它。卢尔德治愈、遗忘之水、诺克幽灵、雕像流血。老家伙在忏悔室附近睡着了。因此就有那些鼾声。迷信。安全地来到王国的怀抱中。平息一切痛苦。明年这个时候醒来。

He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn’t know what to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.
他看到神父把圣餐杯收好，然后跪在圣杯前，露出他穿着的蕾丝外衣下面的一只灰色大鞋底。假设他丢失了自己的别针。他不知道该怎么办。后面秃了点。他背上写着：I.N.R.I？否：I.H.S.有一次我问莫莉时，她告诉了我。我犯了罪：或者没有：我受过苦，确实如此。另一个呢？铁钉钻了进去。

Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something shiftylooking about them. They’re not straight men of business either. O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.
玫瑰经后的一个星期日见面。不要拒绝我的要求。带着面纱和黑色包出现。黄昏和她身后的灯光。她可能脖子上系着一条丝带，但仍然偷偷地做其他事情。他们的性格。那个把女王的证据变成无敌的家伙，他曾经接受过，凯里是他的名字，每天早上的圣餐。就是这个教堂。彼得·凯里，是的。不，我想到的是彼得·克拉弗。丹尼斯·凯里.想象一下吧。妻子和六个孩子在家。并一直在策划谋杀。那些小龙虾，这对他们来说是个好名字，他们身上总是有一些狡猾的东西。他们也不是正直的商人。哦，不，她不在这里：花：不，不。顺便问一下，我撕了那个信封吗？是的：在桥下。

The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale (aromatic). Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.
牧师正在冲洗圣杯：然后他巧妙地扔掉了残渣。葡萄酒。例如，如果他喝他们习惯的吉尼斯黑啤酒或一些节制饮料惠特利都柏林啤酒花苦味酒或坎特雷尔和科克伦姜汁汽水（芳香），这会使其更具贵族气息。不给他们任何东西：展示酒：只展示另一个。冰冷的安慰。虔诚的欺诈，但却是正确的：否则他们就会有一个比另一个更糟糕的老酒鬼过来，乞讨一杯饮料。整个气氛很奇怪。完全正确。完全正确。

Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the vibrato: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the Stabat Mater of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:
布卢姆先生回头看向唱诗班。不会有任何音乐。遗憾。我想知道谁有这个器官？老格林，他知道如何让颤音这种乐器说话：他们说他在加德纳街一年有五十英镑。那天莫莉的声音很好，就像罗西尼的圣母颂一样。首先是伯纳德·沃恩神父的布道。基督还是彼拉多？天啊，但别让我们整晚都在想这件事。他们想要的音乐。足操停止了。一根针掉下来都能听见。我告诉她把声音对准那个角落。我能感受到空气中的激动，饱满，人们抬头：

Quis est homo.
Quis est homo。

Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words. Mozart’s twelfth mass: Gloria in that. Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after. Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don’t they? Gluttons, tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.
有些古老的神圣音乐非常美妙。梅尔卡丹特：最后七句话。莫扎特的第十二弥撒：其中的格洛丽亚。那些老教皇热衷于音乐、艺术、各种雕像和图画。帕莱斯特里纳也是如此。他们度过了一段愉快的旧时光。健康也，念经，定时作息，然后酿利口酒。本笃会。绿色黄绿色。尽管如此，他们的唱诗班里有太监，这有点厚重。是什么样的声音？一定很想听听他们自己强劲的低音。鉴赏家。假设他们之后不会有任何感觉。有点平静。别担心。变成肉身，不是吗？贪吃，个子高，腿长。谁知道？宦官。摆脱它的一种方法。

He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:
他看到神父弯下腰亲吻祭坛，然后转过身来为所有的人祝福。所有人都画了十字并站了起来。布卢姆先生环顾四周，然后站起身来，俯视着举起的帽子。当然，要在福音面前站起来。然后所有人再次跪下，他静静地坐回长凳上。神父从祭坛上走下来，把东西从他手里拿出来，他和弥撒童用拉丁语互相回答。然后神父跪下，开始念一张卡片：

—O God, our refuge and our strength …
——上帝啊，我们的避难所和我们的力量……

Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More interesting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise. God’s little joke. Then out she comes. Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting. How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show. And don’t they rake in the money too? Bequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything. Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.
布卢姆先生把脸凑过去听听他的话。英语。把骨头扔给他们。我稍微记得一下。距离你上次做弥撒已有多久了？光荣而纯洁的处女。约瑟夫，她的配偶。彼得和保罗。如果你了解它的全部内容，那就更有趣了。当然，组织很棒，运行得像发条一样。忏悔。每个人都想。然后我就告诉你一切。苦修。请惩罚我吧他们手中的伟大武器。不仅仅是医生或律师。女人欲罢不能。我 schschschschschsch。你有恰恰吗？你为什么这么做？低头看着她的戒指，寻找借口。回音壁有耳朵。丈夫得知后大吃一惊。上帝开的一个小玩笑。然后她就出来了。肤浅的悔改。可爱的耻辱。在祭坛前祈祷。万福玛利亚和圣母玛利亚。鲜花，焚香，蜡烛融化。隐藏她的脸红。救世军公然模仿。改过自新的妓女将在会上发言。我如何找到主。这些方头小伙子一定是在罗马：他们在整场演出中都在工作。他们不也赚到钱了吗？遗赠还有：给 P.P.暂时由他绝对酌情决定。敞开大门公开为我的灵魂安息举行弥撒。修道院和修道院。弗马纳的牧师将出庭作证。没有威吓他。他对一切都有自己的答案。我们神圣母亲教会的自由和崇高。教会的圣师们：他们制定了教会的整个神学。

The priest prayed:
神父祈祷道：

—Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.
——有福的米迦勒，大天使，请在冲突时刻保护我们。保护我们免遭魔鬼的邪恶和网罗（愿上帝约束他，我们谦卑地祈祷！）：天军的君王啊，你靠上帝的力量将撒但和其他邪恶的人一起推入地狱吗？为毁灭灵魂而游走于世间的灵魂。

The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women remained behind: thanksgiving.
神父和弥撒站起来走开了。遍。妇女们留下来：感恩节。

Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.
最好还是一起推着走吧。巴兹兄弟。也许带着盘子过来吧。缴纳复活节税。

He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there’s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don’t. Why didn’t you tell me before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn’t farther south. He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott’s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice because I’m in mourning myself. He covered himself. How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny’s in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long’s, founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.
他站了起来。你好。我背心的那两颗纽扣一直开着吗？女人很享受。永远不会告诉你。但我们。对不起，小姐，有一点（哇！） 只是一点（哇！） 绒毛。或者她们的裙子在后面，衣襟解开。月亮的一瞥。如果你不这样做，我会很生气。你之前为什么不告诉我。还是喜欢你不整洁的样子。干得好，就在不远的南方。他小心翼翼地扣好扣子，穿过过道，穿过大门，来到灯光下。他在冰冷的黑色大理石碗旁站了一会儿，一动不动，面前和身后有两个崇拜者偷偷地将手浸入低潮的圣水里。有轨电车：一辆普雷斯科特染厂的车：一个穿着杂草的寡妇。请注意，因为我自己也在哀悼。他把自己盖住了。时间过得怎么样？四分之一过去了。时间还够。最好把乳液弄好。这是哪里？啊，是的，最后一次。斯温尼在林肯宫。化学家很少移动。他们的绿色和金色信标罐太重，无法搅拌。汉密尔顿朗氏 (Hamilton Long’s) 成立于洪水那年。胡格诺教堂墓地就在附近。改天去拜访一下。

He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair. O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault. When was it I got it made up last? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.
他沿着韦斯特兰街向南走。但配方在另一条裤子里。哦，我也忘记了那把钥匙。承办了这件丧事。噢，可怜的家伙，这不是他的错。我上次化妆是什么时候？等待。我记得我换了一个主权。一定是本月的第一天或第二个月。哦，他可以在处方簿上查一下。

The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher’s stone. The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid. Smell almost cure you like the dentist’s doorbell. Doctor Whack. He ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Clever of nature.
化学家一页一页地往后翻。桑迪身上似乎有干瘪的气味。缩小的头骨。而且老了。寻找点金石。炼金术士们。精神兴奋后，药物会使人变老。然后就昏昏欲睡了。为什么？反应。一生一夜。逐渐改变你的性格。整天生活在草药、药膏、消毒剂之中。他所有的雪花石膏百合花。研钵和研杵。水。区。福尔。劳尔.特维里德。气味几乎可以治愈你，就像牙医的门铃一样。威克医生。他应该好好锻炼一下自己。冲剂或乳剂。第一个采药来治愈自己的人是有勇气的。简单。想要小心一点。这里的东西足够你用氯仿了。试验：蓝色石蕊试纸变红。氯仿。过量服用鸦片酊。睡眠气流。恋情。 Paragoric罂粟糖浆对咳嗽不利。堵塞毛孔或痰。毒药是唯一的治疗方法。在您最意想不到的地方进行补救。生性聪明。

—About a fortnight ago, sir?
——大约两周前，先生？

—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
——是的，布鲁姆先生说。

He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.
他在柜台旁等待，慢慢地吸入浓烈的毒品气味，以及海绵和丝瓜络的灰尘干燥气味。花了很多时间来讲述你的疼痛。

—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water …
——甜杏仁油和安息香酊剂，布鲁姆先生说，然后是橙花水……

It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.
这确实让她的皮肤变得像蜡一样细腻白皙。

—And white wax also, he said.
——还有白蜡，他说。

Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk. Skinfood. One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it? had only one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? Peau d’Espagne. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
衬托出她眼中的黑暗。当我修理袖口的链扣时，她看着我，床单盖住了她的眼睛，西班牙风格，闻着自己的味道。这些家常食谱往往是最好的：草莓对牙齿来说：荨麻和雨水：他们说浸泡在酪乳中的燕麦片。皮肤食品。是老王后的儿子之一，奥尔巴尼公爵吗？只有一张皮肤。利奥波德，是的。我们有三个。疣、拇囊炎和丘疹使情况变得更糟。但你也想要香水。你的香水是什么？西班牙油。那个橙花水真新鲜。这些肥皂的味道很香。纯凝乳皂。是时候在拐角处洗澡了。土耳其浴室。土耳其。按摩。污垢会卷入你的肚脐。如果是一个好女孩做的就更好了。我也想我。是的，我。在浴室里做。好奇的渴望I.水对水。将商务与娱乐结合起来。可惜没有时间按摩。然后一整天都感觉神清气爽。葬礼相当阴郁。

—Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a bottle?
——是的，先生，化学家说。那是两点和九点。你带了一瓶吗？

—No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I’ll call later in the day and I’ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?
——不，布鲁姆先生说。请补一下。当天晚些时候我会打电话给我，我会拿一张肥皂。他们值多少钱？

—Fourpence, sir.
——四便士，先生。

Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.
布卢姆先生把一块蛋糕举到鼻孔前。甜柠檬蜡。

—I’ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.
——我要这个，他说。相当于三便士。

—Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.
——是的，先生，化学家说。先生，等你回来的时候，你就可以一起付清了。

—Good, Mr Bloom said.
——很好，布卢姆先生说。

He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.
他腋下夹着报纸棒，左手拿着凉凉的肥皂，走出商店。

At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:
班塔姆·莱昂斯的声音和手在他的腋下说道：

—Hello, Bloom. What’s the best news? Is that today’s? Show us a minute.
——你好，布鲁姆。最好的消息是什么？是今天的吗？给我们展示一分钟。

Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
老天爷又把他的胡子剃掉了！长而冰冷的上唇。为了看起来更年轻。他看起来确实很温和。比我年轻。

Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears’ soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
班塔姆·莱昂斯用长着黑指甲的黄色手指展开了接力棒。也想洗一洗。除去粗糙的污垢。早上好，你用过梨子肥皂吗？肩膀上有头皮屑。头皮需要出油。

—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?
——我想看看今天奔跑的那匹法国马，班塔姆·里昂斯说。坏蛋在哪里？

He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. Barber’s itch. Tight collar he’ll lose his hair. Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.
他把打褶的书页沙沙作响，把下巴放在高领上。理发师的痒。领子太紧他会掉头发。最好把报纸留给他，然后离他远点。

—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.
——你可以保留它，布鲁姆先生说。

—Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the second.
——阿斯科特。金杯.等等，班塔姆·莱昂斯嘀咕道。半莫。最大第二个。

—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.
——我正打算把它扔掉，布卢姆先生说。

Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.
班塔姆·莱昂斯突然抬起眼睛，微弱地斜视着。

—What’s that? his sharp voice said.
-那是什么？他尖锐的声音说道。

—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away that moment.
——我说你可以保留它，布卢姆先生回答。那一刻我想把它扔掉。

Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.
班塔姆·莱昂斯一瞬间怀疑了，斜视着：然后把展开的床单推回到布鲁姆先生的手臂上。

—I’ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.
——我愿意冒这个险，他说。在这里，谢谢。

He sped off towards Conway’s corner. God speed scut.
他飞快地朝康威的角落跑去。神速冲锋。

Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now. They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.
布卢姆先生再次把床单折成整齐的正方形，然后把肥皂放进去，微笑着。那家伙的愚蠢的嘴唇。投注。最近它的常规温床。信使男孩偷窃是为了换取六便士。大型嫩火鸡抽奖活动。你的圣诞晚餐只要三便士。杰克·弗莱明贪污赌博，然后偷渡到美国。现在开一家旅馆。他们永远不会回来。埃及的肉罐。

He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college. Something to catch the eye.
他高高兴兴地朝浴场清真寺走去。让你想起清真寺、红烧砖、尖塔。今天我看到了大学运动会。他看着大学公园大门上方的马蹄形海报：骑自行车的人像锅里的鳕鱼一样弯腰。该死的糟糕广告。现在，如果他们把它像轮子一样转起来就好了。然后是辐条：体育、体育、体育：以及大中心：大学。一些吸引眼球的东西。

There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge. Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How do you do, sir?
霍恩布洛尔站在门房处。把他放在手边：可能会在点头时在那里轮流。你好吗，霍恩布洛尔先生？先生，你好吗？

Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather. Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can’t play it here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the floor. Heatwave. Won’t last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.
真是天堂般的天气。如果生活一直都是这样就好了。板球天气。坐在遮阳伞下。结束了又结束了。出去。他们不能在这里玩。鸭子有六个小门。卡勒船长仍然用方腿用力踩碎了基尔代尔街头俱乐部的一扇窗户。唐尼布鲁克更符合他们的风格。当麦卡锡发言时，我们的头骨都在破裂。热浪。不会持续的。生命的河流总是在流逝，我们在生命的河流中所追寻的，比它们都更加珍贵。

Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream. This is my body.
现在就享受沐浴吧：干净的水槽、清凉的搪瓷、温和温热的溪流。这是我的身体。

He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.
他预见到自己苍白的身体完全赤裸地斜倚在里面，在温暖的子宫里，涂着芳香融化的肥皂，轻轻地沐浴着。他看到他的躯干和四肢荡漾起来，被支撑着，轻轻地向上浮起，柠檬黄色：他的肚脐，肉芽：他看到灌木丛中深色纠结的卷发漂浮着，漂浮着溪流的头发，围绕着千人之父的软弱的父亲，慵懒地漂浮着花。

Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.
马丁·坎宁安首先将戴着丝绸帽子的头探进嘎吱作响的马车里，然后熟练地坐了下来。鲍尔先生跟在他后面走了进来，小心翼翼地弯曲了自己的身高。

—Come on, Simon.
——来吧，西蒙。

—After you, Mr Bloom said.
——在你之后，布卢姆先生说。

Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
迪达勒斯先生迅速捂住自己，钻了进去，说道：

Yes, yes.
是的是的。

—Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
——我们现在都在这儿了吗？马丁·坎宁安问道。来吧，布鲁姆。

Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.
布卢姆先生进来并坐在空位上。他把门拉到身后，砰地关上两下，直到门关紧。他将一只手臂穿过臂带，从开着的车窗严肃地看着大道上垂下的百叶窗。其中一个被拖到一边：一位老妇人在偷看。鼻子发白，贴在窗玻璃上。感谢她的星星，她被忽略了。他们对尸体的兴趣非同寻常。很高兴看到我们离开，我们给他们带来了很多麻烦。工作似乎适合他们。角落里的拥抱者。穿着拖鞋走来走去，生怕他醒来。然后就准备好了。把它摆出来。莫莉和弗莱明夫人在整理床铺。将其更多地拉到您身边。我们的裹尸布。永远不知道谁会碰死你。清洗并洗发。我相信他们会剪指甲和头发。将一点放入信封中。以后长起来都一样。不干净的工作。

All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
所有人都在等待。什么也没说。可能是存放花圈。我坐在坚硬的东西上。啊，那块肥皂：在我的臀部口袋里。最好把它移开。等待机会。

All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.
所有人都在等待。然后前面传来车轮转动的声音：然后更近了：然后是马蹄声。一阵震动。他们的马车开始移动，嘎吱嘎吱地摇晃着。其他的马蹄声和吱吱作响的车轮在后面响起。大街上的百叶窗过去了，九号门环上有褶皱，门半开着。以步行的速度。

They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.
他们静静地等待着，膝盖在慢慢地蠕动，直到他们转身沿着电车轨道行驶。特里顿维尔路。更快一点。车轮在鹅卵石铺成的堤道上滚动，嘎嘎作响，疯狂的眼镜在门框上摇晃，嘎嘎作响。

—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
——他要带我们走哪条路？鲍尔先生透过两扇窗户问道。

—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
——爱尔兰镇，马丁·坎宁安说。林森德。布伦瑞克街。

Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
迪达勒斯先生点点头，向外看去。

—That’s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.
——这是一个很好的古老习俗，他说。我很高兴看到它还没有消失。

All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.
所有人都透过窗户观看了一会儿，帽子和帽子被路人举起。尊重。马车从电车轨道转向经过水巷的更平坦的道路。布卢姆先生凝视着一个身着丧服、戴着宽帽子的轻盈的年轻人。

—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
——你的一个朋友迪达勒斯去世了，他说。

—Who is that?
-那是谁？

—Your son and heir.
——你的儿子和继承人。

—Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
-他在哪里？迪达勒斯先生说着，伸了个懒腰。

The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:
马车驶过公寓楼前的露天排水沟和破碎的道路时，摇摇晃晃地转过街角，然后转向有轨电车轨道，车轮嘎嘎作响，一路滚动。迪达勒斯先生向后退了一步，说道：

—Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!
——那个穆里根无赖和他在一起吗？他的fidus Achates！

—No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
——不，布鲁姆先生说。他独自一人。

—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
——我想，打倒他的莎莉姨妈，德达勒斯先生说，打倒古尔丁派系，那个醉酒的小成本抽屉，还有克里西，爸爸的小粪，认识自己父亲的聪明孩子。

Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.
布卢姆先生在林森德路上无忧无虑地微笑着。华莱士兄弟：瓶子厂：多德桥。

Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady’s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he’ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.
里奇·古尔丁和法律包。他称这家公司为古尔丁、科利斯和沃德。他的笑话变得有点潮湿了。他是一张很棒的卡片。周日早上，伊格内修斯·加拉赫在斯塔默街跳华尔兹，女房东的两顶帽子戴在他头上。整晚都在外狂暴。现在开始告诉他：我担心他的背痛。妻子熨烫他的背。认为他会用药丸治愈它。它们都是面包屑。利润大约百分之六百。

—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
——他和一群卑鄙的人在一起，迪达勒斯先生咆哮道。从各方面来看，穆里根都是一个被污染的、血淋淋的恶棍。他的名字在都柏林都臭名昭著。但在上帝和他祝福的母亲的帮助下，我会以有一天给他的母亲或阿姨或任何能让她大开眼界的人写一封信作为我的职责。我会为他的灾难挠痒痒，相信我。

He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
他在车轮的嘎嘎声中大声喊道：

—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper’s son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Not likely.
——我不会让她这个侄子的私生子毁了我的儿子。店员的儿子。在我表弟 Peter Paul M'Swiney 的商店里卖磁带。不见得。

He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I’m dying for it. How life begins.
他停了下来。布卢姆先生的目光从他愤怒的小胡子转向鲍尔先生温和的脸庞和马丁·坎宁安的眼睛和胡须，他的眼睛和胡须严重颤抖。吵闹任性的人。满满都是他的儿子。他是对的。有东西可以递上。如果小鲁迪还活着就好了。看着他长大。屋里听见他的声音。穿着伊顿公学套装走在莫莉身边。我的儿子。他眼里的我。那种感觉会很奇怪。从我。只是一个机会。一定是那天早上，在雷蒙德露台上，她站在窗前，看着墙边的两只狗停止作恶。中士也笑了。她穿着那件奶油色长袍，但她从未缝合过裂口。给我们一点帮助，波尔迪。天啊，我快要死了。生命如何开始。

Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.
那时候就大了不得不拒绝灰石乐队的音乐会。我的儿子在她体内。我本来可以在生活上帮助他的。我可以。让他独立。也学德语。

—Are we late? Mr Power asked.
-我们晚了吗？鲍尔先生问道。

—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
——十分钟，马丁·坎宁安看着手表说道。

Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.
莫莉。米莉.同样的事情被淡化了。她假小子的誓言。跳跃的木星啊！你们这些神和小鱼们！尽管如此，她还是一个可爱的女孩。很快就成为一个女人。穆林加尔。最亲爱的帕普利。年轻的学生。是的，是的：也是一个女人。生活，生活。

The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
马车向后倾斜，四个行李箱摇晃着。

—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
——鲍尔先生说，老套可能会给我们带来更宽松的束缚。

—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?
——迪达勒斯先生说，如果他没有那个困扰他的斜视的话，他可能会这么做。你听懂了吗？

He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.
他闭上了左眼。马丁·坎宁安开始拂去大腿下面的面包屑。

—What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
——这是什么，他说，以上帝的名义？面包屑？

—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.
——最近似乎有人在这里举办野餐派对，鲍尔先生说。

All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:
所有人都抬起大腿，用不悦的眼神看着发霉的无扣皮革座椅。迪达勒斯先生扭动鼻子，皱起眉头说道：

—Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
——除非我大错特错了。你觉得怎么样，马丁？

—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
——这也让我震惊，马丁·坎宁安说。

Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
布卢姆先生放下了大腿。很高兴我洗了澡。感觉我的脚很干净。但我希望弗莱明夫人把这些袜子补补得更好一些。

Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
迪达勒斯先生无奈地叹了口气。

—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.
——毕竟，他说，这是世界上最自然的事情。

—Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.
——汤姆·克南出现了吗？马丁·坎宁安问道，轻轻地捻弄着胡子尖。

—Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
——是的，布卢姆先生回答。他落后于内德·兰伯特和海因斯。

—And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
——科尼·凯莱赫本人呢？鲍尔先生问道。

—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
——在墓地，马丁·坎宁安说。

—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.
——我今天早上见到了麦考伊，布鲁姆先生说。他说他会尽力来。

The carriage halted short.
马车短暂停了下来。

—What’s wrong?
-怎么了？

—We’re stopped.
——我们停下来了。

—Where are we?
-我们在哪里？

Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.
布卢姆先生把头伸出窗外。

—The grand canal, he said.
——大运河，他说。

Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t miss this chance. Dogs’ home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men’s dogs usually are.
煤气厂。他们说它可以治愈百日咳。干得好，米莉从来没有得到过。可怜的孩子！它们在抽搐中翻倍，青一块紫一块。真是耻辱。与疾病相比，过得还算轻松。只有麻疹。亚麻籽茶。猩红热，流感流行。为死而游说。不要错过这个机会。狗的家在那边。可怜的老阿托斯！善待阿托斯，利奥波德，是我最后的愿望。你的旨意一定会实现。我们在坟墓里服从他们。临终的潦草。他把它记在心里，憔悴不堪。安静的野蛮人。老人养的狗通常都是这样。

A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
一滴雨滴溅到了他的帽子上。他退后一步，看到灰色的旗帜上瞬间出现了阵雨。分开。好奇的。就像通过漏勺一样。我以为会的。我现在记得我的靴子吱吱作响。

—The weather is changing, he said quietly.
——天气正在变化，他轻声说道。

—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
——遗憾的是，它没有保持良好状态，马丁·坎宁安说。

—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming out.
——国家通缉，鲍尔先生说。太阳又出来了。

Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.
迪达勒斯先生透过眼镜凝视着被遮蔽的太阳，对天空发出无声的咒骂。

—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.
——就像孩子的屁股一样不确定，他说。

—We’re off again.
——我们又出发了。

The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
马车又转动了僵硬的轮子，他们的行李箱轻轻摇晃起来。马丁·坎宁安更快地捻动着胡子顶。

—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.
——汤姆·克南昨晚表现出色，他说。帕迪·伦纳德把他当面打倒了。

—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of The Croppy Boy.
——噢，把他拉出来，马丁，鲍尔先生急切地说。西蒙，等你听到他在本·多拉德 (Ben Dollard) 演唱的《The Croppy Boy》中的声音。

—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience.
——巨大，马丁坎宁安傲慢地说。他演唱的那首简单的民谣《马丁》是我在整个经历中听过的最尖锐的演绎。

—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And the retrospective arrangement.
——太棒了，鲍尔先生笑着说道。他对此非常着迷。以及回顾性安排。

—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
——你读过丹·道森的演讲吗？马丁·坎宁安问道。

—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
——当时我没有，迪达勒斯先生说。它在哪里？

—In the paper this morning.
——今天早上的报纸上。

Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.
布卢姆先生从内袋里拿出那张纸。我必须为她改变那本书。

—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
——不，不，迪达勒斯先生很快说道。稍后请。

Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month’s mind: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
布卢姆先生的目光扫过纸的边缘，扫视着死亡者：卡兰、科尔曼、迪格纳姆、福西特、洛瑞、瑙曼、皮克，那是哪个皮克？是克罗斯比和阿莱恩店里的那个家伙吗？不，塞克斯顿，厄布赖特。墨迹在磨损的碎纸上快速褪色。感谢小花。可惜错过了。给他带来难以言表的悲痛。经历了漫长而乏味的疾病后，享年 88 岁。月心：昆兰。亲爱的耶稣怜悯谁的灵魂。

It is now a month since dear Henry fled
亲爱的亨利逃离已经一个月了

To his home up above in the sky
到他在天上的家

While his family weeps and mourns his loss
当他的家人哭泣并哀悼他的去世时

Hoping some day to meet him on high.
希望有一天能在高处见到他。

I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.
我把信封撕了？是的。我在浴室里读完她的信后把它放在哪里了？他拍了拍背心口袋。那里好吧。亲爱的亨利逃跑了。在我的耐心耗尽之前。

National school. Meade’s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.
国立学校。米德的院子。危险。现在只有两个人了。点头。满满当当。他们头骨里的骨头太多了。另一个带着车费小跑着。一小时前我路过那里。贾维夫妇举起了帽子。

A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?
一名巡检员的背突然挺直了，靠在布卢姆先生窗边的电车标准上。难道他们就不能发明一些自动的东西，让轮子本身更方便吗？好吧，但是那个家伙会丢掉工作吗？好吧，但是另一个人会找到一份制作新发明的工作吗？

Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.
古老的音乐厅。那里什么也没有。一个穿着浅黄色西装、戴着黑纱臂环的男人。那里没有太多悲伤。季度哀悼。也许是法律界的人。

They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. Fun on the Bristol. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it’s long.
他们经过圣马可教堂荒凉的讲坛，经过铁路桥下，经过女王剧院：一片寂静。围板：尤金·斯特拉顿，班德曼·帕尔默夫人。我想知道今晚我能去看莉娅吗？我说的是我。还是基拉尼百合？埃尔斯特·格莱姆斯歌剧公司。大而有力的改变。下周的湿亮钞票。布里斯托尔的乐趣。马丁·坎宁安可以为欢乐号传球。必须喝一两杯。有多长就有多宽。

He’s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
他下午来。她的歌。

Plasto’s. Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?
普拉斯托的。菲利普·克兰普顿爵士的纪念喷泉半身像。他是谁？

—How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.
-你好吗？马丁·坎宁安说着，将手掌举到额头上行礼。

—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
——他没有看到我们，鲍尔先生说。是的，他确实如此。你好吗？

—Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
-WHO？迪达勒斯先生问道。

—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
——布莱兹·博伊兰，鲍尔先生说。他正在那里吹气。

Just that moment I was thinking.
就在那一刻我在想。

Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.
迪达勒斯先生弯腰行礼。红岸门外，一顶白色的草帽圆盘闪过，回复：云杉身影：通过了。

Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.
布卢姆先生检查了左手的指甲，然后检查了右手的指甲。指甲，是的。她在他身上还看到了什么吗？魅力。都柏林最糟糕的人。这让他活了下来。他们有时会感觉到一个人是什么。直觉。但就是这样的类型。我的指甲。我只是看着它们：削得很好。之后：独自思考。身体有些软了。我会注意到：从记忆中。是什么原因造成的？我想当肉脱落时，皮肤不能足够快地收缩。但形状就在那里。形状还在。肩膀。臀部。丰满。舞会之夜的着装。转变卡在后面的脸颊之间。

He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.
他双手抱在膝盖之间，心满意足地用茫然的目光扫过他们的脸。

Mr Power asked:
鲍尔先生问道：

—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
——巡回演唱会进行得怎么样，布鲁姆？

—O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a good idea, you see …
——哦，很好，布卢姆先生说。我听到过很多关于它的记载。这是个好主意，你看……

—Are you going yourself?
——你自己去吗？

—Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
——嗯，不，布鲁姆先生说。事实上，我必须去克莱尔郡处理一些私人事务。你看，这个想法是游览主要城镇。你在一个方面失去的东西可以在另一个方面弥补。

—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
——确实如此，马丁·坎宁安说。玛丽·安德森现在就在那里。

Have you good artists?
你们有好的艺术家吗？

—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have all topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.
——路易斯·沃纳正在巡演她，布鲁姆先生说。哦，是的，我们都会有顶级贵族。 J. C. Doyle 和 John MacCormack 我希望如此。事实上，最好的。

—And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
——夫人，鲍尔先生微笑着说道。最后但并非最不重要的。

Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them. Smith O’Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.
布卢姆先生以一种温和礼貌的姿势松开了双手，然后又握紧了。史密斯·奥布莱恩。有人在那里放了一束花。女士。一定是他的忌日。为许多人带来幸福的回报。马车在法雷尔雕像旁驶过，无声无息地将他们毫无抵抗力的膝盖靠在一起。

Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.
乌特：一位衣着单调的老人站在路边递上他的商品，他张着嘴：乌特。

—Four bootlaces for a penny.
——四根鞋带一分钱。

Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O’Callaghan on his last legs.
想知道为什么他被从名单上剔除。他的办公室位于休姆街。与莫莉同名的沃特福德皇家律师特威迪位于同一所房子。从此便有了那顶丝绸帽子。旧礼仪的遗迹。哀也。可怕的堕落，可怜的家伙！像守灵时的鼻烟一样踢来踢去。奥卡拉汉生命垂危。

And Madame. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing her hair, humming. voglio e non vorrei. No. vorrei e non. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Mi trema un poco il. Beautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.
还有夫人。十一点二十分。向上。弗莱明夫人来打扫卫生。一边做着头发，一边哼着歌。沃利奥和非沃雷。没有。 vorrei e non。查看她的发尖，看看它们是否分叉。 Mi trema un poco il。她的声音很美：哭泣的语气。画眉鸟。一只画眉鸟。有一个词“throstle”可以表达这一点。

His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face. Greyish over the ears. Madame: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury’s. Or the Moira, was it?
他的目光轻轻扫过鲍尔先生英俊的脸庞。耳朵周围呈灰色。夫人：微笑。我回以微笑。微笑可以走很长的路。也许只是礼貌。好家伙。谁知道他养的女人是不是真的呢？对妻子来说不太愉快。然而他们说，是谁告诉我的，没有肉体。你会想象这会很快结束。是的，克罗夫顿有一天晚上遇见了他，给她带来了一磅牛臀肉。她这是什么？陪审团里的酒吧女招待。还是莫伊拉，是吗？

They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.
他们从披着巨大斗篷的解放者身下走过。

Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
马丁·坎宁安碰了碰鲍尔先生。

—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
——流便支派的，他说。

A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
一个高大的黑胡子人物，弯着一根棍子，在埃尔维象屋的拐角处踉踉跄跄地走着，向他们展示了一只弯曲的手放在他的脊椎上。

—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
——鲍尔先生说，他浑身散发着原始的美丽。

Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
迪达勒斯先生看着那人影，温和地说道：

—The devil break the hasp of your back!
——魔鬼折断你背上的搭扣！

Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue.
当马车经过格雷的雕像时，鲍尔先生笑得倒下了，他把脸挡在车窗上。

—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
——我们都经历过这种情况，马丁·坎宁安概括地说。

His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
他的目光与布鲁姆先生的目光相遇。他摸了摸胡须，补充道：

—Well, nearly all of us.
——嗯，几乎我们所有人。

Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.
布卢姆先生突然急切地对着同伴们说话。

—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.
——这是一篇关于鲁本·J 和儿子的非常好的文章。

—About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
——关于船夫？鲍尔先生问道。

—Yes. Isn’t it awfully good?
-是的。是不是非常好呢？

—What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn’t hear it.
-那是什么？迪达勒斯先生问道。我没听到。

—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both …
——案子里有一个女孩，布卢姆先生开始说道，他决定把他送到马恩岛远离危险，但当他们俩都……

—What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
-什么？迪达勒斯先生问道。这已经证实了该死的跛行是吗？

—Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown …
——是的，布鲁姆先生说。他们都在去船上的路上，他试图淹死……

—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
——淹死巴拉巴！迪达勒斯先生哭了。我希望他做到了！

Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
鲍尔先生从他被遮蔽的鼻孔里发出一声长长的笑声。

—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself …
——不，布鲁姆先生说，是儿子本人……

Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
马丁·坎宁安粗鲁地阻止了他的演讲：

—Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
——鲁本和儿子在去马恩岛的船上的途中，沿着河边的码头把它凿下来，年轻的凿子突然松了手，和他一起越过围墙进入了利菲河。

—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
-看在上帝的份上！迪达勒斯先生惊呼道。他死了吗？

—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
-死的！马丁·坎宁安哭了。不是他！一个船夫拿起一根竿子，抓住他裤子的松弛处把他捞了上来，然后他就被带到了码头上的父亲身边，生不如死。半个城镇都在那里。

—Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is …
——是的，布鲁姆先生说。但有趣的是……

—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life.
——马丁·坎宁安说，鲁本·J 给了船夫一弗罗林，以表彰他救了儿子的命。

A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.
鲍尔先生的手下传来一声压抑的叹息。

—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
——噢，他做到了，马丁·坎宁安肯定地说。就像一个英雄。银弗罗林。

—Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
——这不是很好吗？布鲁姆先生急切地说。

—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
——一又八便士太多了，迪达勒斯先生冷冷地说。

Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
鲍尔先生哽咽的笑声在车厢里悄然响起。

Nelson’s pillar.
纳尔逊的支柱。

—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
——一分钱八​​个李子！一分钱八个！

—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
——我们最好表现得严肃一点，马丁·坎宁安说。

Mr Dedalus sighed.
迪达勒斯先生叹了口气。

—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.
——啊，确实如此，他说，可怜的小帕迪不会吝惜我们的笑声。他对自己说，这是很多好事。

—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this. He’s gone from us.
——愿主宽恕我！鲍尔先生一边说，一边用手指擦着湿润的眼睛。可怜的帕迪！一周前，当我最后一次见到他时，我几乎没有想到我会像这样开车追他，当时他的健康状况还不错。他已经离开我们了。

—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.
——戴达勒斯先生说，戴帽子的小个子男人还是很正派的。他走得很突然。

—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
——崩溃，马丁·坎宁安说。心。

He tapped his chest sadly.
他悲伤地拍着胸口。

Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.
炽热的脸：红热。约翰·巴利康太多了。治疗红鼻子。像魔鬼一样喝酒，直到它变成酒精饮料。他花了很多钱给它上色。

Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
鲍尔先生忧心忡忡地看着路过的房屋。

—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
——他突然死了，可怜的家伙，他说。

—The best death, Mr Bloom said.
——最好的死法，布卢姆先生说。

Their wide open eyes looked at him.
他们睁大眼睛看着他。

—No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
——没有痛苦，他说。一会儿，一切就结束了。就像在睡梦中死去一样。

No-one spoke.
没有人说话。

Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.
这条街的死角。白天的生意很沉闷，土地经纪人，禁酒酒店，法尔科纳的铁路导游，公务员学院，吉尔的，天主教俱乐部，勤奋的盲人。为什么？一些原因。阳光或风。晚上也是。密友和奴隶。在已故马修神父的赞助下。帕内尔的奠基石。分解。心。

White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.
前额饰有白色羽毛的白马从圆形大厅的角落里驰骋而过。一口小棺材一闪而过。急忙埋葬。哀悼教练。未婚。黑色为已婚人士。花斑适合单身汉。邓为修女。

—Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
——悲伤，马丁坎宁安说。一个孩子。

A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was. Dwarf’s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If it’s healthy it’s from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck next time.
一张侏儒的脸，紫红色，布满皱纹，就像小鲁迪的脸一样。矮人的身体像油灰一样虚弱，放在一个白线交易箱里。殡葬友好社会付出了代价。每周花一便士买一块草皮。我们的。小的。乞丐。婴儿。没有任何意义。自然的错误。如果它是健康的，那是来自母亲的。如果不是从男人那里。下次好运。

—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It’s well out of it.
——可怜的小东西，迪达勒斯先生说。已经很好了。

The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
马车缓慢地爬上拉特兰广场的山丘。他的骨头嘎嘎作响。越过石头。只是一个穷光蛋。没有人拥有。

—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
——在生活中，马丁·坎宁安说。

—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.
——但鲍尔先生说，最糟糕的是自杀的人。

Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
马丁·坎宁安轻快地掏出手表，咳嗽了一声，又把它放了回去。

—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
——鲍尔先生补充道，这是家庭中最大的耻辱。

—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.
——当然是暂时的精神错乱，马丁·坎宁安斩钉截铁地说。我们必须以慈善的眼光来看待它。

—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
——他们说这样做的人是胆小鬼，迪达勒斯先生说。

—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
——这不是由我们来评判的，马丁·坎宁安说。

Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham’s large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like Shakespeare’s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn’t broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.
布卢姆先生正要说话，又闭上了嘴唇。马丁·坎宁安的大眼睛。现在把目光移开。他是一个富有同情心的人。聪明的。就像莎士比亚的脸一样。总有一句好话要说。他们对这里的杀婴行为毫不留情。拒绝基督教葬礼。他们常常在坟墓里用一根木桩刺穿他的心脏。就好像它还没有被打破一样。但有时他们后悔得太晚了。发现于河床，手握灯心草。他看着我。还有他妻子那个可怕的酒鬼。一次又一次地为她布置房子，然后几乎每周六都把家具典当给他。带领他过着被诅咒的生活。把心从石头里磨出来，就是这样。星期一早上。重新开始。肩膀到方向盘。天哪，那天晚上迪达勒斯告诉我他就在那里时，她一定看到了这样的景象。在这个地方喝醉了，拿着马丁的雨伞跳来跳去。

And they call me the jewel of Asia,
他们称我为亚洲的宝石，

Of Asia,
亚洲的，

The Geisha.
艺伎。

He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
他把目光从我身上移开。他知道。他的骨头嘎嘎作响。

That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.
审讯的那天下午。桌子上有红色标签的瓶子。酒店的房间里有狩猎的照片。很闷。阳光透过百叶窗的板条。验尸官的耳朵被阳光照射，又大又毛。靴子作证。以为他先睡着了。然后看到他脸上有黄色的条纹。已经滑到床脚了。结论：服药过量。因意外而死亡。信。为了我的儿子利奥波德。

No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
不再痛苦了。不再醒来。没有人拥有。

The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
马车沿着布莱辛顿街快速行驶。越过石头。

—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
——我想，我们正在加快步伐，马丁·坎宁安说。

—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
——上帝保佑他在路上没有让我们感到不安，鲍尔先生说。

—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
——我希望不会，马丁·坎宁安说。明天在德国将是一场精彩的比赛。戈登·贝内特.

—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
——是的，天哪，迪达勒斯先生说。这将是值得一看的，信仰。

As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from Saul. He’s as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The Mater Misericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady’s Hospice for the dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.
当他们拐进伯克利街时，盆地附近的一架街头风琴在他们身后传来一阵欢快、嘎嘎作响的大厅歌曲。这里有人见过凯莉吗？ Kay ee double ell wy。扫罗的死亡进行曲。他和老安东尼奥一样糟糕。他让我独自一人。旋转！慈悲圣母。埃克尔斯街。我家就在下面。地方很大。那里有不治之症的病房。非常鼓舞人心。圣母临终关怀医院。死屋在下面很方便。老赖尔登夫人去世的地方。那些女人看起来很糟糕。她的奶杯和勺子擦着嘴。然后在她的床边围上屏风让她死去。漂亮的年轻学生，穿着被蜜蜂咬过的衣服。他已经去了他们告诉我的产科医院。从一个极端到另一个极端。马车疾驰过一个拐角，停了下来。

—What’s wrong now?
——现在怎么了？

A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.
一群群牛群分开，经过窗户，低声哞哞地叫着，无精打采地迈着垫着垫子的蹄子，尾巴慢慢地甩在凝结的骨盆上。羊群在他们外面和他们中间跑来跑去，发出恐惧的咩咩叫声。

—Emigrants, Mr Power said.
——移民，鲍尔先生说。

—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
——呼啊！牧牛人的声音喊道，他的开关在他们的侧翼响起。

Huuuh! out of that!
呵呵！出于那个！

Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.
当然是星期四。明天就是杀戮日。施普林格。卡夫卖给他们每人大约二十七英镑。对于利物浦来说可能是这样。老英格兰的烤牛肉。他们把多汁的都买光了。然后第五季度就输了：所有的原材料，兽皮，头发，角。一年之内发生一件大事。死肉贸易。屠宰场制革厂的副产品、肥皂、人造黄油。不知道现在在克朗西拉的火车上把肉从火车上弄下来是否有效。

The carriage moved on through the drove.
马车在车道上继续前行。

—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.
——我不明白为什么公司不运营从公园门到码头的有轨电车线路，布鲁姆先生说。所有这些动物都可以用卡车运到船上。

—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.
——马丁·坎宁安说，不要堵塞大道。完全正确。他们应该这样做。

—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don’t you see what I mean?
——是的，布鲁姆先生说，而我经常想到的另一件事是，要有像米兰那样的市政葬礼电车，你知道。线路延伸到墓地大门，有特殊的有轨电车、灵车和马车等等。你不明白我的意思吗？

—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon diningroom.
——哦，这该死的故事，迪达勒斯先生说。普尔曼汽车和轿车餐厅。

—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
——鲍尔先生补充道，对老掉牙的监视很差。

—Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?
-为什么？布卢姆先生转向迪达勒斯先生问道。这难道不比两人并肩驰骋更体面吗？

—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
——好吧，这确实有道理，迪达勒斯先生承认。

—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.
——而且，马丁·坎宁安说，当灵车绕过邓菲的棺材翻倒在路上时，我们不会看到这样的场景。

—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!
——太可怕了，鲍尔先生震惊的表情说道，尸体倒在路上。糟糕的！

—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
——第一轮是邓菲的，迪达勒斯先生点点头说道。戈登贝内特杯。

—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
——赞美上帝！马丁·坎宁安虔诚地说。

Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what’s up now. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.
嘭！沮丧的。一口棺材撞到了路上。爆开。帕迪·迪格纳姆跳了出来，在尘土中僵硬地翻滚，穿着一件对他来说太大的棕色服装。红脸：现在变成灰色了。嘴巴张开了。询问现在怎么样了。关闭它是非常正确的。开起来看起来很可怕。然后内部很快分解。最好关闭所有孔口。是的，还有。用蜡。括约肌松弛。全部封印起来。

—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
——邓菲的，马车右转时鲍尔先生宣布。

Dunphy’s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we’ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.
邓菲的角落。哀悼教练列队列队，淹没他们的悲伤。在路边稍作停留。酒吧的顶级位置。预计我们会在回来的路上停下来为他的健康干杯。传递安慰。生命灵丹妙药。

But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose. Depends on where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.
但假设现在它确实发生了。如果钉子在敲打中割伤他，他会流血吗？我想他会，也不会。取决于在哪里。循环停止。还有一些可能会从动脉中渗出。最好用红色埋葬它们：深红色。

In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
他们默默地沿着菲柏斯伯勒路行驶。一辆空灵车从墓地小跑过来：看上去如释重负。

Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.
十字枪桥：皇家运河。

Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.
水流咆哮着冲过水闸。一名男子站在正在下落的驳船上，夹在草皮之间。船闸旁的纤道上有一匹拴得松松垮垮的马。登上布加布号。

Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady’s. Developing waterways. James M’Cann’s hobby to row me o’er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.
他们的眼睛注视着他。在缓慢的杂草丛生的水道上，他乘着木筏向爱尔兰海岸漂流，牵引绳牵引着他经过芦苇丛、粘液、沾满泥的瓶子和腐肉狗。阿斯隆、穆林加尔、莫伊谷，我可以步行游览运河边的米莉。或者循环往下。租个旧瓦罐吧，安全。雷恩前几天在拍卖会上买了一件，但是是一件女士的。发展水路。詹姆斯·麦肯的爱好是划我渡轮。交通更便宜。通过简单的阶段。船屋。外出露营。还有灵车。乘水而上天堂。也许我会不写。莱克斯利普，克朗西拉，给你一个惊喜。一个接一个的下降到都柏林。拥有来自中部沼泽的草皮。礼炮。他举起棕色草帽，向帕迪·迪格南致敬。

They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.
他们开车经过布赖恩·博洛伊姆的房子。现在就在附近。

—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
——我想知道我们的朋友福格蒂过得怎么样，鲍尔先生说。

—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
——最好问问汤姆·克南，迪达勒斯先生说。

—How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
-那个怎么样？马丁·坎宁安说道。我想，让他哭泣吧？

—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
——虽然看不见了，迪达勒斯先生说，亲爱的，记忆犹新。

The carriage steered left for Finglas road.
马车向左驶向芬格拉斯路。

The stonecutter’s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.
右边是石匠的院子。最后一圈。陆地上挤满了沉默的身影，白色的，悲伤的，伸出平静的双手，悲伤地跪下，指着。形状碎片，凿成。在白色的沉默中：吸引人。能得到的最好的。托斯。 H. Dennany，不朽的建造者和雕塑家。

Passed.
通过了。

On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After life’s journey.
教堂司事吉米·吉尔里门前的路边石上，坐着一个老流浪汉，一边咕哝着，一边从打哈欠的巨大灰棕色靴子里倒出泥土和石头。人生旅途结束后。

Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
然后，阴暗的花园一一过去：阴暗的房屋。

Mr Power pointed.
鲍尔先生指出。

—That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
——那就是查尔兹被谋杀的地方，他说。最后的房子。

—So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.
——确实如此，迪达勒斯先生说。一个可怕的案例。西摩·布什让他下车。谋杀了他的兄弟。或者他们是这么说的。

—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
——鲍尔先生说，官方没有证据。

—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That’s the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.
——马丁·坎宁安补充道，这只是间接情况。这是法律的格言。九十九个有罪者逃脱，比一个无辜者被错误定罪要好。

They looked. Murderer’s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder. The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about it. Man’s head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
他们看起来。凶手之地。天黑了。花园紧闭，无人居住，没有杂草。整个地方都变成了地狱。受到错误的谴责。谋杀。被害人眼中的凶手形象。他们喜欢阅读相关内容。在花园里发现的人头。她的衣服包括。她是如何死去的。最近的愤怒。使用的武器。凶手仍然逍遥法外。线索。一条鞋带。尸体待挖掘。谋杀将会出来。

Cramped in this carriage. She mightn’t like me to come that way without letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
挤在这节车厢里。她可能不喜欢我不让她知道就这样过来。对女性一定要小心。抓住他们一次，让他们脱下裤子。以后再也不会原谅你了。十五。

The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.
普罗斯佩克特高高的栏杆在他们的视线中荡漾开来。深色杨树，罕见的白色形式。形状更加频繁，白色的形状聚集在树林中，白色的形状和碎片无声地流动，在空中维持着徒劳的姿态。

The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
小伙子狠狠地撞在路边石上：停了下来。马丁·坎宁安伸出手臂，向后扭动把手，用膝盖把门推开。他走了出去。鲍尔先生和迪达勒斯先生跟在后面。

Change that soap now. Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.
现在就换肥皂吧。布卢姆先生的手迅速解开后袋的纽扣，将粘着纸的肥皂放入手帕内侧的口袋里。他下了马车，将另一只手还握着的报纸放回原处。

Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It’s all the same. Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
微不足道的葬礼：马车和三辆马车。全部都是一样。抬棺者、金缰绳、安魂弥撒、齐射。死亡盛况。后面的马车后面有一个小贩站在他的手推车旁，里面装满了蛋糕和水果。西姆内尔蛋糕是粘在一起的：为死者准备的蛋糕。狗饼干。谁吃了它们？哀悼者出来。

He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
他跟着他的同伴。克南先生和内德·兰伯特跟在后面，海因斯跟在他们后面。科尼·凯莱赫站在打开的灵车旁，取出两个花圈。他递给男孩一张。

Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?
那个孩子的葬礼消失到哪里去了？

A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
一队马从芬格拉斯驶过，拖着一辆嘎吱作响的马车穿过葬礼般的寂静，马车上铺着一块花岗岩。走在他们前面的马车夫敬礼。

Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.
现在棺材。他已经死了，比我们先到了这里。马用歪斜的羽毛环顾四周。目光呆滞：衣领紧紧地套在脖子上，压在血管什么的。他们知道每天在这里运送什么吗？每天肯定有二十或三十场葬礼。然后是新教徒的杰罗姆山。世界各地每分钟都在举行葬礼。快速地把一车车的东西铲到下面。每小时数千。世界上太多了。

Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl’s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.
哀悼者从大门走出来：女人和女孩。瘦下巴的鹰身女妖，讨价还价时的强硬女人，她的帽子歪了。女孩的脸上沾满了污垢和泪水，握住女人的手臂，抬头看着她，示意她哭泣。鱼的脸，毫无血色，铁青。

The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.
哑巴们扛着棺材，把它抬进了大门。这么多自重。从浴缸里出来时，我感觉自己更重了。首先是僵硬的人：然后是僵硬的朋友。科尼·凯莱赫和男孩带着花圈跟在后面。他们旁边那个人是谁？啊，姐夫。

All walked after.
都跟着走了。

Martin Cunningham whispered:
马丁·坎宁安低声说道：

—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
——当你在布鲁姆面前谈论自杀时，我感到极度痛苦。

—What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
-什么？鲍尔先生低声说道。为何如此？

—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the Queen’s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.
——他的父亲服毒自杀了，马丁·坎宁安低声说道。在恩尼斯有女王酒店。你听到他说他要去克莱尔。周年纪念日。

—O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
-哦天啊！鲍尔先生低声说道。我第一次听说它。自己中毒了？

He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum. Speaking.
他回头看了一眼，看到一张带着深沉思考的眼睛的脸正朝着红衣主教的陵墓走去。请讲。

—Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
——他有保险吗？布鲁姆先生问道。

—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
——我相信是这样，克南先生回答道。但该保单被大量抵押。马丁正在努力让这个年轻人进入Artane。

—How many children did he leave?
——他留下了多少个孩子？

—Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.
-五。内德·兰伯特说他会尽力让其中一名女孩进入托德的学校。

—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
——一个悲伤的案例，布卢姆先生温和地说。五个年幼的孩子。

—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
——对可怜的妻子来说是一个巨大的打击，克南先生补充道。

—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
——确实是的，布鲁姆先生同意了。

Has the laugh at him now.
现在已经在嘲笑他了。

He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you’ll soon follow him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.
他低头看着那双被他擦黑擦亮的靴子。她比他活得更久。失去了丈夫。对她来说，比对我来说，死得更多。其中一个必须比另一个更长寿。智者说。世界上女性的数量多于男性。向她表示哀悼。你的损失惨重。我希望你很快就能追随他。仅适用于印度教寡妇。她会嫁给另一个人。他？不。但谁知道之后呢。自从老王后死后，守寡就不再是问题了。画在炮车上。维多利亚和阿尔伯特。弗罗格莫尔纪念馆哀悼。但最后她在帽子里放了几朵紫罗兰。在她的内心深处是虚荣的。一切只为了一个影子。连国王都不是妃子。她的儿子就是实质内容。她希望有一些新的希望，而不是像过去一样，她想要回来，等待。它永远不会到来。一个人必须先走：独自一人，在地下：并且不再躺在她温暖的床上。

—How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’t seen you for a month of Sundays.
——你好吗，西蒙？内德·兰伯特双手合十，轻声说道。已经有一个月没见到你的周日了。

—Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?
-从来没有更好的。科克镇上的人都怎么样？

—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
——复活节星期一我去那里参加科克公园比赛，内德·兰伯特说。还是原来的六便士八便士。与迪克·蒂维停了下来。

—And how is Dick, the solid man?
——迪克这个坚强的人怎么样了？

—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
——他和天堂之间没有任何关系，内德·兰伯特回答道。

—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
——神圣的保罗！迪达勒斯先生带着压抑的惊奇说道。迪克·蒂维秃头了？

—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.
——马丁要为年轻人挥起鞭子，内德·兰伯特指着前方说道。几个鲍勃头骨。只是为了让他们继续下去，直到保险结清为止。

—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
——是的，是的，迪达勒斯先生半信半疑地说。是前面那个最大的男孩吗？

—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.
——是的，内德·兰伯特说，和妻子的兄弟一起。约翰·亨利·门顿落后。他写下自己的名字换取一英镑。

—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
——我会同意他这么做的，迪达勒斯先生说。我经常告诉可怜的帕迪他应该介意那份工作。约翰·亨利并不是世界上最糟糕的。

—How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
——他是怎么失去的？内德·兰伯特问道。酒，什么？

—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
——这都是好人的错，迪达勒斯先生叹了口气说。

They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O’Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?
他们在太平间教堂门口停了下来。布卢姆先生站在男孩身后，戴着花环，低头看着他梳理得光滑的头发，还有他崭新的衣领内细长、布满皱纹的脖子。可怜的孩子！当父亲的时候他在吗？两人都无意识。最后一刻放轻松，最后一次认清。他可能已经做了这一切。我欠奥格雷迪三先令。他会明白吗？哑巴们把棺材抬进教堂。他的头是哪一端？

After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
过了一会儿，他跟着其他人走了进来，在屏幕的灯光下眨着眼睛。棺材放在圣坛前的棺材上，四角放着四支高高的黄色蜡烛。永远在我们面前。科尼·凯莱赫在每个前角都献上了花圈，示意男孩跪下。哀悼者跪在祷告台上。布卢姆先生站在后面靠近圣水池的地方，当所有人都跪下时，他小心地从口袋里拿出展开的报纸，然后把右膝盖跪在上面。他将黑色帽子轻轻地戴在左膝上，然后握住帽檐，虔诚地弯下腰。

A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly. Who’ll read the book? I, said the rook.
一名服务员端着一个铜桶，里面装着什么东西，从门里走了出来。穿着白袍的牧师跟在他后面，用一只手整理他的圣带，另一只手在蟾蜍肚子上放着一本小书。谁会读这本书？我，车说。

They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.
他们在棺材旁停下来，牧师开始用流利的嘶哑声朗读他的书。

Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. Domine-namine. Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.
科菲神父。我知道他的名字就像一口棺材。多米尼米。欺负他看起来的枪口。老板们看秀。肌肉发达的基督徒。任何对他有斜视的人都有祸了：牧师。你是彼得。像三叶草中的绵羊一样向侧面爆发，德达勒斯说他会的。他的肚子就像一只中毒的小狗。人类发现的最有趣的表达方式。嗯：横向爆发。

—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.
——非司法和伺服陀，多明。

Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you’re a goner.
让他们觉得用拉丁语为他们祈祷更重要。安魂曲弥撒。绉纱哭泣者。黑边信纸。祭坛名单上有你的名字。寒冷的地方这个。想要吃得好，整个早上都坐在那儿，在昏暗中踢着脚跟等待下一个请。也是蟾蜍的眼睛。是什么让他膨胀成这样？莫莉吃了卷心菜后就肿了。也许是这个地方的空气。看起来充满了不良气体。这地方一定充满了恶毒的气体。例如，屠夫：他们就像生牛排。谁告诉我的？默文·布朗。在圣维尔堡一百五十座可爱的旧管风琴的墓穴里，有时他们必须在棺材上钻一个洞，以排出有害气体并将其燃烧。它冲出来：蓝色。闻一闻，你就完蛋了。

My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That’s better.
我的膝盖骨很痛。噢。这样更好。

The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before you rested. It’s all written down: he has to do it.
牧师从男孩的桶里拿出一根末端有把手的棍子，在棺材上摇晃。然后他走到另一端，再次摇了摇。然后他回来把它放回桶里。就像你休息之前一样。一切都写下来了：他必须这样做。

—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.
——Et ne nos inducas in tentationem。

The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course …
服务员用高音发出了答案。我常常想，最好有男仆。最多十五个左右。之后，当然……

Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows’ breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.
我想那是圣水。摇晃睡眠。他一定厌倦了那份工作，在他们小跑过来的所有尸体上摇晃那东西。如果他能看到他正在摇晃的东西，那会有什么坏处呢？每个凡人的每一天都会有一批新的人：中年男子、老妇人、儿童、难产妇女、留着胡子的男人、光头商人、小麻雀胸的肺痨女孩。一年到头，他都为他们祈祷同样的事情，并在他们身上摇水：睡觉。现在在迪格纳姆。

—In paradisum.
——在天堂。

Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
说他要去天堂或者正在天堂里。对所有人都这么说。一种很累人的工作。但他必须说点什么。

The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
神父合上书就走了，服务员也跟着走了。科尼·凯莱赫打开侧门，掘墓人进来，再次举起棺材，搬出去，推到车上。科尼·凯莱赫给男孩送了一个花圈，给姐夫送了一个花圈。所有人都跟着他们走出侧门，进入温和的灰色空气中。布卢姆先生最后到了，把他的报纸重新折进口袋里。他严肃地注视着地面，直到棺材车向左转去。金属轮子碾碎碎石，发出刺耳的刺耳叫声，一群钝靴子跟着拖着的手推车沿着坟墓小道行进。

The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.
雷雷雷雷雷雷雷罗。主啊，我不能在这里轻快地说。

—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
——奥康奈尔圈子，迪达勒斯先生这样评价他。

Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.
鲍尔先生温柔的目光上升到了高高的圆锥体的顶端。

—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!
——老丹·奥，他说，他在他的人民中间休息。但他的心却埋在罗马。这里埋葬了多少破碎的心，西蒙！

—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
——她的坟墓就在那里，杰克，迪达勒斯先生说。我很快就会在她身边舒展身体。只要他愿意，就让他带我去吧。

Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
他崩溃了，开始悄悄地哭泣，走路也有点绊倒。鲍尔先生挽住了他的手臂。

—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.
——她现在的处境更好，他和善地说。

—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.
——我想是的，迪达勒斯先生微弱地喘着气说道。我想如果有天堂的话她就在天堂了。

Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.
科尼·凯莱赫退到一边，让哀悼者缓慢地走过。

—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
——在悲伤的时刻，克南先生礼貌地开始说道。

Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
布卢姆先生闭上眼睛，悲伤地两次低下了头。

—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
——其他人都戴上了帽子，克南先生说。我想我们也可以这样做。我们是最后一个。这个墓地是一个危险的地方。

They covered their heads.
他们捂住了头。

—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.
——尊敬的先生读完礼拜仪式的速度太快了，你不觉得吗？克南先生责备地说。

Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the last. In the same boat. Hope he’ll say something else.
布卢姆先生看着那双充满血丝的眼睛，严肃地点点头。秘密的眼睛，秘密的搜索。梅森，我想：不确定。又到了他身边。我们是最后一个。在同一条船里。希望他能说点别的。

Mr Kernan added:
克南先生补充道：

—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.
——我必须说，杰罗姆山使用的爱尔兰教堂的服务更简单，更令人印象深刻。

Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
布鲁姆先生谨慎地同意了。当然，语言是另一回事。

Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
克南先生郑重地说：

—I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man’s inmost heart.
——我是复活，我是生命。这触动了男人的内心深处。

—It does, Mr Bloom said.
——确实如此，布鲁姆先生说。

Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.
也许你会心动，但是这个六英尺乘二英尺、脚趾踩着雏菊的家伙要付出什么代价呢？不许碰那个。感情之座。破碎的心。毕竟是一个泵，每天泵送数千加仑的血液。有一天天气晴朗，它被堵住了：你就在那里。很多都躺在这里：肺、心脏、肝脏。生锈的旧泵：该死的其他东西。复活和生命。一旦你死了，你就死了。最后一天的想法。把他们都从坟墓里打出来。出来吧，拉撒路！结果他排名第五，丢掉了工作。起床！最后一天！然后每个人都在四处寻找他的肝脏、他的灯光和其他陷阱。那天早上他发现自己完全崩溃了。头骨里有一便士重量的粉末。十二克一便士。特洛伊测量。

Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
科尼·凯莱赫跟在他们身边。

—Everything went off A1, he said. What?
——一切都偏离了A1，他说。什么？

He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman’s shoulders. With your tooraloom tooraloom.
他用那双慢吞吞的眼睛看着他们。警察的肩膀。与您的tooraloom tooraloom。

—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
——应该如此，克南先生说。

—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
-什么？呃？科尼·凯莱赫说道。

Mr Kernan assured him.
克南先生向他保证。

—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I know his face.
——汤姆·克南身后那个人是谁？约翰·亨利·门顿问道。我认识他的脸。

Ned Lambert glanced back.
内德·兰伯特回头看了一眼。

—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano. She’s his wife.
——布卢姆，他说，马里昂·特威迪夫人，我是说，她过去是、现在是女高音。她是他的妻子。

—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven’t seen her for some time. he was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.
——哦，当然，约翰·亨利·门顿说。我有一段时间没见到她了。他是一个漂亮的女人。我和她一起跳舞，等等，十五十七年前，在圆镇的马特·狄龙舞厅。她是一个很好的拥抱者。

He looked behind through the others.
他透过其他人向后看去。

—What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
-他是什么？他问。他做什么的？他不是在文具店排队吗？我记得有一天晚上，我在保龄球比赛中与他发生了冲突。

Ned Lambert smiled.
内德·兰伯特笑了。

—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s. A traveller for blottingpaper.
——是的，他说，他在威斯德姆·赫利家。吸墨纸的旅行者。

—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.
——以上帝的名义，约翰·亨利·门顿说，她嫁给这样的浣熊是为了什么？那时她有很多游戏。

—Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
——仍然如此，内德·兰伯特说。他为广告做一些拉票工作。

John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.
约翰·亨利·门顿的大眼睛凝视着前方。

The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
手推车拐进了一条小巷。一个埋伏在草丛中的肥胖男子举起帽子表示敬意。掘墓人摸了摸帽子。

—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
——约翰·奥康奈尔，鲍尔先生高兴地说。他永远不会忘记一个朋友。

Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
奥康奈尔先生默默地与大家握手。迪达勒斯先生说：

—I am come to pay you another visit.
——我又来拜访你了。

—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don’t want your custom at all.
——亲爱的西蒙，看门人低声回答道。我根本不想要你的习惯。

Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.
他向内德·兰伯特和约翰·亨利·门顿致敬，走在马丁·坎宁安身边，困惑着他背后的两把长钥匙。

—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?
——他问他们，你们听说过关于库姆号马尔卡希的事吗？

—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
——我没有，马丁·坎宁安说。

They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
他们一致地弯下丝质帽子，海因斯侧过耳朵。看门人将拇指挂在金表链的环上，对他们空洞的微笑用谨慎的语气说道。

—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
——他说，他们讲了一个故事，一个大雾的夜晚，两个醉汉来到这里寻找他们一位朋友的坟墓。他们向库姆号索要马尔卡希，并被告知他被埋在哪里。在雾中摸索后，他们果然找到了坟墓。一名醉汉拼出了这个名字：特伦斯·马尔卡希。另一个醉汉正眨着眼睛看着寡妇竖起的救世主雕像。

The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:
看门人看着他们经过的一处坟墓，眨了眨眼睛。他继续说道：

—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the man, says he. That’s not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.
——而且，在对这个神圣的人物眨了眨眼之后，他说，一点也不像这个人。他说，那不是马尔卡希，不管是谁干的。

Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.
得到微笑后，他向后退了一步，与科尼·凯莱赫交谈，接受了给他的案卷，一边走一边翻过来扫描它们。

—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.
——这一切都是有目的的，马丁·坎宁安向海因斯解释道。

—I know, Hynes said. I know that.
——我知道，海因斯说。我知道。

—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.
——马丁·坎宁安说，为了让一个人高兴起来。这是纯粹的善意：其他的都该死。

Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. All want to be on good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort. Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. Habeas corpus. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it’s not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That’s the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death … Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o’ the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they’d kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.
布卢姆先生很欣赏看守人丰硕的身材。大家都想和他搞好关系。约翰·奥康奈尔，一个正派的家伙，真正的好人。凯斯：就像凯斯的广告一样：不用担心有人出去。没有通行检查。人身保护令。葬礼结束后我必须看看那则广告。当她打扰我给玛莎写信时，我是否在信封上写了“鲍尔斯布里奇”？希望它不会被扔进死信办公室。剃须效果更好。灰色的胡须长了出来。这是头发变白的第一个迹象。而且脾气越来越暴躁。银线穿插在灰色之中。想成为他的妻子。奇怪他有向任何女孩求婚的勇气。出来住墓地。把它挂在她面前。这可能首先让她兴奋。找死……夜色笼罩着这里，所有的死者都四肢伸展。当墓地打哈欠时，坟墓的阴影和丹尼尔·奥康奈尔一定是后裔，我想这是谁，过去常说他是一个奇怪的品种男人，伟大的天主教徒，但就像黑暗中的大巨人一样。会吗？坟墓之气。想让她完全不去想怀孕的事。尤其是女人，是那么的敏感。在床上给她讲鬼故事哄她睡觉。你见过鬼吗？嗯，我有。那是一个漆黑的夜晚。时钟敲响了十二点。不过，如果情绪适当的话，他们还是会接吻的。土耳其墓地里的妓女。年轻的时候就可以学到任何东西。你可能会在这里遇见一位年轻的寡妇。男人都这样。墓碑间的爱。罗密欧。快乐的香料。在死亡之中，我们还活着。两端相遇。对可怜的死者来说很诱人。烤牛排的香味让饥饿的人垂涎欲滴。啃噬着他们的要害。欲愚弄人。莫莉想在窗口做这件事。无论如何，他有八个孩子。

He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t. Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.
在他的一生中，他目睹了相当一部分的失败，在他身边一片又一片地躺着。圣地。如果他们站着埋的话会有更多的空间。坐着或跪着你都做不到。常设？有一天，他的头可能会在山体滑坡中伸出地面，并用手指向。所有蜂窝状的地面一定是：长方形的蜂窝。他也把它保持得非常整洁：修剪草坪和边缘。甘布尔少校的花园被称为杰罗姆山。嗯，确实如此。应该是睡眠之花。马斯蒂安斯基告诉我，中国的墓地里种植着巨大的罂粟花，出产最好的鸦片。植物园就在那里。是沉入大地的血液赋予了新的生命。他们所说的那些犹太人杀死了基督徒男孩也是同样的想法。每个人都有他的价格。保存完好的肥尸，绅士，美食家，果园无价之宝。很划算。威廉·威尔金森（William Wilkinson）的尸体，审计员兼会计师，最近去世，体重三磅十三又六磅。带着感谢。

I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.
我敢说，土壤一定很肥沃，里面有尸粪、骨头、肉、指甲。停尸房。可怕。变绿并分解呈粉红色。在潮湿的土壤中腐烂得很快。瘦老的更坚韧。然后是一种牛油般的奶酪味。然后开始有黑色的、黑色的糖蜜从里面渗出来。然后就干了。死蛾。当然，细胞或其他任何东西都会继续存活。改变一下。实际上永远活下去。没有什么可以靠自己吃饭的。

But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least. De mortuis nil nisi prius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.
但它们一定会培育出大量蛆虫的恶魔。土壤一定只是与它们一起旋转。你的头简直在旋转。那些漂亮的海边小女孩。他看起来对此很高兴。看到其他人先倒下，他有一种力量感。想知道他如何看待生活。还开着玩笑：温暖了他的心。关于公告的那一则。司布真今天凌晨 4 点去了天堂。晚上11点（关闭时间）。还没到。彼得.死者本身，男人无论如何都想听一个奇怪的笑话，或者女人想知道流行什么。多汁的梨子或女士潘趣酒，辛辣、浓郁、甜美。远离潮湿。有时你必须笑，所以最好就这样笑。哈姆雷特中的掘墓人。展现了人心的博大精深的学问。至少两年内不敢拿死者开玩笑。死后不死。先去哀悼吧。很难想象他的葬礼。看起来像是一个笑话。阅读你自己的讣告，他们说你活得更长。给你第二次喘息。新的生命。

—How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
——明天你有多少？看门人问道。

—Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
——两个，科尼·凯莱赫说。十点半和十一点。

The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
管理员把文件放进口袋里。手推车已经停止滚动了。哀悼者们分开，移到洞的两侧，小心翼翼地绕过坟墓。掘墓人抬着棺材，把它的鼻子放在边缘上，用带子把它围起来。

Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn’t know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.
把他埋葬了。我们是来埋葬凯撒的。他三月或六月的日子。他不知道谁在这里，也不关心。那边那个穿着麦金塔电脑、看起来瘦长的加洛特是谁？现在我想知道他是谁？现在我想稍微了解一下他是谁。总会有一个你做梦也想不到的人出现。一个人可以孤独终老。是的，他可以。尽管他可以自己挖坟墓，但死后他还是得找人给他盖上草皮。大家都这样做。只有人类才能埋葬。不，还有蚂蚁。第一件事让任何人印象深刻。埋葬死者。说鲁宾逊漂流记是真实的。那么星期五就埋葬了他。如果你来看的话，每个周五都埋藏着一个周四。

O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
噢，可怜的鲁宾逊漂流记！

How could you possibly do so?
你怎么可能这样做？

Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s. They’re so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The Irishman’s house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.
可怜的迪格纳姆！他在地球上的最后一次躺在他的盒子里。当你想到所有这些时，你会觉得这确实是浪费木材。都被啃烂了。他们可以发明一种漂亮的棺材，带有一种可滑动的面板，以这种方式放下。是的，但他们可能会反对被埋在另一个人的坟墓之外。他们是如此特别。让我安息在我的故乡土地上。来自圣地的一小块粘土。只有一位母亲和死去的孩子被埋在同一个棺材里。我明白这意味着什么了。我懂了。即使在地球上也要尽可能长久地保护他。爱尔兰人的房子就是他的棺材。在地下墓穴中进行防腐处理，木乃伊也有同样的想法。

Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I’m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death’s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn’t in the chapel, that I’ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
布卢姆先生站在后面，手里拿着帽子，数着光着脑袋的人。十二。我十三岁了。不，使用麦金塔电脑的小伙子十三岁。死亡号码。他到底是从哪里冒出来的？我发誓他不在教堂里。关于十三的愚蠢迷信。

Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It’s dyed. His wife I forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.
内德·兰伯特 (Ned Lambert) 的那套西装采用了漂亮柔软的花呢面料。带有紫色调。当我们住在朗伯德街西时，我有一个这样的。他曾经是一个衣着讲究的人。以前一天换三套衣服。必须让梅西亚斯把我的那套灰色衣服变成衣服。你好。是染色的。他的妻子我忘了他还没有结婚，否则他的女房东应该为他挑选这些线索。

The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
棺材潜入看不见的地方，被跨坐在墓碑上的人缓缓放下。他们挣扎着爬了出来：但都没有被遮盖。二十。

Pause.
暂停。

If we were all suddenly somebody else.
如果我们突然都变成了另外一个人。

Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
远处传来驴子的叫声。雨。没有这样的屁股。他们说，永远不要看到死人。羞耻死了。他们隐藏起来。可怜的爸爸也走了。

Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It’s the moment you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can’t believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven’t yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall i nevermore behold thee? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you. Don’t forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.
柔和甜美的空气低声地吹过他们裸露的脑袋。耳语。墓碑旁的男孩双手捧着花圈，静静地凝视着漆黑的空地。布卢姆先生走到肥胖而和善的看门人身后。剪裁精良的礼服外套。也许权衡一下，看看接下来会选择哪一个。嗯，这是一个漫长的休息。不再有感觉了。这就是你感受到的那一刻。一定很不愉快。一开始不敢相信。错误一定是：别人。试试对面的房子。等等，我想。我还没有。然后死亡室一片漆黑。他们想要的光。在你身边窃窃私语。你想见牧师吗？然后就开始闲逛、徘徊。你一生所隐藏的一切都陷入了谵妄。殊死搏斗。他的睡眠不自然。按下他的下眼睑。看的是他的鼻子尖了，他的下巴下沉了，他的脚底板黄了。把枕头拉开，把它扔在地板上，因为他注定要失败。罪人死亡的照片中的魔鬼向他展示了一个女人。恨不得穿着衬衫拥抱她。露西亚的最后一幕。难道我就再也见不到你了吗？嘭！他过期了。终于走了人们谈论你时会说：忘了你。别忘了为他祈祷。在你的祈祷中记住他。甚至帕内尔。常春藤日即将消亡。然后他们跟着：一个接一个地掉进洞里。

We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you’re well and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.
我们现在正在祈祷他的灵魂安息。希望你一切都好，不要下地狱。换换空气真好。走出生命的煎锅，进入炼狱之火。

Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy’s warning. Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.
他有没有想过等待自己的就是那个洞？他们说，当你在阳光下瑟瑟发抖时，你就会这么做。有人从上面走过。呼叫男孩的警告。在你旁边。我的那块地是我买的，朝向芬格拉斯（Finglas）。妈妈，可怜的妈妈，还有小鲁迪。

The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.
掘墓人拿起铁锹，把厚重的土块扔到棺材上。布卢姆先生转过脸去。如果他一直活着呢？哇！天哪，那太糟糕了！不，不：他当然死了。他当然死了。周一他去世了。他们应该有一些法律来刺穿心脏并确保棺材里有一个电钟或一部电话以及某种帆布气孔。遇险旗帜。三天。在夏天保存它们的时间相当长。一旦你确定没有，就最好将它们关闭。

The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
粘土变得更软。开始被遗忘。眼不见，心不烦。

The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.
看门人退开几步，戴上帽子。受够了。哀悼者一一领受恩宠，不露声色地遮盖自己。布卢姆先生戴上帽子，看到这个肥胖的身影灵巧地穿过迷宫般的坟墓。他安静地、确信自己的立场，穿过荒凉的田野。

Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.
海因斯在笔记本上记下了一些东西。啊，名字。但他全都认识。不：来找我。

—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your christian name? I’m not sure.
——我只是记下名字，海因斯低声说道。你的基督教名字是什么？我不知道。

—L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M’Coy’s name too. He asked me to.
——L，布卢姆先生说。利奥波德.你也可以记下麦考伊的名字。他要求我这么做。

—Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once.
——查理，海因斯在写作中说道。我知道。他曾经登上过弗里曼号。

So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you’re my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I saw to that, M’Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.
在他在路易斯·伯恩手下的太平间找到工作之前，他也是如此。对医生进行尸检是个好主意。找出他们想象中的知识。他于星期二去世。跑了。靠着一些广告的现金。查理，你是我的宝贝。这就是他要求我这么做的原因。哦，好吧，没有坏处。我做到了，麦考伊。谢谢老伙计：非常感谢。让他承担义务：不需要任何成本。

—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the …
——告诉我们，海因斯说，你知道那个家伙在那个那个家伙在那儿吗……

He looked around.
他看了看周围。

—Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
——麦金塔电脑。是的，我看到他了，布鲁姆先生说。他现在在哪儿？

—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don’t know who he is. Is that his name?
——M’Intosh，海因斯潦草地说道。我不知道他是谁。这是他的名字吗？

He moved away, looking about him.
他走开了，环顾四周。

—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
——不，布卢姆先生开始说道，然后转身停了下来。我说，海因斯！

Didn’t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, what became of him?
没听见。什么？他消失到哪里去了？不是一个迹象。好吧，所有的。这里有人看过吗？凯伊双埃尔。变得隐形。天哪，他怎么样了？

A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
第七个掘墓人走到布鲁姆先生旁边，拿起一把闲置的铲子。

—O, excuse me!
——哦，对不起！

He stepped aside nimbly.
他敏捷地退到一边。

Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.
洞里开始出现棕色、潮湿的粘土。它上升了。快结束了。一堆潮湿的土块又升起来，升起来，掘墓人放下了他们的铲子。有那么一会儿，一切都再次被揭开。男孩把他的花环靠在角落里：姐夫在他的肿块上。掘墓人戴上帽子，拿着土铲走向手推车。然后用刀片在草皮上轻轻敲击：干净。有人弯腰从茎上拔下一簇长草。其中一个离开了他的同伴，肩上扛着武器，缓慢地走着，刀刃闪着蓝光。另一个人在墓地默默地盘着棺材带。他的脐带。姐夫转过身去，把一样东西放在他空着的手里。默默道谢。对不起，先生：麻烦了。摇头。我知道。只为你们自己。

The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.
送葬者们漫无目的地慢慢走开，沿着蜿蜒的小路，时不时地停留在坟墓上念名字。

—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said. We have time.
——我们去酋长的坟墓旁转一圈吧，海因斯说。我们有时间。

—Let us, Mr Power said.
——让我们吧，鲍尔先生说。

They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke:
他们向右转，跟随缓慢的思绪。鲍尔先生用茫然的声音带着敬畏说道：

—Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.
——有人说他根本不在那个坟墓里。棺材里装满了石头。总有一天他会再来。

Hynes shook his head.
海因斯摇摇头。

—Parnell will never come again, he said. He’s there, all that was mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.
——帕内尔再也不会来了，他说。他就在那里，他的一切都是凡人。愿他的骨灰安息。

Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls’ day. Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death’s door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman’s with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren’s. The great physician called him home. Well it’s God’s acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.
布鲁姆先生沿着他的小树林走着，周围有悲伤的天使、十字架、折断的柱子、家庭墓穴、仰视祈祷的石头希望、古老爱尔兰的心和手，无人理睬。更明智的做法是把钱花在一些为生者做的慈善事业上。祈求灵魂安息。真的有人吗？种植他并结束他。就像落下煤矿一样。然后将它们集中在一起以节省时间。万灵节。二十七号我会去他的坟墓。十先令给园丁。他让它没有杂草。老人本人。弯下腰，用剪刀剪断。临近死亡之门。谁去世了。谁离开了这一生。就好像他们自愿这么做一样。所有人都被推了。谁踢了桶。如果他们告诉你它们是什么，那就更有趣了。某某，车匠。我去旅行是为了软木油毡。我付了五先令的英镑。或者一个女人拿着她的平底锅。我煮的爱尔兰炖菜很好吃。乡村墓地里的悼词应该是华兹华斯或托马斯·坎贝尔的诗。新教徒说，进入休息状态了。老穆伦医生的。伟大的医生叫他回家。好吧，这是上帝给他们的土地。不错的乡村住宅。新抹灰和油漆。安静抽烟、阅读《教堂时报》的理想场所。他们从不试图美化婚姻广告。生锈的花环挂在把手上，是铜箔做的花环。物有所值。不过，花还是更有诗意。另一个变得相当令人厌烦，但永远不会枯萎。没有表达任何东西。蜡菊。

A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him. Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
一只小鸟温驯地栖息在杨树枝上。就像塞满了一样。就像胡珀市议员送给我们的结婚礼物一样。呼！他一动不动。知道没有弹射器可以向他发射。死去的动物更悲伤。傻米莉把那只死鸟埋在厨房的火柴盒里，坟墓上还埋着一串菊花链和一些破损的链子。

The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.
圣心就是：展示它。袖子上的心。应该是侧面的，红色的，应该画得像一颗真正的心。爱尔兰致力于此或其他什么。看起来一点也不高兴。为什么要受这样的折磨呢？鸟儿会像提着篮子水果的男孩一样过来啄食吗？但他拒绝了，因为它们应该害怕这个男孩。阿波罗就是这样。

How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As you are now so once were we.
多少！所有这些人都曾在都柏林周围行走过。忠实的离开了。你现在是这样，我们曾经也是这样。

Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.
再说你怎么能记住每个人？眼睛、走路、声音。嗯，声音，是的：留声机。每个坟墓里都有一台留声机，或者把它放在家里。周日晚饭后。穿上可怜的老曾祖父。克拉拉克！你好你好你好阿玛夫非常高兴克拉克非常高兴再次看到你好你好阿玛夫 krpthsth。让你想起声音，就像照片让你想起脸一样。否则十五年后你就记不住这张脸了。比如说谁？例如，当我在智慧海利的时候，有一个人死了。

Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!
嗯嗯！鹅卵石的嘎嘎声。等待。停止！

He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.
他低头专注地看着一座石墓。一些动物。等待。他就到了。

An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace for treasure.
一只肥胖的灰老鼠沿着墓穴的一侧蹒跚而行，移动着鹅卵石。一位老舞台表演者：曾祖父：他深谙其中的道理。灰色的活物把自己压在底座下面，又在底座下面蠕动着。宝藏的好藏身之处。

Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he? Making his rounds.
谁住在那里？安放着罗伯特·埃默里的遗体。罗伯特·埃米特被火炬光埋葬在这里，不是吗？巡视。

Tail gone now.
现在尾巴不见了。

One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. Well and what’s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can’t bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn’t be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before he’s well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn’t care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.
其中一个家伙很快就能干掉一个家伙。不管是谁，都把骨头剔干净。对他们来说就是普通的肉。尸体是变质的肉。那么奶酪是什么？牛奶的尸体。我在《中国之旅》中读到，中国人说白人闻起来像尸体。火葬比较好。牧师们极力反对。为另一家公司进行魔鬼交易。批发燃烧器和荷兰烤箱经销商。瘟疫时期。生石灰发烧了就吃它们。致命室。尘归尘。或者海葬。帕西人的寂静之塔在哪里？被鸟吃掉了。土、火、水。他们说溺水是最愉快的。瞬间看到你的一生。但复活没有。但不能埋在空气中。从飞行器中出来。不知道每当新人失望时新闻就会报道。地下通讯。我们从他们那里学到了这一点。不会感到惊讶。定期为它们提供方形饲料。他还没死，苍蝇就来了。听到了迪格纳姆的风声。他们不会关心它的气味。盐白色的碎尸泥：气味、味道都像生白萝卜。

The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.
大门在前面闪闪发光：仍然开着。再次回到人世间。这个地方够了。每次都让你离你更近一点。上次我来这里是为了西尼科夫人的葬礼。爸爸也很可怜。那种杀人的爱。甚至在晚上用灯笼刮土，就像我读到的那样，为了找到刚埋葬的女性，甚至是因墓疮而腐烂的女性。过一会儿让你感到毛骨悚然。死后我会出现在你面前。死后你会看到我的鬼魂。我的鬼魂死后会缠着你。人死后还有另一个世界，名叫地狱。我不喜欢她写的另一个世界。我不再这样做了。还有很多东西可以看到、听到和感受到。感受你身边温暖的生命。让他们睡在生蛆的床上吧。这局他们不会让我得到的。温暖的床铺：温暖的热血生活。

Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
马丁·坎宁安从一条小路上走出来，严肃地说着。

Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office. Mat Dillon’s long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.
我想，律师。我认识他的脸。约翰·亨利·门顿 (Menton, John Henry)，律师，宣誓和宣誓书专员。迪格纳姆曾经在他的办公室里。马特·狄龙很久以前了。乔利·马特。欢乐的夜晚。冷禽、雪茄、坦塔罗斯眼镜。真是金子般的心。是的，芒通。那天晚上在保龄球果岭上把他的破布拿出来，因为我在他体内航行。纯粹是我的侥幸：偏见。为什么他对我如此厌恶。第一眼就讨厌。莫莉和弗洛伊·狄龙在紫丁香树下相连，有说有笑。伙计们总是这样，如果有女人在旁边，就会感到羞愧。

Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
他帽子的一侧有一道凹痕。大概是包车吧

—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.
——对不起，先生，布卢姆先生在他们旁边说道。

They stopped.
他们停了下来。

—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.
——你的帽子有点压扁了，布卢姆先生指着说。

John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
约翰·亨利·门顿盯着他看了一会儿，一动不动。

—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.
——马丁·坎宁安也帮忙指点。约翰·亨利·门顿摘下帽子，鼓起帽子，小心地抚平衣袖上的绒毛。他又把帽子戴在头上。

—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.
——现在没事了，马丁·坎宁安说。

John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.
约翰·亨利·门顿猛地低下头表示感谢。

—Thank you, he said shortly.
——谢谢你，他简短地说。

They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.
他们继续朝大门走去。布卢姆先生垂头丧气地向后退了几步，以免听到。马丁制定了法律。马丁可以在他没看见的情况下，把这样一个傻瓜绕在他的小指上。

Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.
牡蛎眼。没关系。也许等他明白了之后再道歉。就这样拉住他。

Thank you. How grand we are this morning!
谢谢。今天早上我们多么伟大啊！

IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
位于希伯尼安大都市的中心

Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross. The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off:
在纳尔逊的柱式电车减速、分流、换车之前，出发前往 Blackrock、Kingstown 和 Dalkey、Clonskea、Rathgar 和 Terenure、Palmerston Park 和 Upper Rathmines、Sandymount Green、Rathmines、Ringsend 和 Sandymount Tower、Harold’s Cross。都柏林联合有轨电车公司的计时员声音嘶哑地大声斥责他们：

—Rathgar and Terenure!
——拉思加和特雷努尔！

—Come on, Sandymount Green!
——来吧，桑迪芒特格林！

Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.
左右平行的叮当声响起，一辆双层列车和一辆单层列车从它们的轨头驶出，转向下行，平行滑行。

—Start, Palmerston Park!
——开始吧，帕默斯顿公园！

THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
王冠的佩戴者

Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished. Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.
在邮局总局的门廊下，擦鞋匠们正在打电话擦鞋。停在北王子街上的国王陛下的朱红色邮车，两侧刻有皇家缩写“E.R.”，接收着一袋袋信件、明信片、信件卡、包裹，投保并付款，用于当地、省、英国和海外投递。

GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
媒体先生们

Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince’s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s stores.
穿着大靴子的马车夫把沉闷的木桶从普林斯的商店里滚出来，然后把它们撞到啤酒厂的花车上。啤酒厂的花车上，穿着粗靴的马车夫从普林斯的商店里滚出的木桶发出沉闷的撞击声。

—There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.
——就是这样，雷德·穆雷说。亚历山大·凯斯。

—Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to the Telegraph office.
——把它剪掉吧，好吗？布鲁姆先生说，我会把它转给《电讯报》办公室。

The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.
拉特利奇办公室的门再次嘎吱作响。戴维·斯蒂芬斯穿着一件宽大的斗篷大衣，小卷发上戴着一顶小毡帽，昏倒了，斗篷下藏着一卷文件，是一位国王的信使。

Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.
雷德·默里的长剪子利落地四下就把报纸上的广告剪了下来。剪刀和粘贴。

—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.
——我要检查一下印刷厂，布卢姆先生一边说，一边拿着切好的正方形。

—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.
——当然，如果他想要一个标准杆，雷德·穆雷认真地说，他把一支笔放在耳后，我们可以给他一个。

—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I’ll rub that in.
——好吧，布鲁姆先生点点头说道。我会把它擦进去。

We.
我们。

WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
威廉·布雷登 (WILLIAM BRAYDEN)，来自桑迪蒙特奥克兰的绅士

Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered:
雷德·默里用剪刀触碰布卢姆先生的手臂，低声说道：

—Brayden.
——布雷登。

Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the Weekly Freeman and National Press and the Freeman’s Journal and National Press. Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back ascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.
布卢姆先生转过身来，看到身穿制服的搬运工举起了他的字母帽，一个庄严的人物走进了《自由曼周刊》和《国家新闻报》以及《自由曼日报和国家新闻报》的新闻版之间。吉尼斯黑啤酒桶发出沉闷的声音。它由一把雨伞引导着，庄重地走上楼梯，脸上留着胡须，表情严肃。呢绒背板每一步都上升：向后。西蒙·迪达勒斯说，他所有的大脑都在颈背上。他身后有一道道血肉痕迹。颈部脂肪褶皱，脂肪，颈部，脂肪，颈部。

—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.
——你不觉得他的脸像我们的救世主吗？红穆雷低声说道。

The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree. They always build one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.
拉特利奇办公室的门低声响起：ee：cree。他们总是在另一扇门对面建一扇门，以便风吹进去。进来，出去。

Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha. Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.
我们的救世主：留着胡须的椭圆形脸：在黄昏中说话。玛丽，玛莎。男高音马里奥被一把伞剑引导到脚灯处。

—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.
——或者像马里奥一样，布鲁姆先生说。

—Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.
——是的，雷德·默里同意了。但据说马里奥是我们救世主的照片。

Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his heart. In Martha.
耶稣马里奥脸颊红肿，双腿粗壮。把手放在他的心口上。在玛莎.

Co-ome thou lost one,
来吧，你失去了一个，

Co-ome thou dear one!
亲爱的，来吧！

THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
克罗泽尔和钢笔

—His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.
——今天早上，陛下打来了两次电话，雷德·默里严肃地说。

They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.
他们看着膝盖、腿、靴子消失。脖子。

A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word:
一个电报员敏捷地走了进来，把一个信封扔到柜台上，匆匆走下，说了一句话：

—Freeman!
——弗里曼！

Mr Bloom said slowly:
布卢姆先生缓缓说道：

—Well, he is one of our saviours also.
——嗯，他也是我们的救世主之一。

A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation? Thumping. Thumping.
当他抬起挡板，穿过侧门，沿着温暖黑暗的楼梯和通道，沿着现在回响的木板走进去时，脸上带着温顺的微笑。但他会拯救流通吗？怦。怦。

He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti’s reading closet.
他推开玻璃平开门走了进去，踩着散落的包装纸。他穿过一条叮当作响的鼓声，朝南内蒂的阅览室走去。

WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION
我们诚挚地宣布解散

OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS
最受尊敬的都柏林市民

Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.
海因斯也在这里：可能是葬礼的记述。怦。扑通。今天早上已故帕特里克·迪格纳姆先生的遗体。机器。如果他们抓住一个人，就把他粉碎成原子。统治今天的世界。他的机器也正在停工。就像这些，一发不可收拾：发酵。努力工作，撕扯。那只老灰老鼠拼命想钻进去。

HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
一个伟大的日常器官是如何产生的

Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.
布卢姆先生在工头备用的尸体后面停下来，欣赏着一顶光亮的王冠。

Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth. It’s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake’s weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle Toby’s page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin’s queries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I’d like that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World’s biggest balloon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.
奇怪的是他从未见过他真正的国家。爱尔兰我的国家。学院绿色成员。他大力宣扬日常工人的做法。每周销售的是广告和附加功能，而不是官方公报中的陈旧新闻。安妮女王死了。公元1000年权威出版。领地位于廷纳辛奇男爵领地罗森利斯镇。对于所有可能关心的人，根据法规显示从巴利纳出口的骡子和牛仔布数量的返还时间表。自然笔记。卡通。菲尔·布莱克的每周帕特和布尔故事。托比叔叔的小孩子页面。乡巴佬的询问。亲爱的编辑先生，有什么好的治疗胀气的方法吗？我想要那部分。教别人学到很多东西。个人笔记。 M.A.P.主要是所有图片。身材匀称的沐浴者沐浴在金色的绳索上。世界上最大的气球。庆祝姐妹双婚。两位新郎相视而笑。 Cuprani 也是，打印机。比爱尔兰人更像爱尔兰人。

The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the whole thing. Want a cool head.
机器三四次叮当作响。扑通，扑通，扑通。现在，如果他在那里瘫痪了，没有人知道如何阻止他们，他们就会叮当作响，一遍又一遍地打印它。猴子涂鸦整个事情。想要一个冷静的头脑。

—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.
——好吧，把它写进晚报吧，议员，海因斯说。

Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.
很快我们就会称他为市长大人。他们说，长约翰正在支持他。

The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.
工头没有回答​​，只是在纸的一角上潦草地写了一些字，并对着排字机做了个手势。他默默地把床单递到肮脏的玻璃屏风上。

—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.
——右：谢谢，海因斯说走开。

Mr Bloom stood in his way.
布卢姆先生挡住了他的路。

—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.
——如果你想画收银员就去吃午饭了，他用拇指向后指着说道。

—Did you? Hynes asked.
-你是否？海因斯问道。

—Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you’ll catch him.
——嗯，布鲁姆先生说。目光敏锐，你就会抓住他。

—Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I’ll tap him too.
——谢谢，老人，海因斯说。我也来摸摸他

He hurried on eagerly towards the Freeman’s Journal.
他急切地快步走向《自由人杂志》。

Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s. Three weeks. Third hint.
我在米格店里借给他的三个鲍勃。 3周。第三个提示。

WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
我们看到布道者在工作

Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk.
布卢姆先生把他的剪报放在南内蒂先生的桌子上。

—Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?
——对不起，议员，他说。这则广告，你看。凯斯，你还记得吗？

Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.
南内蒂先生考虑了一会儿，然后点了点头。

—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.
——布鲁姆先生说，他希望在七月份完成。

The foreman moved his pencil towards it.
工头把铅笔移向它。

—But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants two keys at the top.
——但是等等，布鲁姆先生说。他想要改变。凯斯，你看。他想要顶部的两把钥匙。

Hell of a racket they make. He doesn’t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves. Maybe he understands what I.
他们制造的噪音真是太吵了。他没有听到。楠楠。钢铁般的神经。也许他明白我的意思。

The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.
工头转过身来耐心地听着，然后抬起手肘，开始慢慢地刮着羊驼毛夹克的腋窝。

—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.
——就这样，布鲁姆先生说，食指交叉在顶部。

Let him take that in first.
让他先接受这个。

Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.
布卢姆先生从他制作的十字架上向侧面看了一眼，看到了工头蜡黄的脸，认为他有一点黄疸，远处是顺从的卷轴，正在喂食巨大的纸网。叮叮当当。叮叮当当。数英里的它展开了。之后会变成什么样呢？哦，把肉包起来，包裹起来：各种用途，一千零一件东西。

Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.
他巧妙地将话语插入叮当声的停顿中，迅速在伤痕累累的木制品上画画。

HOUSE OF KEY(E)S
钥匙屋 (E)S

—Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name. Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.
——就这样，瞧。这里有两把交叉的钥匙。一个圆圈。那么这里的名字。亚历山大·凯斯 (Alexander Keyes)，茶叶、葡萄酒和烈酒商人。很快。

Better not teach him his own business.
最好不要教他自己的事。

—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that’s a good idea?
——议员，你了解你自己，知道他想要什么。然后用铅将顶部围起来：钥匙之家。你看？你认为这是个好主意吗？

The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.
工头把抓挠的手移到了他的下肋骨处，静静地挠了挠。

—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?
——布鲁姆先生说，这个想法就是钥匙之家。你知道，议员，马恩岛议会。暗讽地方自治。你知道，来自马恩岛的游客。吸引眼球，你看。你能做到吗？

I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio. But then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.
我也许可以问他那个“voglio”怎么发音。但如果他不知道的话，只会让他感到尴尬。最好不要。

—We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?
——我们能做到，工头说。你有设计吗？

—I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house there too. I’ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.
——我能拿到，布卢姆先生说。这是在基尔肯尼的一份报纸上发表的。他在那里也有一所房子。我就跑出去问他。好吧，你可以这样做，只是稍微引起注意。你知道平常的事。高级许可场所。朗菲尔想要。很快。

The foreman thought for an instant.
工头想了想。

—We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months’ renewal.
——我们能做到，他说。让他给我们三个月的续约期限。

A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.
排字工给他带来了一张软纸。他开始默默地检查。布卢姆先生站在一旁，听到曲柄发出巨大的震动声，看着沉默的排字工在他们的箱子上工作。

ORTHOGRAPHICAL
正字法

Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn’t it? Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.
想确定他的拼写。证明发烧。马丁·坎宁安今天早上忘记给我们讲他的拼字比赛难题。看到无与伦比的一员让二员感到尴尬是很有趣的，是吗？一个被骚扰的小贩的双重评估，同时用墓地墙下的去皮梨的y来测量对称性。很傻，不是吗？墓地的设立当然是为了对称性。

I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.
当他拍上礼帽时我就应该这么说。谢谢。我应该说一些关于旧帽子之类的事情。不，我可以说。现在看起来就像新的一样。那就看看他的菲兹吧。

Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way. Sllt.
好吧。第一台机器的最下面的甲板上带着第一批折叠好的纸缓慢地向前推进。好吧。几乎是人性化的吸引注意力的方式。尽其所能地说话。那扇门也嘎吱作响，要求关上。一切都以自己的方式说话。好吧。

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
著名的丘奇曼 (Churchman) 是一位临时贡献者

The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
领班突然把纸样交还给他，说道：

—Wait. Where’s the archbishop’s letter? It’s to be repeated in the Telegraph. Where’s what’s his name?
-等待。大主教的信在哪里？ 《电讯报》将重复这一点。他叫什么名字？

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.
他环顾四周那些吵闹、无人应答的机器。

—Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.
——僧侣们，先生？一个声音从铸造箱里问道。

—Ay. Where’s Monks?
——哎呀。僧侣在哪里？

—Monks!
——僧侣们！

Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.
布卢姆先生开始剪纸。是时候出去了。

—Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a good place I know.
——然后我会得到设计，南内蒂先生，他说，你会给它一个我知道的好地方。

—Monks!
——僧侣们！

—Yes, sir.
-是的先生。

Three months’ renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists over for the show.
三个月续签。我想先散散心。无论如何尝试一下。八月摩擦：好主意：马展月。鲍尔斯布里奇。游客前来观看表演。

A DAYFATHER
日父

He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.
他继续穿过案件室，经过一位老人，他弯着腰，戴着眼镜，系着围裙。老和尚，日父。他一生中一定经历过很多奇怪的东西：讣告、酒吧广告、演讲、离婚诉讼、被发现溺水身亡。现在他的绳索已经接近极限了。我想说的是，他是一个严肃认真的人，在储蓄银行里有一点存款。妻子是个好厨师和洗衣工。女儿在客厅里操作机器。简简单单，没有废话。

AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
那是逾越节的盛宴

He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage Alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu. No, that’s the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob’s sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else. That’s what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.
他继续走着，看着排字工整齐地排版。先倒着读。他很快就做到了。必须需要一些练习。曼吉德·克西尔塔P。可怜的爸爸拿着他的哈加达书，用手指倒着读给我听。逾越节。明年在耶路撒冷。亲爱的，亲爱的！所有这些漫长的事情把我们从埃及地带进了奴役之家阿肋路亚。谢玛·以色列·阿多奈·埃洛赫努。不，那是另一个。然后是雅各的儿子十二兄弟。然后是羔羊、猫、狗、棍子、水和屠夫。然后死亡天使杀死了屠夫，屠夫杀死了牛，狗杀死了猫。听起来有点傻，直到你仔细研究一下。它意味着正义，但每个人都吃掉其他人。毕竟，这就是生活。他做这项工作的速度有多快。熟能生巧。似乎用手指就能看到。

Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron’s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.
布卢姆先生从叮当作响的噪音中穿过走廊，来到了楼梯平台。现在我要把它一路拉出来，然后也许能把他抓出来。最好先给他打电话。数字？是的。和Citron家一样。二十八。二十八双四。

ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
肥皂再一次

He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door when I was there.
他走下房子的楼梯。是谁用火柴在墙上乱涂乱画？看来他们是为了打赌才这么做的。那些作品里总有一股浓重的油腻味。当我在那里的时候，隔壁汤姆家的胶水是温热的。

He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.
他拿出手帕擦鼻子。香茅柠檬？啊，我放在那里的肥皂。从那个口袋里把它丢掉。他把手帕放回去，拿出肥皂，把它扣好，塞进裤子后袋里。

What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.
你妻子用什么香水？我仍然可以回家：电车：我忘记了。只是为了看看：之前：穿衣。不，这里。不。

A sudden screech of laughter came from the Evening Telegraph office. Know who that is. What’s up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it is.
电讯晚报办公室突然传来一阵刺耳的笑声。知道那是谁。这是怎么回事？一分钟后就打电话。内德·兰伯特 是的。

He entered softly.
他轻声走进去。

ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
艾琳，银海的绿色宝石

—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.
——幽灵行走，麦克休教授对着布满灰尘的窗玻璃轻轻地、饼干般地低声说道。

Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing face, asked of it sourly:
迪达勒斯先生在空荡荡的壁炉里盯着奈德·兰伯特那张疑惑的脸，酸溜溜地问道：

—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?
——痛苦的基督，这不会让你感到胃灼热吗？

Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
内德·兰伯特坐在桌子上，继续读道：

—Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ‘mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ‘neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. How’s that for high?
——或者再一次，注意一些蜿蜒的小溪，它在路上潺潺流淌，虽然与石质障碍争吵，但到了海王星蓝色领域翻滚的水域，“在长满青苔的河岸中间，被最温和的和风扇动，被光荣的风吹拂着”阳光下或森林巨人的枝叶投射在它沉思的胸前的阴影下。那怎么样，西蒙？他隔着报纸的边缘问道。怎么样才算是高呢？

—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.
——换饮料，迪达勒斯先生说。

Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
内德·兰伯特笑着拍打膝盖上的报纸，重复道：

—The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. O boys! O boys!
——沉思的胸怀和傲慢的叶子。孩子们啊！孩子们啊！

—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.
——色诺芬看着马拉松，迪达勒斯先生说，又看了看壁炉和窗户，马拉松看着大海。

—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don’t want to hear any more of the stuff.
——那就行了，麦克休教授在窗外喊道。我不想再听到这些东西了。

He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
他吃掉了刚刚啃过的新月形水饼干，肚子饿了，准备啃另一只手上的饼干。

High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does. He has influence they say. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.
高调的东西。膀胱袋。我知道内德·兰伯特要休息一天了。葬礼确实会让一个人的一天变得不安。他们说他有影响力。副校长老查特顿是他的叔祖父或曾祖父。他们说快九十了。副队长为他的死写了这么久也许。活着就是为了激怒他们。可能他自己先走。约翰尼，给你叔叔腾地方。赫奇斯·艾尔·查特顿阁下。敢说他会在大风天给他写一两张奇怪的摇摇晃晃的支票。当他踢出去时，会有意外收获。哈利路亚。

—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.
——又是一次痉挛，内德·兰伯特说。

—What is it? Mr Bloom asked.
-它是什么？布鲁姆先生问道。

—A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone. Our lovely land.
——根据最近发现的西塞罗的片段，麦克休教授用隆重的语气回答道。我们可爱的土地。

SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
简短但切中要点

—Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.
——谁的土地？布鲁姆先生简单地说。

—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an accent on the whose.
——最相关的问题，教授在咀嚼之间说道。重音是“谁”。

—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.
——丹·道森的土地，迪达勒斯先生说。

—Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.
——这是他昨晚的演讲吗？布鲁姆先生问道。

Ned Lambert nodded.
内德·兰伯特点点头。

—But listen to this, he said.
——但是听听这个，他说。

The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.
当门被推进去时，门把手击中了布鲁姆先生的后腰。

—Excuse me, J. J. O’Molloy said, entering.
——对不起，J·J·奥莫洛伊进来时说道。

Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.
布卢姆先生敏捷地挪到一边。

—I beg yours, he said.
——我求你了，他说。

—Good day, Jack.
——美好的一天，杰克。

—Come in. Come in.
——进来吧。进来吧。

—Good day.
-再会。

—How are you, Dedalus?
——你好吗，迪达勒斯？

—Well. And yourself?
-出色地。和你自己？

J. J. O’Molloy shook his head.
J.J.奥莫洛伊摇摇头。

SAD
伤心

Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap. That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What’s in the wind, I wonder. Money worry.
他曾经是初级酒吧里最聪明的家伙。拒绝吧，可怜的家伙。对于一个男人来说，那种忙碌的红晕意味着结束。触摸并与他同行。我想知道风里有什么。钱愁。

—Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks.
——或者，如果我们只是爬上连绵的山峰的话。

—You’re looking extra.
——你看起来额外了。

—Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O’Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.
——编辑要见吗？ J·J·奥莫洛伊看向内门问道。

—Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He’s in his sanctum with Lenehan.
——确实如此，麦克休教授说。被看到和听到。他和莱内汉在他的密室里。

J. J. O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.
J·J·奥莫洛伊漫步到倾斜的办公桌前，开始翻开粉红色的文件页。

Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the Express with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began on the Independent. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same breath. Wouldn’t know which to believe. One story good till you hear the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.
练习逐渐减少。可能是。失去了心。赌博。荣誉债。收割旋风。曾获得 D. 和 T. 菲茨杰拉德的良好聘用。他们的假发展示了灰质。他们袖子上的大脑就像格拉斯内文的雕像一样。相信他和加布里埃尔·康罗伊一起为《快报》做了一些文学作品。博学的家伙。迈尔斯·克劳福德开始在《独立报》上发表文章。有趣的是，那些新闻记者听到新开张的风声时就转向了。风标。冷热同呼吸。不知道该相信哪个。一个故事很好，直到你听到下一个。光着头在报纸上互相攻击，然后一切就都烟消云散了。冰雹家伙下一刻见面了。

—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks …
——啊，看在上帝的份上，听听这个吧，内德·兰伯特恳求道。或者，如果我们爬上连绵的山峰……

—Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated windbag!
——夸夸其谈！教授暴躁地插话道。足够的充气风袋了！

—Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were …
——山峰，奈德·兰伯特继续说道，高耸入云，可以说是在沐浴我们的灵魂……

—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he taking anything for it?
——给他的嘴唇洗澡，迪达勒斯先生说。可称颂且永恒的神！是的？他有为此付出什么吗？

—As ‘twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight …
——事实上，在爱尔兰的无与伦比的全景中，尽管它们在其他备受赞誉的优质地区拥有广受好评的原型，但由于非常美丽，灌木丛和起伏的平原和甘美的春绿色牧场，沉浸在我们超凡的半透明光芒中，这是无与伦比的。温和神秘的爱尔兰黄昏……

HIS NATIVE DORIC
他的家乡多立克

—The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.
——月球，麦克休教授说。他忘记了哈姆雷特。

—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence …
——那覆盖着远方和广阔的远景，等待着月亮的光球闪耀出她的银色光芒……

—O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions! That’ll do, Ned. Life is too short.
——噢！迪达勒斯先生哭了，发出绝望的呻吟。妈的还有洋葱！就这样，内德。人生如此短暂。

He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.
他摘下丝质帽子，不耐烦地吹掉浓密的小胡子，用手指梳理着头发。

Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face.
内德·兰伯特把报纸扔到一边，高兴地咯咯笑起来。过了一会儿，麦克休教授那张没刮胡子、戴着黑眼镜的脸上突然爆发出一声沙哑的笑声。

—Doughy Daw! he cried.
——多吉道！他哭了。

WHAT WETHERUP SAID
韦瑟鲁普说了什么

All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he? Why they call him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely. Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get a grip of them by the stomach.
现在嘲笑它是很好的冷刊，但它就像热蛋糕那样的东西。他也在面包店排队，不是吗？为什么他们叫他 Doughy Daw。无论如何，他的巢都装饰得很好。女儿和税务局那个拿着汽车的小伙子订婚了。钩得很好。娱乐活动。打开房门。大井喷。韦瑟鲁普总是这么说。抓住他们的胃。

The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:
内门被猛烈地打开，一张猩红色的喙脸，顶着一顶羽毛状的头发，探了进来。大胆的蓝眼睛环视着他们，严厉的声音问道：

—What is it?
-它是什么？

—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.
——假乡绅亲自来了！麦克休教授堂堂正正地说。

—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.
——Getonouthat，你这个该死的老教师！编辑表示认可。

—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink after that.
——来吧，奈德，迪达勒斯先生一边说，一边戴上帽子。在那之后我必须喝一杯。

—Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
-喝！编辑哭了。弥撒前不提供饮料。

—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
——也很对，迪达勒斯先生一边说，一边出去。来吧，内德。

Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor’s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.
内德·兰伯特从桌子旁侧身下来。编辑的蓝眼睛扫向布鲁姆先生的脸上，脸上带着微笑。

—Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.
——迈尔斯，你愿意加入我们吗？内德·兰伯特问道。

MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
回忆难忘的战斗

—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
——北科克民兵！编辑喊道，大步走向壁炉架。我们每次都赢了！北科克和西班牙军官！

—Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.
——那是哪里，迈尔斯？内德·兰伯特若有所思地看了一眼自己的脚趾问道。

—In Ohio! the editor shouted.
——在俄亥俄州！编辑喊道。

—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
——事实确实如此，奈德·兰伯特同意了。

Passing out he whispered to J. J. O’Molloy:
昏倒后，他低声对 J·J·奥莫洛伊说道：

—Incipient jigs. Sad case.
——早期的夹具。悲伤的案例。

—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. My Ohio!
——俄亥俄！编辑抬起他猩红的脸，高声喊道。我的俄亥俄州！

—A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.
——一个完美的批评家！教授说。长、短、长。

O, HARP EOLIAN!
啊，竖琴风神！

He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.
他从背心口袋里拿出一卷牙线，折下一块，在他两两颗未洗过的、会发出响声的牙齿之间灵活地拨动。

—Bingbang, bangbang.
——棒棒，棒棒。

Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
布卢姆先生看到海岸已畅通无阻，便向内门走去。

—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.
——请稍等，克劳福德先生，他说。我只是想打电话询问广告事宜。

He went in.
他进去了。

—What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
——今晚那个领导怎么样？麦克休教授走到编辑身边，用力握住他的肩膀，问道。

—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret. Hello, Jack. That’s all right.
——没关系，迈尔斯·克劳福德更加平静地说。永远不要担心。你好，杰克。没关系。

—Good day, Myles, J. J. O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?
——美好的一天，迈尔斯，J·J·奥莫洛伊说，让他手中的纸页无力地滑回文件上。今天加拿大诈骗案发生了吗？

The telephone whirred inside.
电话在里面嗡嗡作响。

—Twentyeight … No, twenty … Double four … Yes.
——二十八……不，二十……双四……是的。

SPOT THE WINNER
发现获胜者

Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT’S tissues.
莱内汉拿着 SPORT 的纸巾从内部办公室出来。

—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O. Madden up.
——谁想要金杯赛的死证明？他问。权杖与 O. Madden 一起。

He tossed the tissues on to the table.
他把纸巾扔到桌子上。

Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.
大厅里光着脚的报童的尖叫声冲过来，门被猛地打开了。

—Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
——嘘，莱内汉说。我听到脚步声。

Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.
麦克休教授大步穿过房间，抓住了那个畏缩的顽童的衣领，其他人则跑出大厅，跑下台阶。纸巾在气流中沙沙作响，在空中轻轻地漂浮着蓝色的潦草的文字，最后落到了桌子下面。

—It wasn’t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
——不是我，先生。是那个大个子推了我，先生。

—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There’s a hurricane blowing.
——把他扔出去，关上门，编辑说。有飓风吹过。

Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.
莱内汉开始用爪子把地板上的纸巾捡起来，弯下腰，咕哝了两声。

—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.
——等待赛车特别节目，先生，报童说。是帕特·法雷尔推了我，先生。

He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
他指着门框周围凝视着的两张脸。

—Him, sir.
——他，先生。

—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
——麦克休教授粗声粗气地说。

He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
他把男孩推出去，然后砰地关上了门。

J. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
J·J·奥莫洛伊把文件翻了个底朝天，低声问道：

—Continued on page six, column four.
——续第六页第四栏。

—Yes, Evening Telegraph here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Is the boss …? Yes, Telegraph … To where? Aha! Which auction rooms ? … Aha! I see … Right. I’ll catch him.
——是的，《电讯晚报》，布卢姆先生从内部办公室打来电话。老板是……吗？是的，电报……到哪里？啊哈！哪个拍卖场？ ……啊哈！我明白了……对。我会抓住他的。

A COLLISION ENSUES
发生碰撞

The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
当他挂断电话时，门铃又响了。他很快就进来了，撞到了正在挣扎着拿第二张纸巾的莱内汉。

—Pardon, monsieur, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.
——请原谅，先生，莱内汉说，抓住了他一会儿，做了个鬼脸。

—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I’m in a hurry.
——我的错，布卢姆先生一边说，一边受着他的紧握。你受伤了吗？我很急。

—Knee, Lenehan said.
——膝盖，莱内汉说。

He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
他做了个滑稽的表情，揉着膝盖哀嚎道：

—The accumulation of the anno Domini.
——纪元的积累。

—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
——抱歉，布鲁姆先生说。

He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:
他走到门口，半开着门，停了下来。 J·J·奥莫洛伊把厚重的书页拍翻了。蹲在门口台阶上的报童在空荡荡的走廊里回响着两个尖锐的声音，就像口风琴一样：

—We are the boys of Wexford
——我们是韦克斯福德的男孩

Who fought with heart and hand.
谁用心​​和手战斗。

EXIT BLOOM
退出布卢姆

—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes’s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s.
——我正跑到学士街去，布鲁姆先生说，关于凯斯的这则广告。想把它修好。他们告诉我他就在狄龙那里。

He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
他犹豫不决地看着他们的脸。靠在壁炉架上，用手撑着头的编辑，突然大大地伸出了一只手臂。

—Begone! he said. The world is before you.
——走吧！他说。世界就在你面前。

—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
——很快就回来了，布卢姆先生一边说着，一边急匆匆地走了出去。

J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.
J·J·奥莫洛伊从莱内汉手中接过纸巾，仔细阅读，轻轻地将它们吹开，没有发表任何评论。

—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.
——他会收到那个广告的，教授说，透过交叉百叶窗上的黑框眼镜凝视着。看看他身后的那些年轻流氓。

—Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.
-展示。在哪里？莱纳汉哭着跑到窗前。

A STREET CORTEGE
街头队列

Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.
两人都在百叶窗外微笑着，看着布卢姆先生身后的一队蹦蹦跳跳的报童，最后一只白色的风筝在微风中蜿蜒曲折，是一只嘲弄的风筝，一条白色蝴蝶结的尾巴。

—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you’ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.
——看看他身后那些年轻的水鸟，他的声音和哭泣，莱内汉说，你会踢的。哦，我的肋骨真可笑！脱掉他的扁平斯帕格和散步。小九。偷云雀。

He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.
他开始以滑稽的方式在地板上跳玛祖卡舞，双脚滑过壁炉，走向 J·J·奥莫洛伊 (J. J. O’Molloy)，后者将纸巾放在他接球的手中。

—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two gone?
-那是什么？迈尔斯·克劳福德吃了一惊说道。另外两个去哪儿了？

—Who? the professor said, turning. They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
-WHO？教授转身说道。他们去椭圆形体育场喝一杯。帕迪·胡珀和杰克·霍尔也在场。昨晚过来的。

—Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where’s my hat?
——那就来吧，迈尔斯·克劳福德说。我的帽子在哪里？

He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
他摇摇晃晃地走进后面的办公室，打开夹克的通风口，后口袋里的钥匙叮当作响。当他锁上办公桌抽屉时，它们在空气中和木头上叮当作响。

—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
——他状态很好，麦克休教授低声说道。

—Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most matches?
——似乎是这样，J·J·奥莫洛伊一边低声沉思着，一边拿出烟盒说道，但事实并非总是如此。谁的比赛最多？

THE CALUMET OF PEACE
和平的卡鲁梅特

He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J. O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
他向教授递了一支烟，自己也抽了一根。莱内汉立即为他们划了根火柴，依次为他们点燃了香烟。 J.J.奥莫洛伊再次打开他的案子并提供了它。

—Thanky vous, Lenehan said, helping himself.
——谢谢你，莱内汉边说边帮自己。

The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
编辑从内室出来，头上歪着一顶草帽。他严厉地指着麦克休教授，用歌声朗诵道：

—‘Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
——“是地位和名誉诱惑了你，

‘Twas empire charmed thy heart.
‘是帝国迷住了你的心。

The professor grinned, locking his long lips.
教授咧嘴一笑，紧闭着长嘴唇。

—Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
——呃？你他妈的老罗马帝国？迈尔斯·克劳福德说道。

He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:
他从打开的烟盒里拿出一根香烟。莱内汉迅速优雅地为他点灯，说道：

—Silence for my brandnew riddle!
——为我的全新谜语保持沉默！

—Imperium romanum, J. J. O’Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.
——罗马帝国，J·J·奥莫洛伊温和地说。听起来比英国或布里克斯顿高贵。这个词不知何故让人想起火中的脂肪。

Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
迈尔斯·克劳福德朝天花板猛烈地吹了第一口烟。

—That’s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire. We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.
——就是这样，他说。我们就是胖子。你我都是火中的脂肪。我们没有机会在地狱里滚雪球。

THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
罗马的辉煌

—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.
——等一下，麦克休教授说，同时举起了两只安静的爪子。我们不能被言语、言语的声音所迷惑。我们想到的罗马是帝国主​​义的、专横的、命令式的。

He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
他从磨损的、污迹斑斑的衬衫袖口中伸出了演讲的手臂，停了下来：

—What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: It is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah. The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset.
——他们的文明是什么？巨大，我承认：但是卑鄙。阴沟：下水道。旷野里和山顶上的犹太人说：来到这里很合适。让我们为耶和华筑一座坛。罗马人就像追随他脚步的英国人一样，把他踏足的每一个新海岸（他从未踏足过我们的海岸）都带来了他对泄殖腔的痴迷。他环顾四周，穿着长袍，说道：很高兴来到这里。让我们建造一个抽水马桶。

—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the running stream.
——他们确实这么做了，莱内汉说。正如我们在《吉尼斯世界纪录》第一章中读到的那样，我们的远古祖先偏爱奔流的溪流。

—They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. But we have also Roman law.
——他们是大自然的绅士，J·J·奥莫洛伊低声说道。但我们也有罗马法。

—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
——麦克休教授回应道，本丢彼拉多是它的先知。

—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O’Molloy asked. It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly …
——你知道关于首席帕勒斯男爵的故事吗？ J.J.奥莫洛伊问道。那是在皇家大学的晚宴上。一切都进展顺利……

—First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
——首先是我的谜语，莱内汉说。你准备好了吗？

Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.
奥马登·伯克先生从走廊走进来，身材高大，身穿厚重的多尼戈尔花呢灰色衣服。史蒂芬·迪达勒斯（Stephen Dedalus）在他身后，进入时没有遮盖。

—Entrez, mes enfants! Lenehan cried.
——Entrez，我的孩子们！莱纳汉哭了。

—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.
——我护送一名恳求者，奥马登·伯克先生悠扬地说。经验带领的青年拜访恶名。

—How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your governor is just gone.
-你好吗？编辑伸出一只手说道。进来吧，你们的州长刚刚走了。

? ? ?
？ ？ ？

Lenehan said to all:
莱内汉对大家说：

—Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.
-安静！什么歌剧像铁路线？反思、沉思、深思熟虑、答复。

Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.
斯蒂芬递出打印好的纸张，指着标题和签名。

—Who? the editor asked.
-WHO？编辑问道。

Bit torn off.
有点撕下来了

—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.
——加勒特·迪西先生，斯蒂芬说。

—That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?
——那旧东西已经破烂不堪了，编辑说。是谁撕的？他是不是被低估了？

On swift sail flaming
乘着急速的风帆，燃烧着

From storm and south
来自风暴和南方

He comes, pale vampire,
他来了，苍白的吸血鬼，

Mouth to my mouth.
嘴对着我的嘴。

—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned …?
——美好的一天，史蒂芬，教授说，从他们的肩膀上看过去。脚和嘴？你变身了吗……？

Bullockbefriending bard.
布洛克与吟游诗人交朋友。

SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
Shindy 在知名餐厅

—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to …
——美好的一天，先生，斯蒂芬红着脸回答道。这封信不是我的。加勒特·迪西先生让我……

—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s face in the Star and Garter. Oho!
——噢，我认识他，迈尔斯·克劳福德说，我也认识他的妻子。上帝创造的最血腥的老鞑靼人。天哪，她得了口蹄疫，而且没有错！那天晚上，她把汤泼到星嘉德餐厅服务员的脸上。噢！

A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.
一个女人把罪恶带入了世界。对于墨涅拉俄斯的离家出走的妻子海伦来说，希腊人十年了。奥罗克，布雷夫尼王子。

—Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
——他是鳏夫吗？史蒂芬问。

—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript. Emperor’s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna. Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes, every time. Don’t you forget that!
——嗯，草的，迈尔斯·克劳福德说，他的眼睛扫过打字稿。皇帝的马匹。哈布斯堡。一名爱尔兰人在维也纳城墙上救了他的命。你别忘了！马克西米利安·卡尔·奥唐纳 (Maximilian Karl O’Donnell)，爱尔兰冯·蒂康奈尔伯爵。现在派他的继承人让国王成为奥地利陆军元帅。总有一天那里会遇到麻烦。大雁。哦，是的，每次。你别忘了这一点！

—The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O’Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.
——问题在于他是否忘记了，J·J·奥莫洛伊一边转动马蹄形镇纸，一边轻声说道。拯救王子是一项感恩的工作。

Professor MacHugh turned on him.
麦克休教授转向了他。

—And if not? he said.
-如果不？他说。

—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one day …
——我来告诉你是怎么回事，迈尔斯·克劳福德开始说道。有一天，一位匈牙利人……

LOST CAUSES
失去的原因

NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
提到的贵族侯爵

—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money. Material domination. Dominus! Lord! Where is the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!
——我们总是忠于失败的事业，教授说。对我们来说，成功就是智力和想象力的死亡。我们从来不忠于成功者。我们为他们服务。我教的是明目张胆的拉丁语。我说的是一个种族的语言，他们的心态是至高无上的：时间就是金钱。物质统治。主宰！主！灵性在哪里？上帝？索尔兹伯里勋爵？西部俱乐部的沙发。但是希腊人！

KYRIE ELEISON!
凯里·艾莱森！

A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.
一抹微笑照亮了他的黑眼圈，拉长了他的长唇。

—The Greek! he said again. Kyrios! Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not. Kyrie! The radiance of the intellect. I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. Kyrie eleison! The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an imperium, that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.
——希腊人！他又说道。基里奥斯！发光字！闪米特人和撒克逊人不知道元音。凯里！智慧的光芒。我应该自称希腊语，心灵的语言。凯里·艾利森！壁橱匠和泄殖腔匠永远不会成为我们精神的主人。我们是在特拉法加沉没的欧洲天主教骑士精神的臣民，也是在埃戈斯波塔米与雅典舰队一起沉没的精神帝国（而不是帝国）的臣民。是的是的。他们沉沦了。皮洛士受到神谕的误导，最后一次尝试挽回希腊的命运。忠于失败的事业。

He strode away from them towards the window.
他大步离开他们，朝窗户走去。

—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.
——他们前去战斗，奥马登伯克先生灰白地说，但他们总是倒下。

—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matinée. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
-号泣！莱纳汉哭得有点响。由于在日场后半段收到了一块砖头。可怜的，可怜的，可怜的皮洛士！

He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:
然后他在斯蒂芬耳边低声说道：

LENEHAN’S LIMERICK
莱尼汉的利默里克

There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh
有一位笨重的专家麦克休

Who wears goggles of ebony hue.

In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.
马里根说，为了悼念萨卢斯特。谁的母亲惨死了。

Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.
迈尔斯·克劳福德把床单塞进侧袋。

—That’ll be all right, he said. I’ll read the rest after. That’ll be all right.
——没关系，他说。我会在之后阅读其余部分。这样就可以了。

Lenehan extended his hands in protest.
莱内汉伸出双手表示抗议。

—But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?
——但是我的谜语！他说。什么歌剧像铁路？

—Opera? Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.
-歌剧？奥马登·伯克先生的狮身人面像再次出现了问题。

Lenehan announced gladly:
莱内汉高兴地宣布：

—The Rose of Castile. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!
——卡斯蒂利亚的玫瑰。看到喘息声了吗？铸钢排。哎呀！

He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O’Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.
他轻轻地戳了戳奥马登·伯克先生的脾脏。奥马登·伯克先生优雅地靠在伞上，假装喘着粗气。

—Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.
-帮助！他叹了口气。我感到一种强烈的弱点。

Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.
莱内汉踮起脚尖，用沙沙作响的纸巾迅速扇着脸。

The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.
教授拿着文件回来，用手扫过斯蒂芬和奥马登·伯克先生松散的领带。

—Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.
——巴黎，过去和现在，他说。你们看起来像公社成员。

—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O’Molloy said in quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.
——就像那些炸毁巴士底狱的家伙一样，J·J·奥莫洛伊轻声嘲讽地说。或者是你射杀了你们之间的芬兰中尉？你看起来好像你已经完成了这件事。博布里科夫将军。

OMNIUM GATHERUM
OMNIUM 聚集

—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.
——我们只是在考虑这个问题，斯蒂芬说。

—All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics …
——所有的才华，迈尔斯·克劳福德说。法律、经典……

—The turf, Lenehan put in.
——草皮，莱内汉铺上去的。

—Literature, the press.
——文学、新闻界。

—If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.
——如果布鲁姆在这里的话，教授说。广告的温柔艺术。

—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin’s prime favourite.
——还有布卢姆女士，奥马登·伯克先生补充道。声音缪斯。都柏林的最爱。

Lenehan gave a loud cough.
莱内汉大声咳嗽了一声。

—Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park. The gate was open.
——咳咳！他非常轻声地说。噢，呼吸新鲜空气！我在公园里感冒了。门是开着的。

YOU CAN DO IT
你能行的

!

The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.
编辑紧张地将手放在斯蒂芬的肩膀上。

—I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. In the lexicon of youth …
——我想让你为我写点东西，他说。里面有东西咬了一口。你能行的。我从你的脸上看到了这一点。在年轻人的词典里……

See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.
从你的脸上看到它。看在你的眼里。懒惰无事的小阴谋家。

—Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.
——手足口病！编辑轻蔑地谩骂地哭了。伟大的民族主义会议在博里斯因奥索里举行。全是球！欺负大众！给他们一些咬过的东西。把我们都放进去，该死的灵魂。圣父、圣子、圣灵和杰克斯·麦卡锡。

—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
——我们都可以提供精神食粮，奥马登·伯克先生说。

Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.
斯蒂芬抬起眼睛，看到那双大胆的、漠不关心的目光。

—He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O’Molloy said.
——他想要你加入记者团，J·J·奥莫洛伊说。

THE GREAT GALLAHER
伟大的加拉赫

—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis. Wait a minute. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made his mark? I’ll tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. I’ll show you.
——你能做到的，迈尔斯·克劳福德重复道，握紧了手强调。等一下。正如伊格纳修斯·加拉赫（Ignatius Gallaher）在克拉伦斯号（Clarence）的沙夫劳恩（shaughraun）上打台球时常说的那样，我们将使欧洲陷入瘫痪。加拉赫，那是你的新闻记者。那是一支笔。你知道他是如何出名的吗？我会告诉你。这是有史以来最聪明的新闻报道。那是八十岁，五月六日，无敌时代，凤凰公园发生谋杀案，我想是在你出生之前。我会给你看。

He pushed past them to the files.
他推开他们，走向文件。

—Look at here, he said turning. The New York World cabled for a special. Remember that time?
——看这里，他转身说道。纽约世界报特别报道。还记得那次吗？

Professor MacHugh nodded.
麦克休教授点点头。

—New York World, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and the rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?
——《纽约世界》，编辑兴奋地推开草帽说道。事情发生的地方。蒂姆·凯利，我是说卡瓦纳。乔·布雷迪和其他人。剥山羊皮开汽车的地方。整个路线，看到了吗？

—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me. You know Holohan?
——剥山羊皮，奥马登伯克先生说。菲茨哈里斯。他们说，他在巴特桥那里有马车夫的住所。霍洛汉告诉我的。你认识霍洛汉吗？

—Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.
—跳起来并携带一个，是吗？迈尔斯·克劳福德说道。

—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation. A night watchman.
——可怜的古姆利也在那里，他告诉我，为公司做护石。一名守夜人。

Stephen turned in surprise.
史蒂芬惊讶地转过身来。

—Gumley? he said. You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is it?
——古姆利？他说。你不这么说吗？我父亲的一个朋友，是吗？

—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind the stones, see they don’t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius Gallaher do? I’ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have you Weekly Freeman of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?
——别管古姆利了，迈尔斯·克劳福德愤怒地喊道。让古姆利照看石头，确保它们不会逃跑。看看这里。伊格内修斯·加拉赫做了什么？我会告诉你。天才的灵感。立即有线。你有 3 月 17 日的《自由人周刊》吗？正确的。你明白了吗？

He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.
他把文件翻到背面，把手指放在一个点上。

—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say. Have you got that? Right.
——以第四页为例，布兰森咖啡的广告。你明白了吗？正确的。

The telephone whirred.
电话呼呼地响了。

A DISTANT VOICE
遥远的声音

—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.
——我会回答的，教授边说边走了。

—B is parkgate. Good.
—B 是公园门。好的。

His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.
他的手指跳跃着，一点一点地敲击着，颤抖着。

—T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon gate.
——T是总督府。 C是凶杀案发生的地方。 K是Knockmaroon门。

The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles. An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.
他脖子上松软的肉像公鸡的肉垂一样颤抖着。一根浆糊糊糊的丁丁伸出来，他以一个粗鲁的姿势把它塞回背心里。

—Hello? Evening Telegraph here … Hello? … Who’s there? … Yes … Yes … Yes.
-你好？电讯晚报在这里……喂？ … 谁在那儿？ … 对对对。

—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P. Got that? X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.
—F 到 P 是剥皮山羊为不在场证明而开车的路线：Inchicore、Roundtown、Windy Arbour、Palmerston Park、Ranelagh。 F.A.B.P.了解？ X 是位于上利森街的戴维酒馆。

The professor came to the inner door.
教授来到内门。

—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.
——布鲁姆正在打电话，他说。

—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy’s publichouse, see?
——让他见鬼去吧，编辑立即说道。 X是戴维的酒馆，明白吗？

CLEVER, VERY
聪明，非常

—Clever, Lenehan said. Very.
——聪明，莱内汉说。非常。

—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.
——迈尔斯·克劳福德说，把整个血腥的历史放在热板上给他们。

Nightmare from which you will never awake.
一场你永远无法醒来的噩梦。

—I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.
——我看到了，编辑自豪地说。我在场。迪克·亚当斯，上帝赋予生命气息的最善良的血腥科克曼人，还有我自己。

Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
莱内汉向一道空气鞠了一躬，宣布：

—Madam, I’m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.
——女士，我是亚当。在我看到厄尔巴岛之前，艾伯就是我。

—History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince’s street was there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star. Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld. That’s press. That’s talent. Pyatt! He was all their daddies!
-历史！迈尔斯·克劳福德哭了。王子街的老太婆先到了。人们为此哭泣、切齿。出于广告。格雷戈尔·格雷（Gregor Gray）为其设计了设计。这让他站稳了脚跟。后来帕迪·胡珀 (Paddy Hooper) 与泰·佩 (Tay Pay) 合作，泰·佩 (Tay Pay) 将他带到了《星报》(Star)。现在他和布鲁门菲尔德在一起了。那是新闻。这就是天赋。皮亚特！他是他们所有人的爸爸！

—The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.
——莱尼汉证实，他是恐怖新闻之父，也是克里斯·卡利南的妹夫。

—Hello? … Are you there? … Yes, he’s here still. Come across yourself.
-你好？ … 你在吗？ ……是的，他还在这里。遇见你自己。

—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried. He flung the pages down.
——现在哪里能找到这样的新闻记者，嗯？编辑哭了。他把书页扔了下来。

—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.
——闭嘴，莱内汉对奥马登·伯克先生说。

—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
——非常聪明，奥马登伯克先生说。

Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.
麦克休教授来自内部办公室。

—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder
——说到无敌，他说，你有没有看到录音机前有一些小贩

—O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
——哦，是的，J·J·奥莫洛伊热切地说。达德利夫人穿过公园步行回家，看到去年被飓风吹倒的所有树木，她想买下都柏林的景色。原来这是一张纪念乔·布雷迪、《一号》或《剥山羊皮》的明信片。想象一下，就在总督府外面！

—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said. Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan. Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.
——迈尔斯·克劳福德说，他们只属于钩眼部门。呸！按吧！现在酒吧里哪里有像那些家伙一样的人，比如怀特塞德，比如艾萨克·巴特，比如能说会道的奥哈根。呃？啊，该死的废话。呸！只在半便士的地方。

His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.
他的嘴角继续抽搐着，露出神经质的轻蔑之色，无言以对。

Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you write it then?
有人希望她亲吻那张嘴吗？你怎么知道？那你为什么写它呢？

RHYMES AND REASONS
韵律和理由

Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.
口，南边。嘴在南边吗？还是南边一张嘴？一定有一些。南方，噘嘴，出去，喊叫，干旱。押韵：两个男人穿着一样，看起来一样，两个两个。

… … … … … … … … la tua pace
……………………拉图阿步伐

… … … … … … che parlar ti piace
… … … … … che parlar ti piace

…. mentreché il vento, come fa, si tace.
…… mentreché il vento，来吧，si tace。

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, per l’aer perso, in mauve, in purple, quella pacifica oriafiamma, gold of oriflamme, di rimirar fe piu ardenti. But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.
他看见她们三个三个地走近女孩，穿着绿色的、玫瑰色的、赤褐色的，纠缠在一起，个人的、紫红色的、紫色的、紫红色的、金黄色的、di rimirar fe piu ardenti。但我这些老人，悔罪不已，步履沉重，在黑夜之下：南方的嘴：坟墓的子宫。

—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
——为自己说话，奥马登·伯克先生说。

SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY
足够一天使用

…

J. J. O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.
J·J·奥莫洛伊苍白地微笑着，拿起量具。

—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention Paddy Kelly’s Budget, Pue’s Occurrences and our watchful friend The Skibbereen Eagle. Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.
——我亲爱的迈尔斯，他把香烟扔到一边说道，你对我的话做出了错误的解释。正如目前所建议的那样，我对作为职业的第三种职业没有任何要求，但你的软木腿正在和你一起逃跑。为什么不引进亨利·格拉坦、弗拉德、德摩斯梯尼和埃德蒙·伯克呢？我们都认识伊格内修斯·加拉赫（Ignatius Gallaher）和他的 Chapelizod 老板、法新出版社的哈姆斯沃斯（Harmsworth），以及他在包厘街（Bowery guttersheet）的美国表弟，更不用说帕迪·凯利（Paddy Kelly）的《预算》（Budget）、普伊（Pue）的《事件》（Pue's Occurrences）和我们警惕的朋友《斯基伯林鹰》（The Skibbereen Eagle）。为什么要请怀特塞德这样的法庭口才大师呢？一天的报纸就足够了。

LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
与昔日的联系

—Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas. Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!
——格拉坦和弗拉德就为这篇论文撰稿，编辑当着他的面哭了。爱尔兰志愿者。你现在在哪里？成立于 1763 年。卢卡斯博士。你现在有谁像约翰·菲尔波特·柯兰一样？呸！

—Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.
——嗯，J. J. O’Molloy 说，例如 Bushe K.C.。

—Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.
——布什？编辑说。嗯，是的：布什，是的。他的血液里就有这种基因。肯德尔·布什，或者我的意思是西摩·布什。

—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for … But no matter.
——教授说，他很久以前就会坐在替补席上，只是为了……但没关系。

J. J. O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
J·J·奥莫洛伊转向斯蒂芬，轻声缓慢地说：

—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.
——我认为我一生中听过的最优美的时期之一出自西摩·布什之口。就是那起兄弟相残案，即查尔兹谋杀案。布什为他辩护。

And in the porches of mine ear did pour.
倒在我耳边的门廊里。

By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other story, beast with two backs?
顺便问一下，他是怎么发现的？他在睡梦中死去。或者另一个故事，有两个背的野兽？

—What was that? the professor asked.
-那是什么？教授问道。

ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
意大利，MAGISTRA ARTIUM

—He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O’Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the lex talionis. And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.
——J. J. 奥莫洛伊说，他谈到了证据法，谈到了罗马司法与早期马赛克法典“以牙还牙”的对​​比。他还引用了梵蒂冈米开朗基罗的摩西。

—Ha.
-哈。

—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!
——莱内汉开场白，说了几句精心挑选的话。安静！

Pause. J. J. O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.
暂停。 J·J·奥莫洛伊拿出烟盒。

False lull. Something quite ordinary.
虚假的平静。很普通的东西。

Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
信使若有所思地拿出火柴盒，点燃了雪茄。

I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.
从那时起，当我回顾那段奇怪的时光时，我常常想，正是那个本身微不足道的小举动，那场比赛，决定了我们俩一生的整个进程。

A POLISHED PERIOD
抛光时期

J. J. O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
J.J.奥莫洛伊继续说道：

—He said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live.
——他谈到它时说：那个在凝固的音乐中的石像，长着角，可怕，神圣的人类形态，智慧和预言的永恒象征，如果有的话，雕塑家的想象力或双手已经在灵魂的大理石上塑造了形象和灵魂变形的人值得活下去，值得活下去。

His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.
他纤细的手一挥，便回荡而落。

—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.
-美好的！迈尔斯·克劳福德立刻说道。

—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
——神圣的灵感，奥马登伯克先生说。

—You like it? J. J. O’Molloy asked Stephen.
-你喜欢它？ J.J.奥莫洛伊问斯蒂芬。

Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O’Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:
史蒂芬因优雅的语言和手势而热血沸腾，脸红了。他从烟盒里拿出一根香烟。 J.J.奥莫洛伊向迈尔斯·克劳福德提出了他的情况。莱内汉像以前一样点燃了香烟，接过奖杯说道：

—Muchibus thankibus.
—Muchibus 谢谢巴士。

A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
士气高昂的人

—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.’s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.
——马根尼斯教授正在跟我谈论你，J·J·奥莫洛伊对斯蒂芬说。你对那些与世隔绝的人群、蛋白石静谧诗人：A.E.神秘大师到底有何看法？是那个布拉瓦茨基女人开始的。她真是个老把戏。 A.E. 告诉一些美国佬的采访者，你在凌晨的时候来找他，向他询问关于意识层面的问题。马根尼斯认为你一定是在跟 A.E. 开玩笑。马格尼斯，他是一个士气最高的人。

Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about me? Don’t ask.
说到我。他说什么？他说什么？他对我说了什么？别问。

—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
——不，谢谢，麦克休教授说着，把烟盒挥到一边。稍等。让我说一件事。我听过的最精彩的演讲是约翰·F·泰勒在大学历史学会上的演讲。现任上诉法官菲茨吉本先生发表了讲话，辩论的论文是一篇主张复兴爱尔兰语的文章（当时是新文章）。

He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
他转向迈尔斯·克劳福德说道：

—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.
——你认识杰拉尔德·菲茨吉本。那么你可以想象他的演讲风格。

—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.
——据传言，他与蒂姆·希利 (Tim Healy) 坐在三一学院财产委员会中，J. J. 奥莫洛伊 (J. J. O’Molloy) 说。

—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock. Go on. Well?
——迈尔斯·克劳福德说，他坐在一件可爱的东西旁边，穿着一件儿童连衣裙。继续。出色地？

—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.
——请注意，教授说，这是一位出色的演说家的演讲，充满了彬彬有礼的傲慢，用经过训练的措辞倾注了他的愤怒，我不会说他的愤怒，而是将骄傲的人的蔑视倾注在新运动上。那时这是一个新的运动。我们很弱，因此毫无价值。

He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.
他立刻闭上了薄薄的嘴唇，但迫不及待地把一只张开的手举到眼镜上，用颤抖的拇指和无名指轻轻触碰黑框，将它​​们稳定在一个新的焦点上。

IMPROMPTU
即兴

In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:
他用平淡的语气对 J·J·奥莫洛伊说道：

—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.
——你必须知道，泰勒是在病床上来到这里的。我不相信他已经准备好了演讲，因为大厅里连一个速记员都没有。他黝黑、瘦削的脸周围长着蓬乱的胡须。他戴着一条宽松的白色丝绸领巾，总的来说，他看起来（尽管他不是）一个垂死的人。

His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
他的目光立刻从J·J·奥莫洛伊的脸上缓慢地转向斯蒂芬的脸，然后立刻弯下腰去寻找。他低下的头后面露出了未上釉的亚麻衣领，枯萎的头发弄脏了他的衣服。仍在寻找，他说：

—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.
——菲茨吉本的演讲结束后，约翰·泰勒起身回答。简而言之，我能想到的就是他的话。

He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.
他坚定地抬起头。他的眼睛再次思考起来。无知的贝类在粗大的镜头里来回游动，寻找出路。

He began:
他开始：

—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.
——主席先生、女士们、先生们：当我听到我博学的朋友刚才对爱尔兰青年发表的讲话时，我感到非常钦佩。在我看来，我仿佛被带到了一个远离这个国家的国家，进入了一个远离这个时代的时代，我站在古埃及，我正在听那片土地上的某个大祭司对年轻人的演讲。摩西。

His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let our crooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?
他的听众举着香烟准备听，他们的烟雾随着他的演讲而在脆弱的烟蒂中升腾。并让我们的歪烟。高贵的话来了。小心。你能亲自尝试一下吗？

—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me.
——我似乎听到了那位埃及大祭司的声音，语气既傲慢又骄傲。我听到了他的话，并且向我揭示了它们的含义。

FROM THE FATHERS
来自父辈

It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.
我得到启示，那些本来是好的东西，却会被腐蚀，如果它们是至善的，或者除非它们是好的，它们都不会被腐蚀。啊，诅咒你！那是圣奥古斯丁。

—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.
——你们犹太人为什么不接受我们的文化、我们的宗教和我们的语言？你们是一个游牧民族，我们是一个强大的民族。你们没有城市，也没有财富：我们的城市是人类的蜂巢，我们的三层战舰和四层战舰，满载着各种各样的商品，在已知地球的水域中划过一道沟渠。你们刚刚摆脱了原始条件：我们有文学、祭司、悠久的历史和政体。

Nile.
尼罗河。

Child, man, effigy.
孩子，男人，雕像。

By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.
尼罗河畔，婴儿们跪在芦苇丛中：一个在战斗中柔顺的人：石角、石须、铁石心肠。

—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.
——你向当地默默无闻的偶像祈祷：我们的神庙雄伟而神秘，是伊西斯和奥西里斯、荷鲁斯和阿蒙拉的住所。你的奴役、敬畏和谦卑：我们的雷霆和海洋。以色列弱小，子孙稀少；埃及是大军，其武器却可怕。你们被称为流浪者和散工：世界因我们的名字而颤抖。

A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:
饥饿打嗝打断了他的话。他大胆地提高了声音：

—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.
——但是，女士们先生们，如果年轻的摩西倾听并接受这种人生观，如果他在傲慢的警告面前低下头、低下自己的意志、低下自己的精神，他就永远不会把选民带出他们的家园。束缚，白天也不追随云柱。他永远不会在西奈山山顶的闪电中与永恒者交谈，也永远不会带着灵感之光在他的脸上闪耀，并在他的怀里抱着用亡命之徒的语言刻成的法典。

He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.
他停下来看着他们，享受着沉默。

OMINOUS—FOR HIM!
对他来说是不祥的！

J. J. O’Molloy said not without regret:
J. J. O’Molloy 不无遗憾地说道：

—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.
——然而他还没有进入应许之地就死了。

—A sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness— often—previously—expectorated—demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future behind him.
——然而——突然——在——那一刻——因——挥之不去的——疾病——通常是——以前——预期的——死亡，莱内汉补充道。他身后还有美好的未来。

The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.
听见一群光着脚的人沿着走廊奔跑，啪嗒啪嗒地走上楼梯。

—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of porches. The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.
——这是演讲，教授毫无矛盾地说道。随风而逝。穆拉格玛斯特和国王塔拉的主人。数英里长的门廊耳朵。保民官的话，呼啸而散，四风四散。一群人被他的声音所庇护。死寂的噪音。阿卡西记录了无论何时何地发生的一切。爱他并赞美他：我不再是我了。

I have money.
我有钱。

—Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?
——先生们，斯蒂芬说。作为议程文件上的下一个动议，我可以建议众议院现在休会吗？

—You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? Mr O’Madden Burke asked. ‘Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.
-你带走了我的呼吸。这也许不是法国人的恭维话？奥马登·伯克先生问道。我想，从隐喻上来说，现在正是酒壶在古老的旅馆里最感激的时候。

—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To which particular boosing shed? … My casting vote is: Mooney’s!
——就这样，特此坚决解决。莱内汉宣布，所有赞成的人都说好。反之则不然。我宣布它携带。到哪个特定的嘘声棚？ ……我的决定票是：穆尼的！

He led the way, admonishing:
他在前面带路，劝诫道：

—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes, we will not. By no manner of means.
——我们将坚决拒绝喝烈水，不是吗？是的，我们不会。无论如何。

Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella:
紧随其后的奥马登·伯克先生以盟友般的方式举起雨伞说道：

—Lay on, Macduff!
——躺着，麦克德夫！

—Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?
——旧街区的芯片！编辑拍着斯蒂芬的肩膀哭了。让我们去。那些该死的钥匙在哪里？

He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.
他在口袋里摸索着掏出压碎的打字纸。

—Foot and mouth. I know. That’ll be all right. That’ll go in. Where are they? That’s all right.
——脚和嘴。我知道。这样就可以了。那会进去的。他们在哪里？没关系。

He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.
他把床单推开，走进里面的办公室。

LET US HOPE
让我们希望

J. J. O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:
J·J·奥莫洛伊正要跟着他进去，轻声对斯蒂芬说：

—I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.
——我希望你能活着看到它出版。迈尔斯，等一下。

He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.
他走进里面的办公室，关上了身后的门。

—Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn’t it? It has the prophetic vision. Fuit Ilium! The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.
——来吧，斯蒂芬，教授说。那很好，不是吗？它具有预言性的异象。伊利姆！风大的特洛伊被洗劫一空。这个世界的王国。今天，地中海的主人都是农民。

The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling:
第一个报童跟在他们后面，啪嗒啪嗒地走下楼梯，冲到街上，喊道：

—Racing special!
——赛车特别！

Dublin. I have much, much to learn.
都柏林。我还有很多很多要学。

They turned to the left along Abbey street.
他们沿着修道院街向左转。

—I have a vision too, Stephen said.
——我也有一个愿景，斯蒂芬说。

—Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will follow.
-是的？教授说着，跳了起来。克劳福德将紧随其后。

Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
另一个报童从他们身边跑过，一边跑一边喊道：

—Racing special!
——赛车特别！

DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
亲爱的肮脏的都柏林

Dubliners.
都柏林人。

—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.
——史蒂芬说，都柏林的两位贞女，年长而虔诚，在富姆巴利的小巷里已经生活了五十年和五十三年了。

—Where is that? the professor asked.
-哪里是？教授问道。

—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.
——在布莱克皮茨附近，斯蒂芬说。

Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker, darlint!
潮湿的夜晚散发着饥饿面团的臭味。靠在墙上。她的粗布披肩下，脸庞闪闪发亮。狂乱的心。阿卡西记录。快点，亲爱的！

On now. Dare it. Let there be life.
现在就开始吧敢吧。要有生命。

—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar. They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.
——他们想从纳尔逊柱子的顶端看到都柏林的景色。他们在一个红锡信箱存钱罐里存了三便士。他们把三便士和六便士抖出来，然后用刀刃把便士哄出来。二和三是银币，一和七是铜币。他们戴上帽子，穿上最好的衣服，带上雨伞，生怕下雨。

—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.
——聪明的处女，麦克休教授说。

LIFE ON THE RAW
原始生活

—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress … They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.
——他们在马尔伯勒街北城餐厅的老板娘凯特·柯林斯小姐那里买了价值一先四便士的牛肉和四片面包……他们从纳尔逊柱子脚下的一个女孩那里买了四到二十个成熟的李子，以解渴。肌肉。他们把两枚三便士的硬币交给十字转门处的绅士，然后开始慢慢地摇摇晃晃地爬上蜿蜒的楼梯，咕哝着，互相鼓励，害怕黑暗，气喘吁吁，一个问另一个有你的肌肉，赞美上帝和圣母，威胁要下来，偷看气缝。荣耀归于上帝。他们不知道它有这么高。

Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.
他们的名字是安妮·卡恩斯和弗洛伦斯·麦克凯布。安妮·卡恩斯（Anne Kearns）患有腰痛，她用卢尔德水擦治疗，这是一位女士从一位热情的父亲那里得到一瓶水给她的。弗洛伦斯·麦克凯布 (Florence MacCabe) 每周六都会带一个小酒瓶和一瓶双 X 作为晚餐。

—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can see them. What’s keeping our friend?
——对立面，教授点了两下头说道。维斯塔贞女。我能看到他们。是什么让我们的朋友留了下来？

He turned.
他转过身来。

A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J. J. O’Molloy.
一群报童蹦蹦跳跳地冲下台阶，四散奔逃，大喊大叫，白纸飘扬。紧随其后，迈尔斯·克劳福德出现在台阶上，他的帽子遮住了他猩红的脸，正在与 J·J·奥莫洛伊交谈。

—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.
——来吧，教授挥舞着手臂喊道。

He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.
他再次出发，走在斯蒂芬身边。

RETURN OF BLOOM
绽放回归

—Yes, he said. I see them.
——是的，他说。我看到他们。

Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal, called:
布鲁姆先生气喘吁吁地陷入爱尔兰天主教报和都柏林便士报办公室附近疯狂报童的漩涡中，他打电话道：

—Mr Crawford! A moment!
——克劳福德先生！片刻！

—Telegraph! Racing special!
-电报！赛车专用！

—What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.
-它是什么？迈尔斯·克劳福德向后退了一步说道。

A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:
一个报童当着布鲁姆先生的面哭道：

—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
——拉斯矿井发生了可怕的悲剧！一个孩子被风箱咬了！

INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
编辑专访

—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes just now. He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he’ll see. But he wants a par to call attention in the Telegraph too, the Saturday pink. And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the Kilkenny People. I can have access to it in the national library. House of keys, don’t you see? His name is Keyes. It’s a play on the name. But he practically promised he’d give the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?
——就这则广告，布卢姆先生一边说着，一边气喘吁吁地走向台阶，从口袋里掏出剪报。我刚才和凯斯先生谈过。他说，他将续约两个月。之后他就会看到。但他也希望有一个标准杆能够引起《电讯报》的注意，即周六粉红色。我告诉基尔肯尼人民议员南内蒂，如果还不算太晚的话，他希望复制它。我可以在国家图书馆找到它。钥匙屋，你没看到吗？他的名字叫凯斯。这是一个名字上的游戏。但他实际上承诺会续约。但他想要的只是一点点。我要告诉他什么，克劳福德先生？

K.M.A.

—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.
——你能告诉他他可以亲我的屁股吗？迈尔斯·克劳福德伸出手臂以示强调。直接从马厩告诉他。

A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm. Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?
有点紧张。留意暴风雨。都出去喝一杯了手挽手。莱内汉的游艇帽放在远处的小船上。平常的巧言。令人惊奇的是年轻的代达勒斯的动人精神。他今天穿了一双很好的靴子。上次我见到他时，他露出了高跟鞋。一直在某处的淤泥中行走。粗心的家伙。他在爱尔兰镇做什么？

—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it’s worth a short par. He’d give the ad, I think. I’ll tell him …
——好吧，布卢姆先生说，他的眼睛又转了过来，如果我能得到这个设计，我想它的价值是短标准杆。我想他会做广告的。我会告诉他 …

K.M.R.I.A.

—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.
——他可以亲吻我爱尔兰皇家的屁股，迈尔斯·克劳福德在他的肩膀上大声喊道。只要他愿意，就告诉他。

While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily.
布卢姆先生站在那里权衡要点，正要微笑，但他却摇摇晃晃地大步向前走去。

RAISING THE WIND
扬帆起航

—Nulla bona, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I’m up to here. I’ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.
——Nulla bona，杰克，他说着，抬起手托着下巴。我就到这里了。我自己也经历过困境。我正在寻找一个不晚于上周为我支持一项法案的人。对不起，杰克。你必须以意志为行动。无论如何，只要我能鼓起风来，我就心怀半心。

J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up on the others and walked abreast.
J·J·奥莫洛伊板着脸，默默地走着。他们追上了其他人，并肩而行。

—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.
——当他们吃完牛肉和面包，并用包着面包的纸擦了擦二十个手指后，他们就靠近栏杆了。

—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.
——给你一些东西，教授向迈尔斯·克劳福德解释道。纳尔逊柱子顶上有两个都柏林老妇人。

SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
某篇专栏！——摇摇晃晃的人是这么说的

—That’s new, Myles Crawford said. That’s copy. Out for the waxies Dargle. Two old trickies, what?
——这是新的，迈尔斯·克劳福德说。那是副本。出去寻找蜡质达格尔。两个老把戏，什么？

—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’ blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s. But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts …
——但他们担心柱子会倒塌，斯蒂芬继续说道。他们看到屋顶并争论不同教堂的位置：拉思曼斯的蓝色圆顶、亚当和夏娃的教堂、圣劳伦斯·奥图尔的教堂。但这让她们看起来头晕，所以她们拉起裙子……

THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
那些有点闹腾的女性

—Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We’re in the archdiocese here.
——很简单，迈尔斯·克劳福德说。没有诗意许可。我们在这里的总教区。

—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.
——然后坐在条纹衬裙上，抬头凝视着单手通奸者的雕像。

—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea. I see what you mean.
——独奸大夫！教授哭了。我喜欢。我明白这个想法了。我明白你的意思了。

DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
女士们捐赠都柏林的 CITS Speedpills Velocitous Aeroliths，信念

—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.
——斯蒂芬说，这让他们脖子一僵，他们太累了，无法抬头或低头，也无法说话。他们把一袋李子夹在中间，一个接一个地吃着里面的李子，用手帕擦去从嘴里流出来的李子汁，把李子慢慢地从栏杆之间吐出来。

He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O’Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.
他突然发出一声年轻的大笑作为结束。莱内汉和奥马登·伯克先生听到了，转身向穆尼家走去。

—Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.
-完成的？迈尔斯·克劳福德说道。只要他们不做更糟的事情。

SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.
智者用长鼻猛击傲慢的海伦·广场。斯巴达战士咬牙切齿。伊萨卡人誓言笔是冠军。

—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.
——你让我想起了安提斯泰尼，教授说，他是智者高尔吉亚的弟子。据说，没人知道他是对别人更怨恨，还是对自己更怨恨。他是一个贵族和一个婢女的儿子。他写了一本书，从阿尔吉夫·海伦手中夺走了美丽的棕榈树，并将其交给了可怜的佩内洛普。

Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.
可怜的佩内洛普。佩内洛普·里奇.

They made ready to cross O’Connell street.
他们准备穿过奥康奈尔街。

HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!
你好，中央！

At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.
在八条线路的不同地点，停着电车的有轨电车停在轨道上，往返于拉思曼斯、拉思法纳姆、布莱克罗克、金斯敦和达尔基、桑迪蒙特格林、林森德和桑迪蒙特塔、唐尼布鲁克、帕默斯顿公园和上拉斯曼斯，一切都静止了，平静的处于短路状态。哈克尼汽车、出租车、运货马车、邮车、私人马车、充气矿泉水漂浮物，上面装满了嘎嘎作响的瓶子，嘎嘎作响、滚动、马拉着，速度很快。

WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?
什么？同样，在哪里？

—But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the plums?
——但是你怎么称呼它呢？迈尔斯·克劳福德问道。他们从哪里得到李子？

VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.
维吉利安，教师说。老摩西的大二学生。

—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: deus nobis haec otia fecit.
——就这样吧，等等，教授说，张开长嘴唇思考。打电话给我看看。称之为：deus nobis haec otia fecit。

—No, Stephen said. I call it A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or the Parable of The Plums.
——不，斯蒂芬说。我把它称为“巴勒斯坦的皮斯加景象”或“李子的寓言”。

t

—I see, the professor said.
——我明白了，教授说。

He laughed richly.
他笑得很灿烂。

—I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land. We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O’Molloy.
——原来如此，他又带着新的喜悦说道。摩西和应许之地。 “我们给了他这个想法，”他向 J. J. O’Molloy 补充道。

HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
霍拉旭在这个六月的公平日受到关注

J. J. O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace.
J·J·奥莫洛伊疲倦地斜视雕像一眼，沉默不语。

—I see, the professor said.
——我明白了，教授说。

He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.
他在约翰·格雷爵士的人行道岛上停了下来，透过他苦笑着的网格，凝视着高处的纳尔逊。

DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES, FLO WANGLES—YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?
事实证明，减少的数字对于欢快的欢快来说太刺激了。安妮·温布尔斯、弗洛·旺格斯——你能责怪他们吗？

—Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must say.
——一个奸夫，他阴沉地笑着说道。我必须说，这让我很痒。

—Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’s truth was known.
——迈尔斯·克劳福德说，如果全能上帝的真相被人知道的话，老人们也会开心。

Bloo … Me? No.
布卢……我？不。

Blood of the Lamb.
羔羊的血。

His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen, martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering, druids’ altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of the church in Zion is coming.
他缓慢的脚步带着他向河边走去，一边读书。你得救了吗？一切都被羔羊的血洗净了。上帝想要血腥受害者。出生、处女膜、殉道、战争、奠基、牺牲、肾火祭、德鲁伊祭坛。以利亚来了。锡安教堂的修复者约翰·亚历山大·道伊博士即将到来。

Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!!
来了！来了！！来了！！！

All heartily welcome.
各界人士表示热烈欢迎。

Paying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put the stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous crucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the wall, hanging. Pepper’s ghost idea. Iron nails ran in.
付费游戏。托里和亚历山大去年。一夫多妻制。他的妻子会阻止这一切。伯明翰某个公司的发光十字架广告在哪里？我们的救世主。夜深人静的时候醒来，看到他挂在墙上。佩珀的鬼主意。铁钉钻了进去。

Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the pantry in the kitchen. Don’t like all the smells in it waiting to rush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good for the brain.
必须用磷来完成。例如，如果你留下一点鳕鱼。我可以看到上面有蓝银色。晚上我去了厨房的食品储藏室。不喜欢里面所有的气味都等着冲出去。她想要什么？马拉加葡萄干。想到西班牙。在鲁迪出生之前。磷光，蓝绿色。对大脑非常有好处。

From Butler’s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor’s walk. Dedalus’ daughter there still outside Dillon’s auctionrooms. Must be selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father. Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That’s in their theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I’d like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear he’d collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting l.s.d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one. Watching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence: mum’s the word.
从巴特勒纪念馆的角落里，他沿着学士街望去。迪达勒斯的女儿仍在狄龙的拍卖行外面。肯定是要卖掉一些旧家具了。她的眼神立刻就认出了父亲。游说着等他。当母亲离开时，家总是支离破碎。他有十五个孩子。几乎每年都会出生。这是他们的神学，否则牧师不会给这个可怜的女人忏悔和赦免。增加并倍增。你听过这样的想法吗？吃掉你的家和家。没有家人自己养活。靠土地肥沃为生。他们的黄油和食品储藏室。我希望看到他们进行黑色斋戒赎罪日。十字面包。一顿饭和一份整理，生怕他会倒在祭坛上。如果你能从她身上找出来的话，她就是其中一个人的管家。永远不要从她身上挑出它。就像得到迷幻药一样。从他身上。自己做得很好。没有客人。一切都是为了第一。看着他的水。带上自己的面包和黄油。他的尊敬：妈妈的话。

Good Lord, that poor child’s dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It’s after they feel it. Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.
天啊，那个可怜的孩子的衣服已经破烂不堪了。她看起来也吃不饱。土豆和玛吉，玛吉和土豆。是在他们感觉到之后。布丁的证明。破坏宪法。

As he set foot on O’Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it, I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.
当他踏上奥康奈尔桥时，一股马勃烟雾从栏杆上升起。出口黑啤酒的啤酒驳船。英格兰。我听说，海水会使空气变酸。有一天，你会很有趣，获得一张穿过汉考克的通行证，参观啤酒厂。正常的世界本身。大桶的搬运工很棒。老鼠也进来了。喝得自己肿得像牧羊犬一样大漂浮着。醉倒在搬运工身上。喝到他们再次像基督徒一样呕吐为止。想象一下喝那个！老鼠：缸。好吧，当然，如果我们知道所有的事情的话。

Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J’s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It’s the droll way he comes out with the things. Knows how to tell a story too.
低头一看，他看到了海鸥，它们用力拍打着翅膀，在荒凉的岸墙之间盘旋。外面天气恶劣。如果我摔倒了呢？鲁本·J 的儿子肯定吞下了一大肚子的污水。一又八便士太多了。呵呵。这是他处理事情的滑稽方式。也知道如何讲故事。

They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.
他们把轮子降得更低。寻找幼虫。等待。

He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin’s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.
他把一个皱巴巴的纸团扔到他们中间。以利亚每秒三十二英尺是com。一点也不。球在海浪的尾流中无人注意地上下浮动，漂浮在桥墩下方。才不是这么该死的傻瓜。就在我把那块不新鲜的蛋糕从艾琳之王号上扔出去的那天，我在船尾五十码处捡起了它。靠他们的智慧生活。它们盘旋、拍动翅膀。

The hungry famished gull
饥饿的海鸥

Flaps o’er the waters dull.
水面沉闷。

That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts. Solemn.
这就是诗人的写作方式，相似的声音。但莎士比亚没有押韵：无韵诗。它就是语言的流动。的想法。庄严。

Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit
哈姆雷特，我是你父亲的灵魂

Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.
注定要在地球上行走一段时间。

—Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!
——一便士两个苹果！一分钱两个！

His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief.
他的目光扫过她摊子上排列着的釉面苹果。澳大利亚人一定是每年的这个时候。闪亮的果皮：用抹布或手帕将其擦亮。

Wait. Those poor birds.
等待。那些可怜的鸟儿。

He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.
他又停下来，花一便士从老苹果婆那里买了两个班伯里蛋糕，然后把易碎的糊状物弄碎，把碎片扔进了利菲河。看到了吗？海鸥悄无声息地飞来，两只，然后全部从高处扑向猎物。走了。每一口。

Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.
意识到他们的贪婪和狡猾，他甩掉了手中的粉末状面包屑。他们万万没想到会这样。吗哪。以鱼为生，他们有鱼肉，所有海鸟，海鸥，海雁。安娜·利菲 (Anna Liffey) 的天鹅有时会游到这里来打扮自己。不考虑口味。想知道什么是天鹅肉。鲁宾逊·克鲁索必须靠它们生活。

They wheeled flapping weakly. I’m not going to throw any more. Penny quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? How is that?
它们拍打着翅膀微弱地转动着。我不会再扔了。佩妮够了。我得到很多感谢。连一声叫声都没有。他们还传播口蹄疫。如果你把一只火鸡塞进栗子粉里，它的味道就是那样。像猪一样吃猪。但为什么咸水鱼不咸呢？那个怎么样？

His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.
他的眼睛从河里寻找答案，看到一艘划艇停泊在岩石上，它的石膏板懒洋洋地膨胀着。

Kino’s 11/Trousers
Kino’s 11/裤子

Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own water really? It’s always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn’t cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.
好主意。不知道他是否向公司支付租金。你怎么能真正拥有水呢？它总是像一条溪流一样流动，永远不一样，我们在生命的溪流中追寻着它。因为生命是一条溪流。各种地方都适合投放广告。那个鼓掌的江湖医生曾经被困在所有的温室里。现在再也见不到了。严格保密。海·弗兰克斯博士。没有让他像舞蹈大师马金尼的自我广告一样红。让其他人把它们贴出来，或者自己把它们贴在q上。 t。跑进去松开按钮。红眼航班。也只是这个地方。请勿发布账单。服用 110 粒药丸后。某个小伙子用了剂量灼伤了他。

If he …?
如果他 …？

O!

Eh?
呃？

No … No.
不，不。

No, no. I don’t believe it. He wouldn’t surely?
不，不。我不相信。他肯定不会吗？

No, no.
不，不。

Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball’s. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There’s a priest. Could ask him. Par it’s Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration. O rocks!
布卢姆先生向前走去，抬起他困惑的眼睛。别再想这个了。一后。镇流器办公室的时间球已关闭。邓辛克时间。罗伯特·鲍尔爵士的一本引人入胜的小书。视差。我一直没有完全理解。有一个牧师。可以问他。 Par是希腊语：平行、视差。遇见他她称之为长矛软管，直到我告诉她关于轮回的事情。岩石啊！

Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She’s right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound. She’s not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking. Still, I don’t know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn’t that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.
布卢姆先生对着镇流器办公室的两扇窗户微笑着哦，岩石。毕竟她是对的。由于声音的原因，只能用大词来形容普通的事物。她并不十分机智。也可能很粗鲁。脱口而出我的想法。尽管如此，我还是不知道。她常说本·多拉德的声音很低沉。他的腿像桶一样，你会以为他是在对着桶唱歌。现在，这不是机智吗？他们过去叫他大本。还不如称他为卑鄙的桶音那么机智。食欲如信天翁。走出牛肉男爵。他是一个强大的人，擅长偷走排名第一的巴斯。低音桶。看？一切顺利。

A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely’s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no, M Glade’s men. Doesn’t bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she’s writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn’t have it of course because he didn’t think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can’t lick ‘em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can’t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by Hely’s Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart’s broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker’s daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.
一队穿着白色罩衫的三明治人沿着排水沟慢慢向他走来，猩红色的腰带横在他们的木板上。便宜货。就像今天早上的那位牧师一样：我们犯了罪：我们受苦了。他读到了他们五顶白色高帽子上的红字：H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely 的。落在后面的Y从前板下摸出一块面包，塞进嘴里，边走边嚼。我们的主食。一天三个鲍勃，沿着阴沟走，一条又一条街。只要将皮和骨保持在一起，面包和技巧就可以了。他们不是博伊尔：不，M Glade 的人。也没有带来任何生意。我向他建议了一个透明的展示车，里面有两个聪明的女孩坐在里面写信、抄写本、信封、吸墨纸。我敢打赌这会流行起来。聪明的女孩写出一些东西立刻就会吸引眼球。每个人都渴望知道她在写什么。如果你什么也不看，就让二十个在你周围。多管闲事。女人也一样。好奇心。盐柱。当然不会，因为他自己首先没有想到这一点。或者我建议的带有黑色赛璐珞假污渍的墨水瓶。他对像 Plumtree’s 这样的广告的想法被放在讣告、冷肉部门的下面。你不能舔它们。什么？我们的信封。你好，琼斯，你要去哪里？不能停下来，罗宾逊，我正赶紧购买唯一可靠的 inkeraser Kansell，由位于达姆街 85 号的 Hely’s Ltd 出售。我已经摆脱困境了。收集那些修道院的账目是一项魔鬼般的工作。特兰基拉修道院。那是一位很漂亮的修女，面容非常甜美。温普尔很适合她的小脑袋。姐姐？姐姐？我确信她的眼神里充满了爱意。跟这样的女人讨价还价是很难的。那天早上我因她的灵修而打扰了她。 但很高兴能与外界交流。我们伟大的一天，她说。迦密山圣母盛宴。名字也很甜蜜：焦糖。她认识我，我想她通过她的方式认识我。如果她结婚了，她就会改变。我想他们确实缺钱。同样用最好的黄油煎所有的东西。他们没有猪油。我的心碎了，吃着滴水。他们喜欢进进出出。莫莉掀起面纱，品尝着它。姐姐？帕特·克拉菲，当铺老板的女儿。他们说是一位修女发明了铁丝网。

He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom’s. Got the job in Wisdom Hely’s year we married. Six years. Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that’s right the big fire at Arnott’s. Val Dillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O’Reilly emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman. Couldn’t hear what the band played. For what we have already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with selfcovered buttons. She didn’t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies’ picnic too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we had that day. People looking after her.
当撇号 S 缓慢地走过时，他穿过威斯特摩兰街。罗孚自行车店。这些比赛今天举行。那是多久以前的事了？菲尔·吉利根去世的那一年。我们在朗伯德街西边。等等：在汤姆家。我们结婚那年，威士德姆·海利找到了这份工作。六年。十年前：九十四岁他死了，是的，那就是阿诺特的大火。瓦尔·狄龙 (Val Dillon) 担任市长。格伦克里晚餐。市议员罗伯特·奥莱利在国旗落下之前将波特酒倒进汤里。鲍勃为内部市议员拍了拍。听不到乐队演奏的内容。因为我们已经领受的，愿主塑造我们。那时米莉还是个小孩子。莫莉穿着那件带有青蛙辫子的象灰色连衣裙。采用自包纽扣设计。她不喜欢它，因为她穿着唱诗班去舒格洛夫野餐的第一天我扭伤了脚踝。就好像那样。老古德温的高帽子上沾满了一些粘糊糊的东西。苍蝇的野餐也是如此。千万不要像这样把衣服穿在她的背上。像手套一样贴合她的肩膀和臀部。刚刚开始让它变得丰满起来。那天我们吃了兔子派。人们照顾她。

Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper. Dockrell’s, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly’s tubbing night. American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa’s daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.
快乐的。那就更幸福了。舒适的小房间，贴着红色壁纸。多克雷尔的，一打九便士。米莉的洗澡之夜。我买的美国肥皂：接骨木花。洗澡水的味道很舒服。有趣的是，她看起来浑身都是肥皂。身材也好。现在摄影。他告诉我的是可怜的爸爸的银版照相工作室。遗传的品味。

He walked along the curbstone.
他沿着路边石走着。

Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron’s saint Kevin’s parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen …? Of course it’s years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he sees every day.
生命之流。那个在他经过时总是眯着眼睛看着的牧师叫什么名字？女人，眼神无力。停在香橼的圣凯文游行中。写点东西。彭丹尼斯？我的记忆力越来越强。笔 …？当然那是几年前的事了。可能是电车的噪音。好吧，如果他记不起每天见到的父亲的名字的话。

Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song Winds that blow from the south.
巴特尔·达西是男高音，当时刚刚出道。训练结束后送她回家。留着打蜡的小胡子，自负的家伙。给她那首歌《风从南方吹来》。

Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn’t. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.
那是一个大风的夜晚，我去接她，在古德温的音乐会之后，在豪宅的晚餐室或橡木室举行的分会会议正在讨论那些彩票问题。我和他在后面。她的乐谱从我手中飞到了高中的栏杆上。幸运的是没有。这样的事情破坏了她夜晚的效果。古德温教授将她连在前面。他的针脚摇摇晃晃，可怜的老酒鬼。他的告别音乐会。肯定是最后一次出现在任何舞台上。可能会持续几个月，也可能永远不会。记得她对着风大笑，她的暴风雪衣领竖起来。夏悫道的拐角处还记得那股阵风。呜呜！炸毁了她所有的裙子和围巾，差点让老古德温窒息。她确实被风吹得脸红了。记得当我们回到家时，我们把火堆起来，用她喜欢的酸辣酱煎那些羊腿肉作为她的晚餐。还有热朗姆酒。可以看到她在卧室里的炉边松开她的窗帘：白色。

Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night …
她的身体在床上轻轻地翻动着。总是有她的温暖。总是喜欢释放自我。坐在那里直到快两点才摘下发夹。米莉躺在卧室里。快乐的。快乐的。那天晚上……

—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?
——哦，布鲁姆先生，你好吗？

—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?
——哦，你好吗，布林夫人？

—No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven’t seen her for ages.
——抱怨没有用。莫莉那段时间怎么样？好久没见到她了。

—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.
——穿着粉红色衣服的布卢姆先生高兴地说。你知道，米莉在穆林加尔有一个职位。

—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?
-离开！这对她来说不是很伟大吗？

—Yes. In a photographer’s there. Getting on like a house on fire. How are all your charges?
-是的。在摄影师那里。就像一座着火的房子一样。你们的各项费用都怎么样了？

—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.
——都在面包师的清单上，布林夫人说。

How many has she? No other in sight.
她有几个？看不见其他人。

—You’re in black, I see. You have no …
——我明白了，你穿的是黑色衣服。你没有……

—No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.
——不，布鲁姆先生说。我刚参加完葬礼。

Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who’s dead, when and what did he die of? Turn up like a bad penny.
我预见，这一整天都会出现。谁死了，他什么时候死的，死于什么？像劣币一样出现。

—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn’t any near relation.
——哦，天哪，布林夫人说。我希望这不是任何近亲关系。

May as well get her sympathy.
也能得到她的同情。

—Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.
——迪格南，布卢姆先生说。我的一个老朋友。他死得很突然，可怜的家伙。我相信是心脏病。葬礼是今天早上举行的。

Your funeral’s tomorrow
你的葬礼明天举行

While you’re coming through the rye.
当你穿过黑麦时。

Diddlediddle dumdum
迪迪迪德达姆

Diddlediddle …
迪迪迪…

—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.
——布林夫人的女人眼里忧郁地说道，失去了这些老朋友，我感到很难过。

Now that’s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.
现在就足够了。只是：静静地：老公。

—And your lord and master?
——那你的主人呢？

Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn’t lost them anyhow.
布林夫人睁大了两只大眼睛。无论如何都没有失去他们。

—O, don’t be talking! she said. He’s a caution to rattlesnakes. He’s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.
——哎呀，别说话了！她说。他是响尾蛇的警告。他现在拿着法律书在那里查明诽谤罪的法律。他让我心如刀割。等我给你看。

Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison’s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they’d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.
热腾腾的海龟蒸气和新出炉的果酱果酱的蒸气从哈里森店里喷涌而出。浓浓的正午气息让布卢姆先生的喉咙发痒。想要制作美味的糕点，黄油，最好的面粉，德梅拉拉糖，否则他们会和热茶一起品尝。还是来自她？一个赤脚的阿拉伯人站在栅栏上，呼吸着烟雾。这样就能减轻饥饿的折磨。是快乐还是痛苦？便士晚餐。刀叉被拴在桌子上。

Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things. Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging. Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little brother’s family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she? …
打开她的手提包，皮革破损了。 Hatpin：应该对这些东西保持警惕。把它塞进电车里一个人的眼睛里。翻找。打开。钱。请拿一张。如果他们失去六便士，那就见鬼了。培养该隐。老公闯。星期一我给你的十先令在哪里？你在养活你弟弟的家人吗？脏手帕：药瓶。掉落的锭剂。她是什么？ ……

—There must be a new moon out, she said. He’s always bad then. Do you know what he did last night?
——肯定会有新月出来，她说。那时他总是很糟糕。你知道他昨晚做了什么吗？

Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.
她的手不再翻找。她的眼睛注视着他，惊恐地睁大眼睛，却又微笑着。

—What? Mr Bloom asked.
-什么？布鲁姆先生问道。

Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.
让她说话。直视她的眼睛。我相信你。相信我。

—Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.
——半夜把我吵醒，她说。他做了一个梦，一场噩梦。

Indiges.
靛蓝。

—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.
——说黑桃 A 正在上楼梯。

—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
-黑桃A！布鲁姆先生说道。

She took a folded postcard from her handbag.
她从手提包里拿出一张折叠好的明信片。

—Read that, she said. He got it this morning.
——读一下，她说。他今天早上收到了。

—What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?
-它是什么？布鲁姆先生接过名片问道。向上。？

—U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It’s a great shame for them whoever he is.
—U.P.：向上，她说。有人从他身上崛起。无论他是谁，这对他们来说都是莫大的耻辱。

—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.
——确实如此，布鲁姆先生说。

She took back the card, sighing.
她收回卡片，叹了口气。

—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office. He’s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.
——现在他要去芒顿先生的办公室。他说，他将采取行动，争取一万英镑。

She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.
她把卡片折进她凌乱的包里，然后扣上搭扣。

Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.
两年前她穿的那件蓝色哔叽连衣裙，绒毛已经漂白了。看到了最好的日子。稀疏的头发遮住耳朵。还有那顶破旧的无边帽：三颗老葡萄可以消除它的伤害。破旧的文雅。她曾经是一个很有品味的梳妆台。她的嘴角有皱纹。只比莫莉大一岁左右。

See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.
看到那个女人向她投来的目光，掠过。残忍的。不公平的性行为。

He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I’m hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle’s long ago. Dolphin’s Barn, the charades. U.P.: up.
他一动不动地看着她，脸上隐藏着不满。辛辣的海龟牛尾 Mulligatawny。我也饿了。她裙子的衬料上有糕点片：她的脸颊上粘着一层糖粉。大黄挞，馅料丰富，果香浓郁。乔西·鲍威尔就是这样。很久以前在卢克·道尔的作品中。海豚谷仓，猜谜语。 UP：向上。

Change the subject.
改变主题。

—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.
——你见过博福伊夫人的任何情况吗？布鲁姆先生问道。

—Mina Purefoy? she said.
——米娜·普尔弗伊？她说。

Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers’ Club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.
我在想菲利普·博福伊。玩客俱乐部。玛查姆经常想到主线。我拉动链条了吗？是的。最后一幕。

—Yes.
-是的。

—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She’s in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She’s three days bad now.
——我刚刚在进来的路上打电话询问她是否已经结束了。她在霍尔斯街的产科医院里。霍恩医生让她进来了。她已经病了三天了。

—O, Mr Bloom said. I’m sorry to hear that.
——哦，布卢姆先生说。听到这个消息我很遗憾。

—Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It’s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.
——是的，布林夫人说。家里还有一屋子的孩子。护士告诉我，这是一次非常艰难的分娩。

—-O, Mr Bloom said.
——哦，布卢姆先生说。

His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!
他浓重的怜悯目光吸收了她的消息。他的舌头发出怜悯的声音。呸！呸！

—I’m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That’s terrible for her.
——听到这个消息我很遗憾，他说。可怜的东西！三天！这对她来说太可怕了。

Mrs Breen nodded.
布林夫人点点头。

—She was taken bad on the Tuesday …
——周二她受到了不好的对待……

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
布卢姆先生轻轻碰触她的滑骨，警告她：

—Mind! Let this man pass.
-头脑！让这个人过去吧。

A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.
一个瘦骨嶙峋的身影从河边沿着路边石大步走来，全神贯注地凝视着透过粗绳玻璃的阳光。一顶小帽子像头骨一样紧紧地扣住了他的头。他的手臂上挂着一件折叠好的风衣、一根棍子和一把雨伞，在他的大步上晃来晃去。

—Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!
——看着他，布卢姆先生说。他总是走在灯柱外面。手表！

—Who is he if it’s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?
——如果这是一个公平的问题，他是谁？布林夫人问道。他很傻吗？

—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch!
——他的名字是卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔，布卢姆先生微笑着说道。手表！

—He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.
——他已经受够了，她说。有一天，丹尼斯也会像那样。

She broke off suddenly.
她突然停了下来。

—There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won’t you?
——他在那儿，她说。我必须去追他。再见。记得我对莫莉说，好吗？

—I will, Mr Bloom said.
——我会的，布卢姆先生说。

He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison’s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.
他看着她躲过路人，朝店面走去。丹尼斯·布林穿着暴露的双排扣大衣和蓝色帆布鞋，拖着脚步从哈里森的办公室里走出来，两本厚重的书紧贴着他的肋骨。从海湾吹来的。像旧时一样。他毫无意外地让她追上了他，然后把暗灰色的胡须推向她，松松的下巴摇动着，认真地说着。

Meshuggah. Off his chump.
梅舒加。离开他的笨蛋。

Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world. And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have with him.
布卢姆先生又轻松地继续前行，在阳光下看到他前面那件紧身头骨，那件悬垂的棍状雨伞风衣。去这两天。看着他！他又出去了。在世界上生存的一种方式。还有那个穿着那些破烂衣服的老莫西疯子。她和他在一起一定很艰难。

U.P.: up. I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton’s office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.
UP：向上。我宣誓我是阿尔夫·伯根或里奇·古尔丁。写下这篇文章是为了在苏格兰房子里取乐，我敢打赌。绕到芒通的办公室。他牡蛎般的眼睛盯着明信片。成为众神的盛宴。

He passed the Irish Times. There might be other answers Iying there. Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn’t know me. O, leave them there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.
他通过了《爱尔兰时报》。那里可能还有其他答案。喜欢全部回答。对犯罪分子来说是一个良好的制度。代码。现在正在吃午饭。那里戴眼镜的店员不认识我。哦，把它们留在那里煮。费力地浏览其中的四十四个已经够麻烦的了。诚聘聪明的女打字员协助先生从事文学工作。我称你为顽皮的宝贝，因为我不喜欢那个另一个世界。请告诉我这是什么意思。请告诉我你妻子用的是什么香水。告诉我谁创造了世界。他们向你提出这些问题的方式。另一位是莉齐·特威格。我的文学努力有幸得到了著名诗人A.E.（吉奥.罗素先生）的认可。没有时间一边喝草茶一边看诗集打理头发。

Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big deal on Coates’s shares. Ca’ canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the Irish Field now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you’d say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn’t take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.
适合小广告的最佳长粉笔纸。现在已经拿到省份了厨师和将军，例外。料理，女仆保管。想要活人作为精神计数器。回复。女孩（R.C.）希望听到水果或猪肉店的职位。詹姆斯·卡莱尔做到了。百分之六半的股息。对科茨的股票做了一笔大交易。 Ca’精明。狡猾的苏格兰老帅哥。所有今日新闻。我们亲切而受欢迎的总督。现在买了爱尔兰田。蒙卡舍尔女士在出院后已经完全恢复，并在昨天拉索斯的扩建中与沃德联盟的猎犬一起骑行。不能吃的狐狸。猎人也一样。恐惧注入了汁液，让它们变得足够柔软。跨骑。像个男人一样坐她的马。负重的女猎人。她没有侧鞍或后座，乔也没有。第一个见面并在死亡时进来。那些骑马的女人中，有一些像一匹母马一样强壮。在马厩里大摇大摆地走来走去。当你说刀的时候，扔掉一杯干净的白兰地。今天早上在格罗夫纳的那个。和她一起上车：祝愿。石墙或五栅门将她的坐骑放在上面。认为那个脾气暴躁的司机是出于恶意才这样做的。她像谁？哦是啊！米里亚姆·丹德拉德夫人在谢尔本酒店卖给我她的旧围巾和黑色内衣。离婚的西班牙裔美国人。我对它们的处理丝毫没有影响到她。就好像我是她的晒衣架。当公园管理员斯塔布斯让我和快车的惠兰一起参加时，我在总督府的派对上看到了她。清理剩下的质量。下午茶。我把蛋黄酱倒在李子上，以为那是蛋奶冻。几周后她的耳朵应该会刺痛。想为她当牛。天生名妓。她不需要做保育工作，谢谢。

Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore’s cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t’s are. Dog in the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.
可怜的普尔弗伊夫人！卫理公会的丈夫。他的疯狂方法。在教育乳品店享用藏红花面包、牛奶和苏打水午餐。 Y.M.C.A.用秒表吃饭，每分钟咀嚼三十二次。但他的羊胡子仍然长着。据说连接良好。西奥多在都柏林城堡的表弟。每个家庭都有一位托尼亲戚。他送给她一年生的哈迪。看到他在三快乐顶上光着头游行，而他最大的儿子则在市场网里拎着一顶帽子。那些乱发脾气的人。可怜的东西！然后年复一年地整夜喂奶。这些人太自私了。马槽里的狗。如果你愿意的话，我的茶里只加一块糖。

He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at Rowe’s? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. Better. On my way.
他站在舰队街十字路口。午餐间隔。罗的六便士？必须在国家图书馆查找该广告。伯顿的八便士。更好的。我在途中。

He walked on past Bolton’s Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.
他走过博尔顿位于威斯特摩兰的房子。茶。茶。茶。我忘了点击汤姆·克南。

Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply! Child’s head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.
嘘。哒，哒，哒！三天后，想象一下她在床上呻吟，额头围着一块沾满醋的手帕，肚子肿胀起来。唷！简直可怕！孩子头太大：用镊子。她在她体内蜷缩起来，试图盲目地用屁股撞出去，摸索着出去。那就杀了我吧。幸运的莫莉轻松地克服了她的困难。他们应该发明一些东西来阻止这种情况。生活伴随着艰苦的劳动。黄昏睡眠的想法：维多利亚女王被赋予了这个想法。她有九个。一层不错。住在鞋子里的老妇人有很多孩子。假设他患有肺痨病。是时候有人思考一下这个问题了，而不是对那银色光辉的忧郁胸怀是什么感到气愤。用来喂傻瓜的胡言乱语。他们可以轻松地拥有大型机构，整个事情相当轻松，因为所有的税收都给每个出生的孩子五英镑，复利高达百分之二十一五，相当于一百先令，五英镑乘以十进制的二十，鼓励人们存钱一百一十二十一点想在纸上算出来的金额比你想象的要多。

Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.
当然不是死产。他们甚至没有注册。没事找事麻烦。

Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs Moisel. Mothers’ meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that’s nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall’s son. His first bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking them up at all hours. For God’ sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.
有趣的是，他们两个在一起，肚子都露出来了。莫莉和莫伊塞尔夫人。母亲们的聚会。肺结核暂时消失，然后又复发。他们突然看起来多么扁平。眼神平静。减轻他们的负担。老桑顿太太是一个快乐的老灵魂。我所有的孩子，她说。在喂它们之前，她嘴里放着一勺爸爸。噢，那是 nyumnyu​​m。她的手被老汤姆·沃尔的儿子压伤了。他第一次向公众鞠躬。头像奖品南瓜一样。斯纳菲·穆伦博士。人们随时都在敲打他们。看在上帝的份上，医生。妻子在痛苦中。然后让他们等待几个月的费用。去照顾你的妻子。人们没有感恩之心。大多数都是仁慈的医生。

Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here’s good luck. Must be thrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.
爱尔兰议会大厦巨大的高门前，一群鸽子飞过。饭后他们的小嬉戏。我们要对谁做呢？我选了那个穿黑衣服的人。开始。祝你好运。从空中看一定很刺激。阿普约翰、我和欧文·戈德堡在古斯格林附近的树上和猴子玩耍。他们叫我鲭鱼。

A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. Policeman’s lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.
一队警察从学院街出发，列队行进。正步。食物灼热的脸​​，头盔出汗，拍打着警棍。吃完后，他们的腰带下会灌满大量的肥汤。警察的命运往往是幸福的。他们分成三组，朝着各自的节奏散去，行礼。放出去吃草。布丁时间是进攻的最佳时机。他的晚餐中有一拳。一队其他人不规则地行进，绕过圣三一的栏杆，向车站走去。必将走向他们的低谷。准备迎接骑兵。准备接汤。

He crossed under Tommy Moore’s roguish finger. They did right to put him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. There is not in this wide world a vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan’s. Kept her voice up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe’s, wasn’t she?
他在汤米·摩尔恶作剧的手指下穿过。他们把他放在小便池上方是正确的：水的交汇处。应该是女性的地方。跑进蛋糕店。把我的帽子摆正。这广阔的世界上没有山谷。朱莉娅·莫坎的伟大歌曲。直到最后一刻她都保持着声音。她是迈克尔·巴尔夫的学生，不是吗？

He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. Can’t blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His horse’s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Manning’s or I was souped. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I oughtn’t to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he’s in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.
他凝视着最后一件宽大的束腰外衣。对付那些讨厌的顾客。杰克·鲍尔可以讲述一个故事：父亲是一名 G 人。如果一个家伙给他们带来了落后的麻烦，他们就会让他在新娘井里过得又热又重。毕竟不能责怪他们的工作，尤其是年轻的饥渴者。乔·张伯伦 (Joe Chamberlain) 在三一学院获得学位的那一天，那位骑警就受到了追捧。我的话他做到了！他的马蹄在修道院街上叮当作响地跟在我们后面。幸运的是，我有足够的头脑去潜入曼宁的世界，否则我就会被灌输。他确实给乔治带来了冲击。他的头骨一定是在鹅卵石上摔碎的。我不应该让自己沉迷于这些医疗。还有三一学院的学位帽上的三角帆。自找麻烦。尽管如此，我还是认识了那个年轻的迪克森，他在马特为我装扮了那只刺，现在他在霍尔斯街，普尔弗伊夫人所在的地方。轮子里的轮子。警察的口哨声还在我耳边响起。全部都狼狈不堪。为什么他盯上我了。交给我负责。事情就从这里开始。

—Up the Boers!
——布尔人上来！

—Three cheers for De Wet!
——为 De Wet 欢呼三声！

—We’ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.
——我们要把乔·张伯伦吊在一棵酸苹果树上。

Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The Butter exchange band. Few years’ time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used to. Whether on the scaffold high.
愚蠢的比利犬：一群小崽子大声叫喊。醋山。黄油交换带。几年后，其中一半人成为地方法官和公务员。战争来临：狼狈地参军：同样的家伙过去也是这样。无论是在高高的脚手架上。

Never know who you’re talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms ironing.
永远不知道你在和谁说话。科尼·凯莱赫（Corny Kelleher）眼里有哈维·达夫（Harvey Duff）。就像彼得、丹尼斯或詹姆斯·凯里一样，他们对无敌队发起了攻击。也是社团法人的一员。一直从城堡里收取特勤人员的报酬，怂恿年轻的年轻人了解情况。像烫手山芋一样丢掉他。为什么那些便衣男人总是追求奴隶。轻松地把一个人用来制服。 Square 正在对抗后门。狠狠地打她一下。然后是菜单上的下一件事。正在拜访那里的那位先生是谁？少爷有说什么吗？透过钥匙孔偷窥汤姆。诱饵鸭。热血的年轻学生在她肥胖的手臂上玩耍熨烫。

—Are those yours, Mary?
——那些是你的吗，玛丽？

—I don’t wear such things … Stop or I’ll tell the missus on you. Out half the night.
——我不穿这样的东西……停下来，否则我就告诉你的太太。半夜出来了

—There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.
——美好的时光即将到来，玛丽。等你看到。

—Ah, gelong with your great times coming.
——啊，你的美好时光即将到来。

Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.
酒吧女招待也是如此。烟草店女孩。

James Stephens’ idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that a fellow couldn’t round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey’s daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.
詹姆斯·斯蒂芬斯的想法是最好的。他认识他们。十圈，这样一个人就不能绕比他自己的圈更多的圈。新芬党。出去拿刀。隐藏的手。留在里面，行刑队。特恩基的女儿带他离开了里士满，离开了拉斯克。在他们眼皮底下住在白金汉宫酒店。加里波第。

You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company’s tearoom. Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language question should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here’s a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.
你一定有某种迷恋：帕内尔。阿瑟·格里菲斯（Arthur Griffith）是个头脑简单的人，但他对暴徒无能为力。或者关于我们可爱的土地的气体。火腿和菠菜。都柏林面包店公司的茶室。辩论社团。共和主义是最好的政府形式。语言问题应该优先于经济问题。让你的女儿们把他们骗到你家。让他们吃饱喝足。米迦勒节鹅。这是围裙下面给你准备的一块百里香调味料。在天气变得太冷之前再喝一夸脱鹅油。半饱爱好者。便士卷和与乐队一起散步。雕刻师没有恩典。认为另一个人支付世界上最好的酱汁的想法。让自己完全像在家一样。让我们看看那些杏子，意思是桃子。不远的日子。统治太阳从西北升起。

His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing Trinity’s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.
他的笑容随着他的脚步逐渐消失，一片厚厚的云层慢慢地遮住了太阳，笼罩在三位一体阴郁的正面。电车一辆接一辆地驶过，驶入，驶出，叮当作响。无用的话。事情日复一日地重复着：成群结队的警察出发、返回：电车进进出出。那两个疯子在闲逛。迪格纳姆被带走了。米娜·鲍弗伊 (Mina Purefoy) 肚子肿胀，躺在床上呻吟着，孩子被从她体内拉了出来。每时每刻都有一个人在某个地方诞生。其他人每秒都在死去。因为我喂了鸟五分钟。三百人寿终正寝。另外三百个出生的人，洗掉了血，都被羔羊的血洗掉了，嚎叫着玛啊啊啊。

Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan’s mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter, for the night.
城市的逝去，其他城市的到来，也逝去：其他的到来，逝去。房屋、一排房屋、街道、数英里的人行道、堆积的砖块、石头。换手。这个主人，那个主人。他们说，房东永远不会死。当他收到辞职通知时，其他人就会接替他的位置。他们用黄金买下了这个地方，但他们仍然拥有所有的黄金。在某个地方诈骗。堆积在城市中，年复一年地磨损。沙子里的金字塔。以面包和洋葱为基础。奴隶中国墙。巴比伦。留下了大石头。圆塔。剩下的瓦砾，蔓延的郊区，偷工减料。克万的蘑菇屋是由微风建造的。住所，过夜。

No-one is anything.
没有人是什么。

This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.
这是一天中最糟糕的时刻。活力。沉闷、阴沉：讨厌这个时刻。感觉自己好像被吃掉了然后吐了一样。

Provost’s house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn’t live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.
教务长的房子。尊敬的鲑鱼博士：鲑鱼罐头。里面装得很好。就像太平间教堂一样。如果他们付钱给我，我就不会住在那里。希望他们今天有肝脏和培根。大自然厌恶真空。

The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware opposite in Walter Sexton’s window by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing.
太阳慢慢地升起，在沃尔特·塞克斯顿对面的银器间发出闪烁的光芒，约翰·霍华德·帕内尔从窗户旁经过，没有看见。

There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that’s a coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don’t meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal’s uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a pain. Great man’s brother: his brother’s brother. He’d look nice on the city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That’s the fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright lik surgeon M’Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot’s banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.
他就在那里：兄弟。他的形象。令人难以忘怀的脸。现在这是一个巧合。当然，数百次你会想起一个人，却没有遇见他。就像一个在睡梦中行走的人。没有人认识他。今天一定是公司会议。他们说，自从他上任以来，他就从未穿过过市元帅的制服。查理·卡瓦纳 (Charley Kavanagh) 常常昂首阔步地出现，戴着三角帽，气喘吁吁，扑粉，刮胡子。看看他那忧伤的步伐。吃了坏鸡蛋。偷看鬼的眼睛。我很痛苦。伟人的兄弟：他兄弟的兄弟。他骑在城市充电器上会很帅。投入 D.B.C.可能是为了喝咖啡，在那里下棋。他的兄弟利用男人作为棋子。让他们都去锅里吧。害怕对他发表评论。用他的那只眼睛冻结他们。这就是魅力所在：名字。都有点感动。疯狂范妮和他的另一个妹妹迪金森夫人带着猩红色的安全带到处行驶。像外科医生 M’Ardle 一样将螺栓直立起来。大卫·希伊（David Sheehy）仍然在南米斯（South Meath）击败了他。申请加入奇尔特恩百人计划并退休进入公共生活。爱国者的盛宴。在公园里吃橘子皮。西蒙·迪达勒斯 (Simon Dedalus) 表示，当他们将帕内尔送入议会时，他会从坟墓中复活，并挽着他的手臂走出下议院。

—Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. The tentacles …
——双头章鱼，其中一个头已经忘记了世界末日的到来，而另一个头则带着苏格兰口音。触手……

They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle. Young woman.
他们沿着路边石从布卢姆先生身后走过。胡子和自行车。年轻女子。

And there he is too. Now that’s really a coincidence: second time. Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A. E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She’s taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.
他也在那里。现在这确实是一个巧合：第二次。即将发生的事件给我们留下了阴影。得到了著名诗人吉奥先生的认可。拉塞尔.和他在一起的可能是莉齐·特威格。 A.E.：这是什么意思？也许是缩写。阿尔伯特·爱德华、阿瑟·埃德蒙、阿方索斯·艾伯·艾德·艾斯奎尔。他说什么？带有苏格兰口音的世界尽头。触手：章鱼。一些神秘的东西：象征主义。坚持下去。她把这一切都看在眼里，一言不发。助君子从事文学工作。

His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only weggebobbles and fruit. Don’t eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it’s healthier. Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the tap all night.
他的目光追随着那个身穿朴素布衣、留着胡子、骑着自行车的高大身影，旁边是一位倾听的女人。来自素食主义者。只有weggobbles和水果。不要吃牛排。如果你这么做了，那头牛的眼睛就会永远追随你。他们说这样更健康。虽然风和水。试过了。让你一整天都在奔跑。糟糕得像个臃肿的人。整晚都在做梦。为什么他们给我的东西叫坚果牛排？营养主义者。果食者。让你觉得你正在吃牛臀肉。荒诞。也咸。他们用苏打水做饭。让你整夜坐在水龙头旁。

Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don’t know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.
她的长筒袜在脚踝处松松垮垮。我讨厌这样：太无味了。他们都是那些文学空灵的人。梦幻般的、阴沉的、象征性的。他们是审美家。如果你看到的那种食物能产生像诗意的大脑波一样，我不会感到惊讶。例如，其中一位警察将爱尔兰炖菜汗水浸入衬衫中，你无法从他身上挤出一行诗。甚至不知道什么是诗。必须处于某种心情。

The dreamy cloudy gull
梦幻的云鸥

Waves o’er the waters dull.
水面上的波浪平淡无奇。

He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer’s daughter’s ba and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money too. There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.
他穿过拿骚街角，站在叶茨父子公司的窗前，给望远镜定价。或者我会去老哈里斯家和年轻的辛克莱聊聊吗？很有礼貌的家伙。可能是在他的午餐时间。必须把我那副旧眼镜弄好。戈尔兹镜片六畿尼。德国人到处都是。以简单的条件进行销售以获取贸易。削弱。可能会在铁路失物招领处找到一对。人们在火车和衣帽间留下的东西令人惊讶。他们在想什么？女人也一样。极好的。去年前往恩尼斯时，必须在利默里克交界处领取那位农民女儿的礼物并交给她。还有无人认领的钱。银行屋顶上有一个小手表可以用来测试那些眼镜。

His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can’t see it. If you imagine it’s there you can almost see it. Can’t see it.
他的眼睑垂到虹膜下缘。看不到。如果你想象它就在那里，你几乎就能看到它。看不到。

He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm’s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk. Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.
他转过身来，站在遮阳篷之间，向太阳伸出一臂之遥的右手。想经常尝试一下。是的：完全。他的小指尖遮住了太阳的圆盘。一定是光线交叉的焦点。如果我有一副黑眼镜就好了。有趣的。当我们在西伦巴第街时，有很多关于这些太阳黑子的讨论。从后花园抬头望去。它们真是可怕的爆炸。今年秋季某个时候将会出现日全食。

Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It’s the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be descended from some king’s mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know you’re not to: what’s parallax? Show this gentleman the door.
现在我想起来了，球是在格林威治时间落下的。这是一个时钟，由 Dunsink 的电线驱动。这个月的第一个星期六必须出去。如果我能介绍一下乔利教授或者了解一些关于他家庭的情况就好了。这样做可以做到：男人总是感到被称赞。最意想不到的奉承。贵族以自己是某个国王情妇的后裔而自豪。他的前辈。用抹子将其铺上。手中的帽子穿过土地。不要一进去就脱口而出你知道不该说的话：什么是视差？请这位先生开门。

Ah.
啊。

His hand fell to his side again.
他的手又落到了身侧。

Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.
从来不知道任何事情。浪费时间。气球旋转、交叉、擦肩而过。总是一样的老叮当。气体：然后是固体：然后是世界：然后是寒冷：然后是死壳四处漂流，冰冻的岩石，就像菠萝岩石一样。月亮。一定是新月出来了，她说。我相信有。

He went on by la maison Claire.
他继续往前走，来到克莱尔宅邸。

Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon. She was humming. The young May moon she’s beaming, love. He other side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm’s la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.
等待。满月是我们两周周日的晚上，恰好有一个新月。沿着托尔卡河往下走。对于锦绣月亮来说还不错。她哼着歌。年轻的五月月亮，她在微笑，亲爱的。他是她的另一面。肘部、手臂。他。萤火虫的 LA-AMP 闪闪发光，亲爱的。触碰。手指。询问。回答。是的。

Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.
停止。停止。如果是的话那就是了。必须。

Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.
布卢姆先生呼吸急促，脚步放慢，经过亚当法庭。

With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of Bob Doran’s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge.
他的眼睛注意到这是鲍勃·多兰的瓶子肩膀正午时分的那条街道，这让他松了口气。在他一年一度的弯道上，M Coy 说道。他们喝酒是为了说或做某事或“cherchez la femme”。在库姆与好友和街头妓女一起，然后在这一年剩下的时间里清醒地担任法官。

Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen’s. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies, eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat. Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp that once did starve us all.
是的。也这么觉得。倾斜进入帝国。走了。纯苏打水对他有好处。帕特·金塞拉 (Pat Kinsella) 在惠特布雷德 (Whitbred) 经营女王剧院之前曾在这里拥有竖琴剧院。一个男孩的肉汤。迪昂·布西科 (Dion Boucicault) 戴着一顶狭小的帽子，脸上挂着丰收月般的脸。学校里的三个普尔蒂女仆。时间过得真快，嗯？裙子下露出红色长裤。喝酒的人，一边喝酒，一边大笑，酒气冲着他们的呼吸。更多的力量，帕特。粗红色：酒鬼的乐趣：大笑和烟雾。摘下那顶白帽子。他那双呆滞的眼睛。他现在在哪儿？某处乞讨。曾经让我们所有人挨饿的竖琴。

I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy. Can’t bring back time. Like holding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.
那时我更高兴了。或者是我？还是我现在就是我？我当时二十八岁。她二十三岁。当我们离开朗伯德街西时，情况发生了变化。鲁迪之后再也不会喜欢它了。无法带回时间。就像手里拿着水一样。你愿意回到那时吗？那时才刚刚开始。你会？你这个可怜的小淘气男孩，你在家里不开心吗？想帮我缝纽扣。我必须回答。把它写在图书馆里。

Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints, silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of plumb.
格拉夫顿街上的同性恋和带遮篷的遮阳篷吸引了他的感官。平纹细布印花、丝绸贵妇和贵妇、马具的叮当声、烘烤堤道上低沉的马蹄声。那个穿白丝袜的女人的脚很粗。希望雨水能把它们弄脏在她身上。乡村培育的查培根。所有的牛肉都在脚后跟上。总是让女人的脚显得笨拙。莫莉看上去精神不正常。

He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. La causa è santa! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.
他磨磨蹭蹭地经过布朗·托马斯丝绸店的窗户。丝带层叠。脆弱的中国丝绸。一个倾斜的瓮从它的嘴里涌出大量血色府绸：有光泽的血液。胡格诺派把它带到了这里。 La causa è santa!塔拉塔拉。很棒的合唱。塔里塔拉。必须用雨水冲洗。梅耶贝尔。塔拉：嘭嘭嘭。

Pincushions. I’m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all over the place. Needles in window curtains.
针垫。我很久以来就威胁要买一个。把它们粘得到处都是。窗帘上有针。

He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn’t like it. Women won’t pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.
他微微露出左前臂。刮擦：几乎消失了。无论如何不是今天。必须回去买那个乳液。也许是为了她的生日。六月七月八号。休息近三个月了。那她可能不喜欢。女人不会捡起别针。说它切洛。

Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.
闪闪发光的丝绸，细长黄铜导轨上的衬裙，扁平的丝袜。

Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.
回去也没用。必须是。告诉我一切。

High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim. Wealth of the world.
呼声很高。阳光温暖的丝绸。叮铃挽具。一切都是为了女人，家和房子，丝网，银，来自雅法的辛辣的丰富水果。议程 Netaim。世间财富。

A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.
一种温暖的人类丰润感在他的大脑中沉淀下来。他的大脑屈服了。香水拥抱着他所攻击的一切。他隐隐约约地饥肠辘辘，默默地渴望着爱。

Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.
杜克街。我们到了。必须吃。伯顿.那就感觉好多了。

He turned Combridge’s corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.
他转过康布里奇的街角，仍然被追赶。叮铃铃，马蹄声。身体芬芳，温暖，饱满。一切都被亲吻了，屈服了：在深夏的田野里，在缠结的压草丛中，在公寓的流水走廊里，沿着沙发，吱吱作响的床。

—Jack, love!
——杰克，亲爱的！

—Darling!
-亲爱的！

—Kiss me, Reggy!
——吻我吧，雷吉！

—My boy!
-我的孩子！

—Love!
-爱！

His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See the animals feed.
他心潮澎湃，推开了伯顿餐厅的门。恶臭堵住了他颤抖的呼吸：刺鼻的肉汁，蔬菜泥。看动物进食。

Men, men, men.
男人们，男人们，男人们。

Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an infant’s saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser’s eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don’t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn’t swallow it all however.
坐在吧台边的高脚凳上，帽子向后推，在桌子旁要求更多的免费面包，狼吞虎咽地狼吞虎咽地吃着粗粮，他们的眼睛凸出来，擦着湿漉漉的小胡子。一个面色苍白的年轻人用餐巾擦着他的刀叉和勺子。一组新的微生物。一个男人围着沾满酱汁的婴儿餐巾，把咕噜咕噜的汤铲进喉咙。一个男人往盘子里吐口水：半咀嚼的软骨：牙龈：没有牙齿可以咀嚼。从烤架上切下来的大块肉。螺栓把它搞定。悲伤的助推者的眼睛。咬下来的东西比他能咀嚼的还要多。我是这样的吗？像别人看待我们一样看待我们自己。饥饿的人是愤怒的人。工作牙齿和下巴。不！哦！骨头！校诗中最后一位爱尔兰异教国王科马克在博因河以南的斯莱蒂窒息而死。想知道他在吃什么。某种奔放的东西。圣帕特里克使他皈依了基督教。然而却无法吞下这一切。

—Roast beef and cabbage.
—烤牛肉和卷心菜。

—One stew.
——一锅炖菜。

Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarette smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men’s beery piss, the stale of ferment.
有男人的味道。他的胃口上涨了。斯帕顿木屑、甜甜温暖的香烟烟雾、塞子的臭味、溢出的啤酒、男人的啤酒尿、陈腐的发酵物。

Couldn’t eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.
在这里吃不了一口。伙计们正在磨刀叉，吃掉面前的所有东西，老家伙正在挑选他的土豆。轻微痉挛，饱满，反刍。之前和之后。饭后恩典。看看这张照片，然后再看看那个。用吸湿的面包狼吞虎咽地炖肉汁。把它从盘子里舔掉，伙计！摆脱这个。

He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.
他环视坐在凳子上和桌上的食客，绷紧了鼻翼。

—Two stouts here.
——这里有两杯黑啤酒。

—One corned and cabbage.
——一份玉米和卷心菜。

That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. That’s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.
那家伙把一把卷心菜狠狠地压下去，仿佛这就是他的生命。好击球。让我坐立不安地看看。从他的三只手上吃东西更安全。把它从肢体上撕下来。他的第二天性。出生时嘴里含着一把银刀。我认为这很机智。或没有。银意味着生来富有。带着刀出生。但随后这个暗示就消失了。

An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?
一个不守规矩的服务员收集了粘糊糊、叮当作响的盘子。站在酒吧里的首席法警罗克吹响了酒杯中泡沫状的王冠。好吧：它在他的靴子附近溅起黄色的水。一个用餐者，刀叉直立，手肘撑在桌子上，准备再吃一份，隔着沾满污迹的报纸盯着食品升降机。另一个小伙子嘴里塞满了东西，对他说着什么。富有同情心的倾听者。餐桌谈话。我咀嚼着“thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday”的嗡嗡声。哈？信仰，你有吗？

Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:
布卢姆先生疑惑地将两根手指举到唇边。他的眼神说道：

—Not here. Don’t see him.
-不在这里。别见他。

Out. I hate dirty eaters.
出去。我讨厌吃脏东西的人。

He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne’s. Stopgap. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.
他向后退到门口。在 Davy Byrne's 餐厅享用小吃。权宜之计。让我继续前进。吃了一顿丰盛的早餐。

—Roast and mashed here.
—这里烤并捣碎。

—Pint of stout.
——品脱黑啤酒。

Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.
每个人都为了自己的利益而竭尽全力。咕噜咕噜。蛴螬。咕噜咕噜。太糟糕了。

He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!
他来到空气更清新的地方，然后转身朝格拉夫顿街走去。吃或被吃。杀！杀！

Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother’s son don’t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans’ dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate’s empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton’s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O’Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel table d’hôte she called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you’re chewing. Then who’d wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.
假设公共厨房也许会在未来几年出现。所有人都带着粥和汤米罐小跑下来，等待填满。吞噬街上的东西。约翰·霍华德·帕内尔（John Howard Parnell）的例子，圣三一学院的教务长，每个母亲的儿子都不要谈论你的教务长和圣三一学院的教务长，妇女和儿童，出租车司机，牧师，陆军元帅，大主教。从艾尔斯伯里路、克莱德路、工匠住宅、北都柏林工会，市长大人坐在他的姜饼马车上，老王后坐在浴椅上。我的盘子是空的。在您使用我们的一体式饮水杯之后。就像菲利普·克兰普顿爵士的喷泉一样。用手帕擦掉微生物。下一个小伙子用他的擦了一批新的。奥弗林神父会把他们全都变成野兔。行都一样。一切都是为了第一。孩子们为了锅里的残渣而打架。想要一个凤凰公园那么大的汤锅。用鱼叉将鱼叉和后躯从其中取出。讨厌你周围的人。她称之为“城市武器酒店套餐”。汤汁浓郁，甘甜可口。永远不知道你在咀嚼谁的想法。那么谁来清洗所有的盘子和叉子呢？那时可能都在吃小报。牙齿越来越糟糕。

After all there’s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers’ buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don’t maul them pieces, young one.
毕竟，素食中有很多来自地球的美味大蒜，当然，在意大利风琴研磨机脆洋葱蘑菇松露之后，它会发出臭味。动物也感到痛苦。拔毛并画出家禽。牲畜市场上那些可怜的畜生正在等待着长柄斧劈开他们的头骨。哞。可怜的小腿在颤抖。嗯。惊人的鲍勃。冒泡并发出吱吱声。屠夫的桶里的灯光摇摇晃晃。把那块胸肉交给我们吧。噗。生头和血淋淋的骨头。被剥皮的玻璃眼羊挂在腰上，羊鼻子上粘着血纸，鼻塞在锯末上抽泣。上衣和鞭子出去了。别把他们打成碎片，年轻人。

Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.
他们为衰落提供新鲜血液。血液总是需要的。阴险。舔掉它，冒着热气，浓浓的糖味。饥饿的鬼魂。

Ah, I’m hungry.
啊，我饿了。

He entered Davy Byrne’s. Moral pub. He doesn’t chat. Stands a drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.
他走进了戴维·伯恩家。道德酒吧。他不聊天。时不时地喝一杯。但在闰年，四年一次。帮我兑现过一次支票。

What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?
我现在要吃什么？他抽出了手表。现在让我看看。尚迪加夫？

—Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.
——你好，布鲁姆，大鼻子弗林在他的角落里说道。

—Hello, Flynn.
——你好，弗林。

—How’s things?
——事情怎么样？

—Tiptop … Let me see. I’ll take a glass of burgundy and … let me see.
—Tiptop ……让我看看。我要一杯勃艮第酒，然后……让我想想。

Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree’s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam’s potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow’s digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.
货架上的沙丁鱼。几乎通过观察来品尝它们。三明治？含和他的后裔在那里聚集、繁衍。盆栽肉。没有Plumtree的盆栽肉，家还叫什么家呢？不完整。多么愚蠢的广告啊！他们把它贴在讣告下面。都长成一棵李子树了。迪格纳姆的盆栽肉。食人者会搭配柠檬和米饭。白传教士太咸了。比如腌肉。预计酋长会消耗部分荣誉。运动起来应该会很辛苦吧。他的妻子们排成一排观看效果。有一个真正的皇家老黑鬼。谁吃了麦克特里格牧师的东西或者其他什么东西。有了它，就有了幸福的居所。天知道是什么混合物。发霉的内脏、气管被伪造并切碎。谜题找到肉。犹太洁食。肉和奶不能一起吃。这就是他们现在所说的卫生。赎罪日内部快速春季大扫除。和平与战争取决于某些人的消化。宗教。圣诞节火鸡和鹅。屠杀无辜。吃喝玩乐。然后休闲病房满了之后。头上缠着绷带。奶酪会消化除自身以外的所有物质。米蒂奶酪。

—Have you a cheese sandwich?
——你有奶酪三明治吗？

—Yes, sir.
-是的先生。

Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.
如果他们有的话，也喜欢一些橄榄。我更喜欢意大利语。一杯上好的勃艮第酒就可以带走它。润滑。汤姆·克南 (Tom Kernan) 会做一道美味的沙拉，凉爽如黄瓜。充满热情。纯橄榄油。米莉给我端来了炸肉排和一小枝欧芹。取一个西班牙洋葱。上帝创造食物，魔鬼厨师。魔鬼蟹。

—Wife well?
——妻子身体好吗？

—Quite well, thanks … A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
——很好，谢谢……那么，一份奶酪三明治。戈尔冈朱勒干酪，你有吗？

—Yes, sir.
-是的先生。

Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.
诺西·弗林喝了一口烈酒。

—Doing any singing those times?
——那段时间有唱歌吗？

Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm. Free ad.
看看他的嘴。可以在自己耳边吹口哨。拍打耳朵以匹配。音乐。和我的车夫一样了解它。还是告诉他比较好。没有坏处。免费广告。

—She’s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.
——她已订婚，将于本月底进行一场大型巡演。你也许听说过。

—No. O, that’s the style. Who’s getting it up?
-不。哦，就是这个风格。谁来解决这个问题？

The curate served.
牧师服务。

—How much is that?
-那个多少钱？

—Seven d., sir … Thank you, sir.
——七点，先生……谢谢您，先生。

Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr MacTrigger. Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff. His five hundred wives. Had the time of their lives.
布卢姆先生把他的三明治切成细条。麦克特里格先生。比梦幻般的奶油状的东西更容易。他的五百个妻子。度过了他们一生中最美好的时光。

—Mustard, sir?
——芥末，先生？

—Thank you.
-谢谢。

He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. Their lives. I have it. It grew bigger and bigger and bigger.
他在每一个抬起的条状黄色斑点下面都钉了钉子。他们的生活。我有。它变得越来越大。

—Getting it up? he said. Well, it’s like a company idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.
——起来了吗？他说。嗯，你看，这就像一个公司的想法。部分股份，部分利润。

—Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn’t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?
——哎呀，现在我想起来了，大鼻子弗林说，把手伸进口袋里挠着腹股沟。这是谁告诉我的？布莱兹·博伊兰（Blazes Boylan）不是也参与其中吗？

A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom’s heart. He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.
芥末般的空气热气笼罩着布卢姆先生的心。他抬起眼睛，对上了一只胆汁十足的时钟的目光。二。酒吧的时钟快了五分钟。时间继续。手在动。二。还没有。

His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.
他的腹部渴望向上，沉入体内，渴望得更久，更渴望。

Wine.
葡萄酒。

He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.
他抿了一口甜酒，用力命令喉咙加速，然后小心翼翼地放下酒杯。

—Yes, he said. He’s the organiser in point of fact.
——是的，他说。事实上他是组织者。

No fear: no brains.
没有恐惧：没有大脑。

Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.
诺西·弗林吸了吸鼻子，抓了抓。跳蚤美美地吃一顿。

—He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me …
——杰克·穆尼告诉我，他运气不错，在那场拳击比赛中，迈勒·基奥再次赢得了波托贝洛军营里的那个士兵。天哪，他告诉我，他在卡洛县养了一条小腌鱼……

Hope that dewdrop doesn’t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.
希望露珠不会落入他的玻璃杯中。不，把它咽下去了。

—For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.
——将近一个月了，伙计，在它消失之前。奉上帝之命，吸鸭蛋。让他远离酒，明白吗？哦，上帝啊，布莱兹是个毛茸茸的小伙子。

Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring’s blush. Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat on the parsnips.
戴维·伯恩（Davy Byrne）穿着褶缝衬衫从后栏走出来，餐巾纸擦了两下嘴唇。鲱鱼的脸红。每个特征上的笑容都充满了如此这般的色彩。防风草上的脂肪太多。

—And here’s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?
——这是他自己，给他点胡椒粉，诺西·弗林说。你能为我们提供一个好的金杯赛吗？

—I’m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.
——我不同意了，弗林先生，戴维·伯恩回答道。我从来没有把任何东西放在马身上。

—You’re right there, Nosey Flynn said.
——你就在那里，诺西·弗林说。

Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.
布卢姆先生吃着他的三明治条、新鲜干净的面包，带着恶心的辛辣芥末味和绿色奶酪的脚味。抿了一口酒，他的味觉得到了舒缓。不是原木那。寒冷的天气，味道更饱满。

Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.
不错的安静的酒吧。那个柜台里有一块漂亮的木头。精心策划的。就像它在那里弯曲的方式一样。

—I wouldn’t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined many a man, the same horses.
——我根本不会做这方面的任何事情，戴维·伯恩说。它毁掉了许多人，同样的马。

Vintners’ sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.
葡萄酒商的抽奖活动。获得在该场所销售啤酒、葡萄酒和烈酒的许可。正面我赢，反面你输。

—True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you’re in the know. There’s no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He’s giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel’s the favourite, lord Howard de Walden’s, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.
——对你来说确实如此，大鼻子弗林说。除非你知道。现在没有直接的运动。莱内汉得到了一些好东西。他今天要赠送权杖。仙粉黛 (Zinfandel) 最受欢迎，霍华德·德瓦尔登 (Howard de Walden) 勋爵的在埃普索姆 (Epsom) 获胜。莫尼·坎农骑在他身上。两周前我本可以与圣阿曼特打成七比一的。

—That so? Davy Byrne said …
-这么？戴维·伯恩说……

He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.
他走到窗前，拿起那本零用现金簿，浏览了一遍。

—I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild’s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O’Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.
——我可以，相信，大鼻子弗林吸着鼻子说道。那是一块罕见的马肉。圣弗鲁斯坎是她的父亲。她在一场雷雨中获胜，罗斯柴尔德的母马，耳朵里塞着棉絮。蓝色夹克和黄色帽子。大本·多拉德和他的约翰·奥冈特运气不好。他让我放弃了。哎呀。

He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.
他顺从地从玻璃杯里喝了一口，手指顺着笛子滑过。

—Ay, he said, sighing.
——唉，他叹了口气说道。

Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he’d have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like. Dogs’ cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach’s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!
布卢姆先生气喘吁吁地站着，看着他的叹息。爱管闲事的麻木头骨。我会告诉他那匹马莱内汉吗？他已经知道了。最好让他忘记。去吧，失去更多。傻瓜和他的钱。露珠又落了下来。他的鼻子冰冷，他会亲吻一个女人。不过他们可能会喜欢。他们喜欢带刺的胡须。狗的鼻子冰凉。老赖尔丹夫人和城市阿姆斯酒店里肚子咕咕叫的斯凯梗犬。莫莉在她的腿上抚摸着他。哦，大狗bowwowsywowsy！

Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I’m not thirsty. Bath of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o’clock I can. Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She …
葡萄酒浸泡并软化了面包芥末的髓，再加上令人伤感的奶酪。这是好酒。尝尝更好，因为我不渴。巴斯当然会这么做。只要咬一两口就可以了。然后大约六点钟我就可以了。六。六。那时时间就会消失。她 …

Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters’ claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn’t know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The élite. Crème de la crème. They want special dishes to pretend they’re. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls’ kitchen area. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage à la duchesse de Parme. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you’ve eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards’ desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn’t mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. Du, de la French. Still it’s the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes’ gills can’t write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.
酒的微火点燃了他的血管。我非常想要那样。感觉颜色很差。他的眼睛不饥饿地看到了架子上的罐头：沙丁鱼，华丽的龙虾爪。人们捡起所有奇怪的东西作为食物。从贝壳中取出，长春花用别针取出，从树上取出，从地里取出的蜗牛被法国人吃，用钩子上的诱饵从海中取出。愚蠢的鱼一千年什么也学不到。如果您不知道将任何东西放入口中是有风险的。有毒浆果。约翰尼·马格里斯.你认为圆度好。艳丽的颜色会警告你远离。一个人告诉另一个人，等等。先在狗身上试试。由气味或外观引导。诱人的水果。冰锥。奶油。直觉。以橙树林为例。需要人工灌溉。布雷布特鲁大街。是的，但是牡蛎呢？像痰一样难看。肮脏的贝壳。魔鬼也打开它们。谁发现了他们？他们以垃圾、污水为食。嘶嘶声和红岸牡蛎。对性的影响。阿芙罗狄丝。今天早上他在红岸。他是餐桌上的牡蛎老鱼还是床上的年轻肉没有六月没有牡蛎。但也有人喜欢高的东西。被污染的游戏。锯齿野兔。首先抓住你的兔子。中国人吃鸡蛋五十年，又蓝又绿。晚餐三十道菜。每道菜无害，可能会混合在里面。毒药之谜的想法。利奥波德大公是不是，是，还是奥托是哈布斯堡王朝的一员？或者是谁用自己的头颈来吃掉的？城里最便宜的午餐。当然是贵族，那么其他人就效仿来赶时髦。米莉也摇滚油和面粉。生糕点我自己喜欢。他们将一半捕获的牡蛎扔回海里以维持价格。便宜了没人买。鱼子酱。做盛大的事。戴着绿色眼镜的飞节。膨胀井喷。这位女士。粉胸珍珠。精英。 奶油中的奶油。他们想要一些特别的菜肴来假装自己是这样的。隐士用一盘脉冲来抑制肉体的刺痛。认识我就来和我一起吃饭吧。皇家鲟鱼高级警长、屠夫科菲有权从他的前任那里获得森林里的鹿肉。送他半头牛回来。我在劳斯莱斯大师的厨房区域看到了摊铺。像拉比一样的白帽厨师。可燃鸭子。帕尔马公爵夫人的卷心菜。最好将其写在菜单上，这样您就可以知道自己吃了什么。太多的药物会破坏肉汤。我自己也知道。与爱德华兹的干汤一起服用。鹅给他们塞得很傻。龙虾是活煮的。一定要吃一些松鸡。不介意在豪华酒店当服务员。小贴士，晚礼服，半裸的女士。杜贝达小姐，我可以诱惑你再吃一点柠檬片吗？是的，做bedad。她也这么做了。我期望胡格诺派的名字。我记得基利尼住着一位杜贝达小姐。杜，法国人。仍然是同一条鱼，也许摩尔街的老米基·汉伦（Micky Hanlon）把赚钱的胆子掏出来了，把手放在鱼鳃里，无法在支票上写下自己的名字，以为他是在用扭曲的嘴画风景。 Moooikill A Aitcha Ha 像一群布洛克鞋一样无知，价值五万英镑。

Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.
窗玻璃上粘着两只苍蝇，嗡嗡作响。

Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun’s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple by the Lion’s head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you’ll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman’s breasts full in her blouse of nun’s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.
灼热的酒香在他的口腔里久久难以咽下。在勃艮第的压榨葡萄中压榨葡萄。这是太阳的热量。似乎有一种秘密的触感在诉说着我的记忆。触动了他的感觉，湿润了回忆。隐藏在我们下面海湾霍斯的野生蕨类植物下睡觉：天空。没有声音。天空。狮子头旁的海湾呈紫色。德拉姆莱克的绿色。黄绿前往萨顿。海底的田野，草丛中淡淡的棕色线条，埋藏着的城市。她的头发枕在我的外套上，石南丛中的蠼螋在她的后颈下擦洗我的手，你会把我都扔掉的。噢，真奇怪！她的手涂着药膏，抚摸着我，爱抚着我；她看着我的眼睛没有移开。我对她着迷，躺在那里，双唇张开，吻了她的嘴。嗯。她轻轻地把温热的籽饼放进我嘴里咀嚼。她的嘴里含糊不清地咕哝着甜甜的唾沫。喜悦：我吃了它：喜悦。年轻的生命，她的嘴唇让我撅起嘴。柔软温暖的粘胶果冻嘴唇。她的眼睛是鲜花，带我走，愿意的眼睛。鹅卵石落下。她静静地躺着。一只山羊。没有人。一只保姆山羊在本霍斯杜鹃花丛中稳健地行走，掉落着葡萄干。在蕨类植物的遮蔽下，她暖暖地笑了。我疯狂地躺在她身上，亲吻她：眼睛，她的嘴唇，她伸长的脖子，她的乳房在修女的面纱罩衫下丰满，肥胖的乳头直立。我热辣辣地舌头舔着她。她吻了我。我被吻了。她完全屈服了，甩动了我的头发。吻了，她吻了我。

Me. And me now.
我。现在还有我。

Stuck, the flies buzzed.
卡住了，苍蝇嗡嗡地响。

His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don’t care what man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods’ food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I’ll look today. Keeper won’t see. Bend down let something drop see if she.
他低垂的目光追随着橡木板无声的纹理。美：它的曲线：曲线就是美。身材匀称的女神，维纳斯、朱诺：世人钦佩的曲线。可以看到她们在图书馆博物馆的圆形大厅里站立着，裸体的女神们。帮助消化。他们不在乎男人的外表。都来看看吧。从不说话。我的意思是对像弗林这样的人说。假设她演《皮格马利翁》和《加拉泰亚》，她首先会说什么？凡人！把你放在合适的位置。畅饮花蜜，享用神明的金盘，一切都令人垂涎欲滴。不像我们吃的制革午餐，煮羊肉、胡萝卜和芜菁，还有一瓶奥尔索普啤酒。花蜜想象它喝电：神的食物。朱诺尼安塑造了美丽的女性形象。可爱不朽。我们把食物塞进一个洞里，然后从后面塞进去：食物、乳糜、血液、粪便、泥土、食物：必须像给发动机加油一样喂它。他们没有。从来没有看过。我今天就看看。守门员不会看到。弯下腰让东西掉下来看看她是否。

Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.
运球时一条安静的信息从他的膀胱里传来，该做的事不该做的事还有该做的事。一个男人，准备好了，他把酒杯里的酒糟喝干，然后走过去，他们也把自己奉献给了男人，有男子气概，和男人的情人躺在一起，一个年轻人喜欢她，走到院子里。

When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
当他的靴子声停止时，戴维·伯恩在他的书中说道：

—What is this he is? Isn’t he in the insurance line?
——他到底是什么？他不是在保险行吗？

—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the Freeman.
——他很久以前就不再这样了，诺西·弗林说。他为弗里曼拉票。

—I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?
——我很熟悉他，戴维·伯恩说。他有麻烦吗？

—Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?
-麻烦？诺西·弗林说道。我没听说过。为什么？

—I noticed he was in mourning.
——我注意到他正在哀悼。

—Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at home. You’re right, by God. So he was.
-是他？诺西·弗林说道。他就是这样，信仰。我问他在家过得怎么样。你是对的，上帝啊。他确实如此。

—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.
——戴维·伯恩仁慈地说，如果我看到一位绅士遇到这样的麻烦，我绝不会提起这个话题。它只会在他们的脑海中带来新鲜感。

—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She’s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.
——无论如何，这不是妻子，诺西·弗林说。前天我遇见了他，他从约翰·怀斯·诺兰的妻子在亨利街拥有的爱尔兰农场奶牛场出来，手里拿着一罐奶油，准备带回家给他的另一半。我告诉你，她营养良好。烤面包上的鸻。

—And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.
——他是在为自由人做事吗？戴维·伯恩说道。

Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.
诺西·弗林抿起嘴唇。

—-He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that.
——他不会在他看到的广告上买奶油。你可以用它来做培根。

—How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
-为何如此？戴维·伯恩从他的书中问道。

Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.
诺西·弗林用杂耍的手指在空中快速传球。他眨了眨眼睛。

—He’s in the craft, he said.
——他在这方面，他说。

—-Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
——你是这么告诉我的吗？戴维·伯恩说道。

—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He’s an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.
——非常如此，诺西·弗林说。古代自由和公认的秩序。他是一个优秀的兄弟。光、生命和爱，来自上帝。他们为他提供了帮助。这是由一个——好吧，我不会说是谁告诉我的。

—Is that a fact?
——这是事实吗？

—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you’re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they’re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
——哦，这是一个很好的命令，诺西·弗林说。当你情绪低落时，他们会坚持你。我知道有一个人正试图参与其中。但他们已经非常接近了。天哪，他们把女性排除在外是对的。

Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
戴维·伯恩笑着打哈欠地点点头：

—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
——啊啊啊啊啊！

—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.
——诺西·弗林说，有一个女人把自己藏在钟表里，想知道他们在做什么。但该死的，他们还是闻出了她的气味，并当场宣誓她成为石匠大师。那是多纳莱尔的圣莱格斯之一。

Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
戴维·伯恩打了个哈欠，吃饱了，眼含泪水地说：

—And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.
——这是事实吗？他是一个正派安静的人。我经常在这里看到他，但我从来没有见过他——你知道，是在电话那头。

—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn’t you see him look at his watch? Ah, you weren’t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.
——全能的上帝不可能让他喝醉，大鼻子弗林坚定地说。当乐趣变得太激烈时就会滑落。你没看见他看手表吗？啊，你不在场。如果你让他喝一杯，他做的第一件事就是拿着手表看看他应该喝什么。向上帝宣告他确实如此。

—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He’s a safe man, I’d say.
——有一些是这样的，戴维·伯恩说。我想说，他是一个安全的人。

—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He’s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there’s one thing he’ll never do.
——他还不错，大鼻子弗林说，吸了一口气。众所周知，他也会放下手来帮助别人。给魔鬼应得的。哦，布鲁姆有他的优点。但有一件事他永远不会做。

His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
他的手在烈酒旁边潦草地写下了一个干燥的钢笔签名。

—I know, Davy Byrne said.
——我知道，戴维·伯恩说。

—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
——没有什么是白纸黑字的，大鼻子弗林说。

Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
帕迪·伦纳德和班塔姆·莱昂斯进来了。汤姆·罗奇福德皱着眉头跟在后面，一只手放在他的紫红色背心上。

—Day, Mr Byrne.
——戴，伯恩先生。

—Day, gentlemen.
——白天，先生们。

They paused at the counter.
他们在柜台前停了下来。

—Who’s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.
——谁站着？帕迪·伦纳德问道。

—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
——反正我坐着，大鼻子弗林回答。

—Well, what’ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.
——嗯，会是什么？帕迪·伦纳德问道。

—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
——我要一块石姜，班塔姆·莱昂斯说。

—How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God’ sake? What’s yours, Tom?
-多少？帕迪·伦纳德哭了。从什么时候开始，看在上帝的份上？汤姆，你的是什么？

—How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
——主要排水情况如何？诺西·弗林喝了一口酒问道。

For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.
汤姆·罗奇福德将手按在胸骨上，打了个嗝作为回答。

—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
——拜恩先生，麻烦您给我一杯淡水好吗？他说。

—Certainly, sir.
-当然，先生。

Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
帕迪·伦纳德看着他的同学。

—Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.
——上帝爱一只鸭子，他说。看看我站着喝什么！冷水和姜汁汽水！两个家伙会从酸痛的腿上喝威士忌。他已经为金杯赛做好了准备。一个死的剪断。

—Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
——是仙粉黛吗？诺西·弗林问道。

Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.
汤姆·罗奇福德把一张扭曲的纸上的粉末洒到了他面前的水中。

—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
——那该死的消化不良，他在喝酒前说道。

—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
——面包汽水非常好，戴维·伯恩说。

Tom Rochford nodded and drank.
汤姆·罗奇福德点点头，喝了一口酒。

—Is it Zinfandel?
——是仙粉黛吗？

—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I’m going to plunge five bob on my own.
-没说什么！班塔姆·里昂眨了眨眼。我要自己跳五鲍勃。

—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?
——告诉我们你是否值得你的盐，让你受诅咒吧，帕迪·伦纳德说。谁给你的？

Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
布鲁姆先生出去时举起三个手指打招呼。

—So long! Nosey Flynn said.
-这么久！诺西·弗林说道。

The others turned.
其他人转过身来。

—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
——现在就是这个人把它给了我，班塔姆·里昂低声说道。

—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a …
——呃呃！帕迪·伦纳德轻蔑地说道。伯恩先生，先生，之后我们会带上您的两个小詹姆森，还有一个……

—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
——石姜，戴维·伯恩礼貌地补充道。

—Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.
——嗯，帕迪·伦纳德说。给宝宝用的吸奶瓶。

Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.
布卢姆先生朝道森街走去，用舌头舔着牙齿。一定是绿色的东西：比如菠菜。然后用伦琴射线探照灯就可以了。

At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.
在杜克巷，一只贪婪的梗犬在鹅卵石上用指关节反刍，用新的热情舔食它。过量。充分消化内容后满怀谢意地返回。先甜后咸。布卢姆先生小心翼翼地滑行。反刍动物。他的第二道菜。他们的上颌移动。想知道汤姆·罗奇福德是否会用他的这项发明做点什么？浪费时间向弗林的嘴解释。瘦人嘴长。应该是一个大厅或者一个发明家可以进去自由发明的地方。当然，那么所有的怪人都会纠缠你。

He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
他哼了一声，延长了铁栅门的关闭声，庄严地回响着：

Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
唐璜，塞纳尔特科

M’invitasti.
M'invitasti。

Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in the blues. Dutch courage. That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must.
感觉好多了。勃艮第。很好接我。谁先蒸馏的？一些忧郁的家伙。荷兰人的勇气。国家图书馆里的基尔肯尼人现在我必须去。

Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.
水管工威廉米勒的窗户里光秃秃的干净马桶等待着他，这让他回想起了自己的想法。他们可以：一路观察下去，吞下一根针，有时会在多年后从肋骨中出来，环游身体，改变胆管，脾脏，喷出肝脏，胃液，像管道一样的肠管。但可怜的缓冲者必须一直站着，让他的内脏暴露出来。科学。

—A cenar teco.
——塞纳尔特科。

What does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.
那个teco是什么意思？也许今晚。

Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
唐璜，你邀请我了

To come to supper tonight,
今晚来吃晚饭，

The rum the rumdum.
朗姆酒朗姆酒。

Doesn’t go properly.
进展不顺利。

Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That’ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott’s dyeworks van over there. If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig’s back.
凯斯：如果我让南内蒂来的话，两个月。那将是两磅十大约两磅八。三个海因斯欠我的。两点十一点。普雷斯科特的染厂车就在那边。如果我收到比利·普雷斯科特的广告：两点十五分。大约五几尼。在猪背上。

Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.
可以给莫莉买一件丝绸衬裙，和她新吊袜带的颜色一样。

Today. Today. Not think.
今天。今天。不认为。

Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton, Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls. Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages. Will eat anything.
那就南巡吧。英国的饮水场怎么样？布莱顿、马盖特。月光下的码头。她的声音飘了出来。那些可爱的海边女孩。约翰·朗的对面，一个正在打瞌睡的游手好闲者懒洋洋地躺着，啃着结痂的指关节，陷入沉思。勤劳的人想要工作。工资微薄。什么都会吃。

Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore. Why I left the church of Rome? Birds’ Nest. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.
布卢姆先生转向格雷糖果店的橱窗，里面摆满了未买的馅饼，经过了牧师托马斯·康尼兰的书店。我为什么离开罗马教会？鸟巢。女人管理着他。他们说，在马铃薯枯萎病发生的时候，他们常常给贫困儿童喝汤，让他们改喝新教徒的汤。社会关于爸爸为可怜的犹太人皈依而去的方式。同样的诱饵。为什么我们离开罗马教堂。

A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.
一个失明的小伙子站在那儿，用细长的手杖敲着路边石。看不见电车。想要穿越。

—Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
——你想穿越吗？布鲁姆先生问道。

The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.
盲目的小伙子没有回答。他的墙脸微弱地皱起眉头。他不确定地摇摇头。

—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There’s nothing in the way.
——你在道森街，布卢姆先生说。莫尔斯沃思街就在对面。你想穿越吗？没有任何障碍。

The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s. Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long’s. Slaking his drouth.
手杖颤抖着向左移了出去。布卢姆先生的目光顺着这条线看去，再次看到染料厂的货车停在德拉戈的货车前面。当我在的时候，我看到了他闪亮的头发。马下垂。约翰·朗的司机。缓解他的口渴。

—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving. I’ll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
——那里有一辆货车，布卢姆先生说，但它没有动。我会看到你。您想去莫尔斯沃思街吗？

—Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.
——是的，小伙子回答道。南弗雷德里克街。

—Come, Mr Bloom said.
——来吧，布卢姆先生说。

He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.
他轻轻碰触那瘦弱的手肘，然后握住那只软弱无力的手，引导它前进。

Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust what you tell them. Pass a common remark.
跟他说点什么吧。最好不要做居高临下的事情。他们不相信你告诉他们的话。通过一个共同的评论。

—The rain kept off.
——雨停了。

No answer.
没有答案。

Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child’s hand, his hand. Like Milly’s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired drudge get his doze. That’s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.
他的外套上有污渍。我想，他会流口水。对他来说，味道完全不同。必须先用勺子喂。就像孩子的手，他的手。就像米莉的一样。敏感的。我敢说是从我的手上打量着我。想知道他有没有名字。范.让手杖远离马腿：疲惫的苦役可以打瞌睡。这是正确的。清除。牛后：马前。

—Thanks, sir.
-谢谢先生。

Knows I’m a man. Voice.
知道我是个男人。嗓音。

—Right now? First turn to the left.
-现在？首先向左转。

The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.
失明的小伙子敲了敲路边石，继续上路，收回手杖，再次摸索起来。

Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.
布卢姆先生走在无眼的脚后面，穿着一套平剪的人字花呢套装。可怜的年轻人！他到底是怎么知道货车在那儿的？一定感受到了。也许可以看到他们额头上的东西：一种体积感。它的重量或大小，比黑暗更黑的东西。不知道如果有什么东西被移除他会感觉到吗？感觉有差距。他对都柏林一定有一种奇怪的想法，他在石头上敲着路。如果没有那根拐杖，他能直线行走吗？虔诚的脸上没有血色，就像一个即将成为牧师的人。

Penrose! That was that chap’s name.
彭罗斯！那是那个家伙的名字。

Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
看看他们可以学习做的所有事情。用手指阅读。给钢琴调音。或者我们很惊讶他们有脑子。为什么如果一个畸形的人或驼背的人说出了我们可能会说的话，我们就会认为他很聪明。当然其他感官更多。绣。辫子篮子。人们应该提供帮助。我可以为莫莉的生日买一个工作篮。讨厌缝纫。可能会提出异议。他们称他们为“黑暗人”。

Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.
嗅觉也一定更强。气味四面八方，聚集在一起。每条街都有不同的气味。各人亦然。然后是春天、夏天：气味。口味？他们说闭上眼睛或头脑感冒时无法品尝葡萄酒。他们还说在黑暗中吸烟没有任何乐趣。

And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind’s eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.
比如说，和一个女人。不见更无耻。那个女孩经过斯图尔特机构，头朝空中。看着我。我都戴上了。没有见到她一定很奇怪。这是他心目中的一种形式。声音、温度：当他用手指触摸她时，几乎必须看到线条、曲线。例如，他的手放在她的头发上。比如说，说它是黑色的。好的。我们称之为黑色。然后掠过她雪白的肌肤。或许感觉不一样。白色的感觉。

Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer’s just here too. Wait. Think over it.
邮局。必须回答。今天是基佬。给她寄一张两先令半克朗的邮政汇票。收下我的小礼物吧。文具店也在这里。等待。想一想。

With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.
他用温柔的手指感觉到头发慢慢地向后梳到耳朵上方。再次。细细稻草的纤维。然后手指轻轻触碰右脸颊的皮肤。那里的头发也很柔软。不够流畅。肚子是最光滑的。无人问津。他在那里走进弗雷德里克街。也许是莱文斯顿舞蹈学院的钢琴。可能是在安顿我的牙套。

Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly. But I know it’s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to see.
路过多兰的酒馆时，他把手伸进背心和裤子之间，轻轻地拉开衬衫，感觉到腹部松弛的褶皱。但我知道它是白黄色的。想尝试在黑暗中看看。

He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
他收回手，拉起裙子。

Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses. Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to them someway.
可怜的家伙！真是个男孩啊。糟糕的。真的很可怕。如果他看不见，他还会有什么梦想呢？生活对他来说就是一个梦想。这样诞生的正义在哪里？所有那些参加豆宴的妇女和儿童都在纽约被烧毁和淹死。大屠杀。他们称之为业力轮回，因为你在前世所犯下的罪孽，转世遇到了他。亲爱的，亲爱的，亲爱的。当然，遗憾的是：但不知何故，你无法以某种方式理解它们。

Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall. Solemn as Troy. After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he’d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court. Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J. a great strawcalling. Now he’s really what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
弗雷德里克·福尔金纳爵士走进共济会大厅。庄严如特洛伊。在厄尔斯福特露台享用丰盛的午餐后。老法律亲信破解大瓶。法官席和巡回法庭的故事以及蓝衣学校的编年史。我判了他十年。我想他会对我喝的东西嗤之以鼻。为他们准备的年份葡萄酒，在布满灰尘的瓶子上标有年份。对记录法庭的正义有自己的看法。好心的老头。警方的指控表上写满了案件，列出了制造犯罪的百分比。将他们发送到正确的位置。放债人的恶魔。给了鲁本·J.一个很大的稻草。现在他真的是他们所说的肮脏的犹太人。法官拥有的权力。戴着假发的硬皮旧礼帽。熊爪子酸痛。愿主怜悯你的灵魂。

Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant. Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital. The Messiah was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.
你好，标语牌。米鲁斯集市。中尉阁下。第十六。今天是这样。为美世医院提供资金援助。弥赛亚最初就是为此而被赐予的。是的。亨德尔。去那里怎么样：Ballsbridge。顺便拜访一下凯斯。像水蛭一样粘在他身上是没有用的。耗尽我的欢迎。肯定认识门口的一个人。

Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.
布卢姆先生来到基尔代尔街。首先我必须。图书馆。

Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.
阳光下的草帽。棕褐色的鞋子。翻边长裤。这是。这是。

His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.
他的心轻轻地跳动着。向右。博物馆。女神们。他向右转向。

Is it? Almost certain. Won’t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.
是吗？几乎确定。不会看。酒洒在我脸上。我为什么这么做？太令人头疼了。是的。步行。不看。进行。

Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes. Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?
他抬起眼睛，迈着长长的、带风的步伐走向博物馆大门。漂亮的建筑。托马斯·迪恩爵士设计。不关注我吗？

Didn’t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.
也许没有看到我。他的眼睛里有光。

The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.
他的呼吸急促地发出短促的叹息。快的。冰冷的雕像：那里安静。一分钟就安全了

No. Didn’t see me. After two. Just at the gate.
没有，没有看到我。两点之后。就在门口。

My heart!
我的心！

His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.
他的眼睛不停地跳动，坚定地注视着奶油色曲线的石头。托马斯·迪恩爵士是希腊建筑大师。

Look for something I.
找点东西我。

His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I?
他的手迅速伸进口袋，拿出来，读着展开的《内塔伊姆议程》。我在哪里？

Busy looking.
忙着找。

He thrust back quick Agendath.
他迅速推回阿根达斯。

Afternoon she said.
她说，下午。

I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. Freeman. Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?
我正在寻找那个。对，就那个。尝试所有口袋。汉克。弗里曼。我在哪里？是啊。裤子。土豆。钱包。在哪里？

Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.
匆忙。静静地走。更多时刻。我的心。

His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.
他伸手寻找我放在哪里的东西，在他的臀部口袋里发现了肥皂乳液，不得不叫不温不火的纸粘住。啊肥皂，我是的。门。

Safe!
安全的！

Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
为了安慰他们，贵格会的图书管理员彬彬有礼地低声说道：

—And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of Wilhelm Meister. A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.
——我们有，不是吗，威廉·梅斯特那些无价的书页。一位伟大的诗人对一位伟大的诗人兄弟。正如现实生活中所见，一个犹豫不决的灵魂拿起武器对抗一大堆麻烦，被相互矛盾的疑虑所撕裂。

He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.
他踩着嘎吱作响的整齐皮革向前迈出了一步，又在庄严的地板上向后退了一步。

A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.
一个无声的服务员打开了门，但轻轻地向他无声地招了招手。

—Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.
——直接说，他吱吱作响地要走，尽管犹豫不决。美丽而无能的梦想家，因残酷的事实而悲痛欲绝。总感觉歌德的判断是那么的正确。在更大的分析中确实如此。

Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was gone.
他叽叽喳喳地分析着。秃头，在门口最热心的他用他的大耳朵听服务员的话：听到了他们的声音：然后就走了。

Two left.
还剩下两个。

—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.
——德拉帕利斯先生，史蒂芬冷笑道，他死前十五分钟还活着。

—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder’s gall, to write Paradise Lost at your dictation? The Sorrows of Satan he calls it.
——你找到那六位勇敢的医生了吗？约翰·埃格林顿长老厚颜无耻地问道，按照你的口述写下《失乐园》？他称之为撒旦的悲伤。

Smile. Smile Cranly’s smile.
微笑。微笑克兰利的微笑。

First he tickled her
首先他给她挠痒痒

Then he patted her
然后他拍了拍她

Then he passed the female catheter.
然后他通过了女性导尿管。

For he was a medical
因为他是一名医生

Jolly old medi …
快乐的老医学……

—I feel you would need one more for Hamlet. Seven is dear to the mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.
——我觉得你还需要一部《哈姆雷特》。七对于神秘的心灵来说是珍贵的。闪耀七人 W.B.打电话给他们。

Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.
他红褐色的头骨闪闪发光，靠近他的绿色台灯，在深绿色的阴影中寻找着那张留着胡须的脸，一个奥拉夫，双眼神圣。他低声笑起来：三位一体的西扎尔的笑声：没有得到回应。

Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
管弦乐撒旦，多次哭泣

Tears such as angels weep.
眼泪如天使般哭泣。

Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.
Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta。

He holds my follies hostage.
他把我的愚蠢作为人质。

Cranly’s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one more to hail him: ave, rabbi: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul’s youth I gave him, night by night. God speed. Good hunting.
克兰利的十一个真正的威克洛人解放了他们的祖国。裂牙的凯瑟琳，她的四片美丽的绿色田野，她家里的陌生人。还有一个向他致敬： ave，拉比：蒂纳赫利十二人。在峡谷的阴影下，他为他们发出咕咕声。我一夜又一夜地把我灵魂的青春给了他。神速。狩猎好。

Mulligan has my telegram.
马里根有我的电报。

Folly. Persist.
蠢事。坚持。

—Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.
——约翰·埃格林顿谴责说，我们年轻的爱尔兰吟游诗人还没有创造出一个可以与撒克逊莎士比亚的哈姆雷特并列的人物，尽管我像老本一样崇拜他，但在偶像崇拜方面。

—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.
——所有这些问题都纯粹是学术性的，罗素在他的阴影下神谕道。我的意思是，无论哈姆雷特是莎士比亚、詹姆斯一世还是埃塞克斯。牧师对耶稣历史性的讨论。艺术必须向我们揭示思想、无形的精神本质。关于一件艺术作品的最高问题在于它蕴含的生命有多深。古斯塔夫·莫罗的画是思想的画。雪莱最深刻的诗歌，哈姆雷特的话语，让我们的心灵接触到永恒的智慧，柏拉图的思想世界。剩下的都是男生对男生的猜测。

A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!
A.E. 一直在告诉一些洋基队的采访者。墙，塔塔尼亚袭击了我！

—The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.
——学生首先是学生，史蒂芬超级礼貌地说。亚里士多德曾经是柏拉图的学生。

—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
——人们希望如此，约翰·埃格林顿平静地说。人们可以看到他是一名模范男生，腋下夹着毕业证书。

He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.
他再次对着那张满脸笑容的胡须笑了起来。

Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.
无形的精神。父亲、圣言和神圣的呼吸。天父，天上人。希索斯·克里斯托斯（Hiesos Kristos），美丽的魔术师，每时每刻都在我们身上受苦的理则。这确实是这样。我是祭坛上的火。我是牺牲黄油。

Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H.P.B.’s elemental.
邓洛普（Dunlop），法官，他们中最高贵的罗马人，A.E.，阿瓦尔（Arval），不可言喻的名字，在天堂的高处：K.H.，他们的主人，他的身份对行家来说并不是秘密。大白小屋的兄弟们总是在注视着，看看是否能提供帮助。基督与新娘、光的滋润、由有灵魂的处女、悔改的索菲亚所生，离开到佛陀的境界。生命奥义不适合普通人。 O.P. 必须首先消除恶业。库珀·奥克利夫人曾经瞥见了我们杰出的姐姐 H.P.B. 的元素。

O, fie! Out on’t! Pfuiteufel! You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.
哦，呸！出去吧！普菲特菲尔！你不应该看，夫人，所以当一位女士展示她的元素时，你也不应该看。

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.
贝斯特先生进来了，他高大、年轻、温和、轻盈。他手里优雅地拿着一本笔记本，新的、大的、干净的、明亮的。

—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.
——史蒂芬说，那个模范男生会发现哈姆雷特对他王子灵魂来世的沉思，那不可思议的、微不足道的、平淡无奇的独白，和柏拉图的一样浅薄。

John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
约翰·埃格林顿皱着眉头，怒气冲冲地说：

—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.
——据我所知，听到有人将亚里士多德与柏拉图进行比较，我感到热血沸腾。

—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?
——史蒂芬问道，这两个人中的哪一个会把我逐出他的联邦？

Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.
拔出你的匕首定义。马性是所有马的本质。他们崇拜趋势之流和永恒之流。上帝：街上的噪音：非常逍遥。太空：你一定要看的东西。它们穿过比人类血液的红色小球还小的空间，在布莱克的臀部后面令人毛骨悚然地爬行，进入永恒，而这个植物世界只是其中的一个影子。抓住现在，抓住这里，所有的未来都会陷入过去。

Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.
贝斯特先生走到他的同事面前，态度和蔼可亲。

—Haines is gone, he said.
——海恩斯走了，他说。

—Is he?
-是他？

—I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t you know, about Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht. I couldn’t bring him in to hear the discussion. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.
——我正在给他看朱班维尔的书。你知道吗，他对海德的《康诺特情歌》非常感兴趣。我无法带他进来听讨论。他去吉尔那里买了。

Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
我的小册子，快点把你束缚起来

To greet the callous public.
向冷酷无情的公众致意。

Writ, I ween, ‘twas not my wish
我想说，这不是我的愿望

In lean unlovely English.
用瘦弱的、不可爱的英语。

—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.
——约翰·埃格林顿认为，泥煤烟快要冲昏了他的头脑。

We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.
我们感觉自己身处英格兰。忏悔的小偷。走了。我抽了他的烟。绿色闪烁的石头。镶嵌在海洋环中的祖母绿。

—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phaeacians.
——人们不知道情歌有多么危险，罗素的金蛋神秘地警告道。世界革命的运动源于山坡上农民心中的梦想和愿景。对他们来说，地球不是一块可开发的土地，而是活着的母亲。学院和竞技场的稀薄空气造就了六先令的小说和音乐厅的歌曲。法国在马拉美孕育出最美丽的腐败之花，但理想的生活只向内心贫穷的人展现，即荷马笔下的斐阿克人的生活。

From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
听完这些话，贝斯特先生对斯蒂芬露出了一副不带冒犯的表情。

—Mallarme, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about Hamlet. He says: il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même, don’t you know, reading the book of himself. He describes Hamlet given in a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.
——马拉美，你不知道吗，他说，他写了那些精彩的散文诗，斯蒂芬·麦肯纳过去常常在巴黎读给我听。一部关于哈姆雷特的。他说：il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même，你不知道吗，正在读他自己的书。他描述了哈姆雷特在一个法国小镇上的故事，你知道吗，一个省级小镇。他们做了广告。

His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.
他空着的那只手优雅地在空中写下微小的符号。

HAMLET
村庄

ou
LE DISTRAIT
勒迪斯特莱

Pièce de Shakespeare
莎士比亚戏剧

He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:
他对约翰·埃格林顿皱起了眉头重复了一遍：

—Pièce de Shakespeare, don’t you know. It’s so French. The French point of view. Hamlet ou …
——莎士比亚戏剧，你不知道吗？太法国了。法国人的观点。哈姆雷特或...

—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.
——心不在焉的乞丐，史蒂芬结束道。

John Eglinton laughed.
约翰·埃格林顿笑了。

—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.
——是的，我想是的，他说。毫无疑问，他们是优秀的人，但在某些事情上却目光短浅，令人痛苦。

Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
华丽而停滞的谋杀夸张。

—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one. Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.
——灵魂杀手罗伯特·格林称他为“灵魂杀手”，斯蒂芬说。他是屠夫的儿子，挥舞着雪橇，向手掌吐口水，这并非无缘无故。九个人的生命被夺去了他父亲的生命。我们在炼狱中工作的天父。卡其哈姆雷特毫不犹豫地开枪。第五幕中的血腥混乱是斯温伯恩先生所唱的对集中营的预言。

Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.
克兰利，我是他的沉默寡言的勤务兵，从远处跟踪战斗。

Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
凶残的敌人的幼崽和母亲

But we had spared …
但我们幸免于难……

Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.
在撒克逊人的微笑和美国佬的咆哮之间。恶魔与深海。

—He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best’s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.
——约翰·埃格林顿为了贝斯特先生的利益说道，他会认为《哈姆雷特》是一个鬼故事。就像《匹克威克》中的胖男孩一样，他想让我们毛骨悚然。

List! List! O List!
列表！列表！噢，名单！

My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.
我的肉体听到了他的声音：蠕动，听到了。

If thou didst ever …
如果你曾经……

—What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?
——什么是鬼？斯蒂芬带着刺痛的能量说道。一个因死亡、缺席、行为方式的改变而变得难以捉摸的人。伊丽莎白时代的伦敦距离斯特拉特福就像腐败的巴黎距离处女地都柏林一样远。那个从地狱边缘回到已经忘记他的世界的鬼魂是谁？哈姆雷特国王是谁？

John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
约翰·埃格林顿移动了他多余的身体，向后靠去判断。

Lifted.
举起。

—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.
——这是六月中旬一天中的这个时刻，史蒂芬说，迅速扫了一眼他们的听力。旗帜悬挂在河边的剧场上。萨克森熊在巴黎花园附近的坑里咆哮。与德雷克一起航行的帆布登山者在地面上嚼着香肠。

Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.
当地色彩。用你所知道的一切工作。让他们成为帮凶。

—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.
——莎士比亚离开了银街胡格诺派的住所，沿着河岸走过天鹅之家。但他并没有留下来喂养围栏，让她的小天鹅们在灯心草中嬉戏。雅芳的天鹅却有不同的想法。

Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
地方的组成。伊格内修斯·洛约拉，赶紧来帮助我吧！

—The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:
——好戏开始了。一名球员在阴影下登场，他穿着宫廷雄鹿废弃的铠甲，身材魁梧，声音低沉。它是幽灵，是国王，有国王却没有国王，而玩家是莎士比亚，他一生都在研究哈姆雷特，这并不是为了扮演幽灵的虚荣心。他对站在他面前的年轻球员伯比奇（Burbage）说了这样的话，呼唤着他的名字：

Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,
哈姆雷特，我是你父亲的灵魂，

bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
向他出示清单。他对一个儿子说话，他灵魂的儿子，王子，年轻的哈姆雷特，对他身体的儿子哈姆内特·莎士比亚，他在斯特拉特福去世，而他的同名者可以永远活着。

Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
有没有可能，那个玩家莎士比亚，一个缺席的幽灵，穿着埋葬丹麦的服装，一个死亡的幽灵，用自己的儿子的名字说出自己的话（如果哈姆内特·莎士比亚还活着，他将是哈姆雷特王子的双胞胎），是我想知道，或者很可能他没有得出或预见到这些前提的逻辑结论：你是被剥夺财产的儿子：我是被谋杀的父亲：你的母亲是有罪的女王，安·莎士比亚，出生于海瑟薇？

—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.
——但是，拉塞尔不耐烦地开始窥探一个伟人的家庭生活。

Art thou there, truepenny?
你在吗，真佩妮？

—Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts. We have King Lear: and it is immortal.
——只有教区职员感兴趣。我的意思是，我们有戏剧。我的意思是，当我们读《李尔王》的诗时，诗人的生活对我们有什么意义？至于生活，我们的仆人可以为我们做到这一点，维利尔斯·德利勒说过。窥视和窥探当天的休息室八卦、诗人的饮酒、诗人的债务。我们有《李尔王》：而且它是不朽的。

Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.
贝斯特先生的表情表示同意。

Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir …
用你的波浪和水流过它们，马纳南，马纳南麦克利尔……

How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?
先生，你饿的时候他借给你的那一英镑怎么样了？

Marry, I wanted it.
结婚吧，我想要的。

Take thou this noble.
就拿你这个贵族来说吧。

Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s daughter. Agenbite of inwit.
去！你大部分时间都在牧师女儿乔治娜·约翰逊的床上度过。因威特的阿根比特。

Do you intend to pay it back?
你打算还钱吗？

O, yes.
哦是啊。

When? Now?
什么时候？现在？

Well … No.
嗯……不。

When, then?
那么什么时候呢？

I paid my way. I paid my way.
我付了路费。我付了路费。

Steady on. He’s from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe it.
稳住。他来自博因水。东北角。你欠它。

Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got pound.
等待。五个月。分子都会改变。现在的我是另一个我。其他我得到了英镑。

Buzz. Buzz.
嗡嗡声。嗡嗡声。

But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms.
但我，隐德莱希，形式的形式，是我的记忆，因为在不断变化的形式下。

I that sinned and prayed and fasted.
我犯了罪，祈祷并禁食。

A child Conmee saved from pandies.
从 Pandies 手中救出的康米儿童。

I, I and I. I.
我，我，我，我。

A.E.I.O.U.

—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? John Eglinton’s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
——你的意思是要违背三个世纪的传统吗？约翰·埃格林顿用挑剔的声音问道。她的鬼魂至少已经永远埋葬了。至少对于文学来说，她在出生之前就去世了。

—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.
——史蒂芬反驳道，她出生六十七年后就去世了。她见证了他进出这个世界。她第一次拥抱了他。她生下了他的孩子，当他临终时，她把硬币放在他的眼睛上，让他的眼皮保持闭合。

Mother’s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. Liliata rutilantium.
母亲临终前的床边。蜡烛。镜子。把我带到这个世界的是谁就躺在那里，有着青铜色的盖子，在几朵廉价的花下。红叶百合。

I wept alone.
我独自哭泣。

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
约翰·埃格林顿看着灯里纠结的萤火虫。

—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.
——全世界都相信莎士比亚犯了一个错误，他说，但他却尽快、尽其所能地摆脱了这个错误。

—Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
——波什！史蒂芬粗鲁地说。天才的人是不会犯错误的。他的错误是自愿的，也是发现的门户。

Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
发现之门打开了，贵格会的图书管理员进来了，他脚步软弱，秃头，有耳朵，勤奋。

—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?
——约翰·埃格林顿精明地说，泼妇并不是一个有用的发现之门，人们应该想象。苏格拉底从克桑西佩那里学到了什么有用的发现？

—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (absit nomen!), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
——辩证法，斯蒂芬回答说：以及从他母亲那里如何将思想带入世界。他从他的另一位妻子米尔托（absit nomen！），苏格拉底迪翁的Epipsychidion那里学到了什么，没有男人，没有女人，会知道。但无论是助产士的传说，还是教主的演讲，都没有把他从新芬党的执政官和他们的铁杉树下拯救出来。

—But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
——但是安·海瑟薇呢？贝斯特先生平静的声音忘却地说道。是的，我们似乎正在忘记她，就像莎士比亚本人忘记了她一样。

His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.
他的目光从沉思者的胡须转向卡珀的头骨，提醒他们不要无情地责备他们，然后转向秃粉色的罗拉德科斯塔德，虽然受到诽谤，但无罪。

—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling The girl I left behind me. If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, Venus and Adonis, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.
——史蒂芬说，他非常机智，而且没有逃学的记忆。当他吹着口哨艰难地走向罗姆维尔时，他的钱包里装着一段记忆，《我留下的女孩》。如果地震没有发生，我们应该知道该把可怜的笏放在哪里，以他的形式坐着，猎犬的叫声，镶满钉子的缰绳和蓝色的窗户。维纳斯和阿多尼斯的记忆存在于伦敦每一个爱之光的卧室里。凯瑟琳这个泼妇不受欢迎吗？霍坦西奥称她年轻而美丽。你认为《安东尼与克利奥帕特拉》的作者，一个充满激情的朝圣者，他的眼睛在他的脑后，他选择了整个沃里克郡最丑陋的女人与之共眠吗？好：他离开了她，获得了男人的世界。但他的男男女女都是男孩的女人。她们的生命、思想、言语都是男性借给她们的。他选错了？在我看来，他被选中了。如果别人有自己的意愿，安就有办法。老实说，她应该受到责备。她把目光放在他身上，他可爱，二十六岁。灰眼女神向男孩阿多尼斯俯身，弯腰征服，作为膨胀行为的序幕，是一个大胆的斯特拉特福姑娘，她在玉米地里摔倒了一个比她年轻的情人。

And my turn? When?
轮到我了？什么时候？

Come!
来！

—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.
——莱菲尔德，贝斯特先生高兴地、高兴地举起他的新书，高兴地、高兴地说道。

He murmured then with blond delight for all:
然后他带着金发碧眼的喜悦低声说道：

Between the acres of the rye
在几英亩的黑麦之间

These pretty countryfolk would lie.
这些漂亮的乡下人会撒谎。

Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.
巴黎：令人愉快的取悦者。

A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.
一个留着胡须、穿着朴素衣服的高个子从阴影中站起来，揭开了合作手表的面纱。

—I am afraid I am due at the Homestead.
——恐怕我该到宅基地了。

Whither away? Exploitable ground.
去哪儿了？可利用的土地。

—Are you going? John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you at Moore’s tonight? Piper is coming.
-你要去吗？约翰·埃格林顿扬起眉毛问道。今晚我们在摩尔家见吧？派珀来了。

—Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?
——派珀！贝斯特先生吹奏着。派珀回来了吗？

Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.
彼得·派珀啄了一小撮泡椒。

—I don’t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away in time.
——我不知道我是否可以。周四。我们有我们的会议。如果我能及时逃脱的话。

Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. Isis Unveiled. Their Pali book we tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma. The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies tend them i’the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.
道森室中的 Yogibogeybox。伊希斯揭晓。我们试图典当他们的巴利文书籍。他盘腿在伞下，坐在阿兹特克标志的宝座上，在星体层面上发挥作用，他们的超灵，摩诃哈特玛。忠实的隐士们等待着光明，他们的友谊已经成熟，围绕着他。路易斯·H·胜利。 T·考尔菲尔德·欧文。莲花女士们照料他们的眼睛，他们的松果体闪闪发光。他充满了他的神，坐在宝座上，佛陀在车前草下。灵魂的吞噬者，吞噬者。他的灵魂，她的灵魂，灵魂的浅滩。他们被哀嚎的蠕虫吞没，旋转，旋转，哀号。

In quintessential triviality
在典型的琐碎中

For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.
多年来，她的灵魂一直居住在这个肉壳里。

—They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.
——他们说我们要得到一个文学上的惊喜，贵格会图书管理员友好而认真地说。有传言称，罗素先生正在收集一捆我们年轻诗人的诗句。我们都焦急地期待着。

Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.
他焦急地朝灯光锥里看了一眼，那里有三张脸，闪闪发光。

See this. Remember.
看到这个。记住。

Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with two index fingers. Aristotle’s experiment. One or two? Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal, one hat is one hat.
史蒂芬低头看着一个宽大的无头卡宾，他的梣木把手挂在膝盖上。我的头盔和剑。用两个食指轻轻触摸。亚里士多德的实验。一个或两个？必然性是指凭借它，一个人不可能有其他的情况。盘藻，一顶帽子就是一顶帽子。

Listen.
听。

Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part. Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express. O, will he? I liked Colum’s Drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth a Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you’ll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn’s wild oats? Awfully clever, isn’t it? They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O’Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.
年轻的科勒姆和斯塔基。乔治·罗伯茨负责商业部分。朗沃斯会在 Express 中好好地吸一口。哦，他会吗？我喜欢科勒姆的畜牧者。是的，我认为他有那种奇怪的天才。你认为他真的有天才吗？叶芝很欣赏他的诗句：就像在荒野中的希腊花瓶。他是吗？我希望你今晚能来。玛拉基·穆里根也来了。摩尔请他带上海恩斯。你听到米切尔小姐关于摩尔和马丁的笑话了吗？摩尔是马丁的野燕麦吗？非常聪明，不是吗？他们让人想起堂吉诃德和桑丘·潘萨。西格森博士说，我们的民族史诗尚未书写。摩尔就是这样的人。都柏林的一位面容悲伤的骑士。搭配藏红花短裙？奥尼尔·拉塞尔？哦，是的，他一定会说古老的语言。还有他的杜尔西内亚？詹姆斯·斯蒂芬斯正在画一些巧妙的草图。看来我们正在变得重要。

Cordelia. Cordoglio. Lir’s loneliest daughter.
科迪莉亚。科多格里奥。李尔最孤独的女儿。

Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.
努克肖滕。现在你最好的法语波兰语。

—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman …
——非常感谢你，拉塞尔先生，斯蒂芬站起来说道。如果您能将这封信交给诺曼先生……

—O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much correspondence.
-哦是啊。如果他认为重要的话就会进去。我们有很多信件。

—I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.
——我明白，史蒂芬说。谢谢。

God ild you. The pigs’ paper. Bullockbefriending.
上帝保佑你。猪的纸。布洛克交友。

Synge has promised me an article for Dana too. Are we going to be read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.
辛格答应我也给达纳写一篇文章。我们会被阅读吗？我觉得我们是。盖尔联盟想要爱尔兰语的东西。我希望你今晚能过来。带上斯塔基。

Stephen sat down.
史蒂芬坐了下来。

The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:
贵格会的图书管理员来自告别者。他的面具红着脸说道：

—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.
——迪达勒斯先生，您的观点最具启发性。

He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
他吱吱作响地来回走动，蹑手蹑脚地爬到离天空更近的地方，高度相当于一架小飞机，然后，被外出的噪音所掩盖，低声说道：

—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?
——那么，你认为她对诗人不忠诚吗？

Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?
一脸惊慌地问我。他为什么来？礼貌还是内心的光芒？

—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.
——史蒂芬说，哪里有和解，就必定先有分裂。

—Yes.
-是的。

Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters’ wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.
克里斯福克斯穿着皮衣，躲藏在枯萎的树叉中，躲避喧嚣和哭泣。不识狐狸精，孤独走在追逐中。他为他赢得了女人，温柔的人们，巴比伦的妓女，法官的女士，恶霸酒鬼的妻子。狐狸和鹅。在新广场，她那一具松弛、不光彩的身体，曾经是美丽的，曾经像肉桂一样甜美、新鲜，现在她的叶子纷纷落下，全都光秃秃的，害怕狭窄的坟墓，无法被宽恕。

—Yes. So you think …
-是的。所以你认为 …

The door closed behind the outgoer.
门在外出者身后关上了。

Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.
这座隐蔽的拱形牢房突然安静下来，空气温暖而阴沉。

A vestal’s lamp.
一盏维斯塔灯。

Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.
在这里，他思考不存在的事情：如果凯撒相信占卜者的话，他会活着做什么：可能会发生什么：可能的可能性：未知的事情：阿喀琉斯生活在女人中间时叫什么名字。

Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks.
我周围的思想被封闭在木乃伊箱里，用言语的香料进行防腐。托特，图书馆之神，鸟神，月冠。我听到了埃及大祭司的声音。在装满瓷砖书的彩绘房间里。

They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.
他们还在。曾经在男人的大脑中很快出现过。尽管如此，他们还是渴望死亡，想在我耳边告诉我一个伤感的故事，催促我践踏他们的意志。

—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.
——约翰·埃格林顿沉思道，当然，在所有伟人中，他是最神秘的一个。我们只知道他活着并受苦。甚至没有那么多。其他人接受我们的问题。阴影笼罩着其余一切。

—But Hamlet is so personal, isn’t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don’t care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty …
——但是哈姆雷特很有个性，不是吗？贝斯特先生恳求道。我的意思是，一种有关他私生活的私人文件，你知道吗？我的意思是，我不在乎一个按钮，你不知道吗，谁被杀了，谁有罪……

He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. His private papers in the original. Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim in mo shagart. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.
他把一本无辜的书放在桌子边上，露出蔑视的微笑。他的私人文件原件。 Ta an bad ar an tir。泰姆在莫沙加特。把贝拉放在上面，小约翰。

Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
小约翰·埃格林顿说：

—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
——我已经做好了应对马拉奇·穆里根告诉我们的悖论的准备，但我不妨警告你，如果你想动摇我对莎士比亚就是哈姆雷特的信念，你面前就有一项艰巨的任务。

Bear with me.
耐心听我说。

Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows. A basilisk. E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.
斯蒂芬经受住了皱皱的眉毛下闪烁着严厉光芒的恶毒眼睛的祸害。蛇怪。 E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca。布鲁内托先生，我感谢您的发言。

—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.
——当我们，或者母亲达纳，编织和解开我们的身体时，斯蒂芬说，日复一日，它们的分子来回穿梭，艺术家也编织和解开他的形象。正如我右胸上的痣是我出生时的位置，尽管我的身体一次又一次地被新的东西编织而成，所以通过不安的父亲的鬼魂，死去的儿子的形象出现了。雪莱说，在想象力的强烈瞬间，当心灵是一块正在褪色的煤炭时，我曾经的样子就是我现在的样子，而且我可能会成为这样的人。因此，在未来，过去的姐妹，我可能会看到我现在坐在这里的自己，但通过对那时我将成为的人的反思。

Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
霍桑登的德拉蒙德在那个栅栏上帮助了你。

—Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.
——是的，贝斯特先生年轻地说。我觉得哈姆雷特还很年轻。痛苦可能来自父亲，但与奥菲莉亚的段落肯定来自儿子。

Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
有错误的母猪。他在我父亲里面。我在他的儿子里。

—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
——那颗鼹鼠是最后一个消失的，斯蒂芬笑着说。

John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
约翰·埃格林顿的割草动作并不令人愉快。

—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.
——如果那是天才的胎记，他说，天才就会成为市场上的毒品。雷南非常欣赏的莎士比亚晚年的戏剧散发着另一种精神。

—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
——和解的精神，贵格会图书管理员的呼吸。

—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.
——斯蒂芬说，如果没有分裂，就不可能和解。

Said that.
这么说。

—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?
——如果你想知道是什么事件给《李尔王》、《奥赛罗》、《哈姆雷特》、《特洛伊罗斯》和《克瑞西达》的地狱时光投下了阴影，那就看看阴影何时以及如何升起。什么能软化一个在可怕的风暴中遭遇海难的人的心，像另一位尤利西斯、伯里克利、提尔王子一样受过考验？

Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.
头，红色圆锥形，受到冲击，盐水盲。

—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.
——一个孩子，一个女孩，放在他怀里，玛丽娜。

—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.
——约翰·埃格林顿发现，诡辩家对伪经的偏向是一个恒定的量。大路虽然沉闷，但通向城镇。

Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats. Cypherjugglers going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of the moon: Tir na n-og. Booted the twain and staved.
好的培根：发霉了。莎士比亚培根的野燕麦。密码杂耍者走上大路。伟大追求的探索者。哪座城市，有好的师傅吗？默记的名字有：A.E.，永无止境：Magee、John Eglinton。太阳以东，月亮以西：Tir na n-og。启动双胞胎并停止。

How many miles to Dublin?
到 都柏林 有多少英里？

Three score and ten, sir.
三分十，先生。

Will we be there by candlelight?
我们会在烛光下到达吗？

—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.
——斯蒂芬说，布兰德斯先生接受了它，作为闭幕期的第一部剧。

—Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?
——是吗？西德尼·李（Sidney Lee）先生或西蒙·拉扎勒斯（Simon Lazarus）先生（有些人称他的名字叫西蒙·拉扎勒斯）对此有何评论？

—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s child. My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?
——斯蒂芬说，玛丽娜是风暴之子，米兰达是奇迹，佩迪塔是失去的东西。失去的东西又归还给了他：他女儿的孩子。伯里克利说，我最亲爱的妻子就像这个女仆。如果一个男人不爱母亲，他还会爱女儿吗？

—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. l’art d’être grand …
——做祖父的艺术，贝斯特先生甘低声说道。伟大的艺术……

—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?
——难道他不会在她身上看到重生，加上自己年轻时的记忆，另一个形象吗？

Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus …
你知道你在说什么吗？爱，是的。这句话是人尽皆知的。 Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus …

—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.
——对于一个拥有那种奇怪的天才的人来说，他自己的形象是所有经验的标准，无论是物质的还是道德的。这样的呼吁会触动他。其他与他有血缘关系的男性的形象会让他感到厌恶。他会在其中看到大自然试图预言或重复自己的怪诞行为。

The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
贵格会图书管理员仁慈的额头因希望而红润起来。

—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have been.
——我希望迪达勒斯先生能够提出他的理论来启迪公众。我们应该提到另一位爱尔兰评论员，萧伯纳先生。我们也不应该忘记弗兰克·哈里斯先生。他在《周六评论》上发表的有关莎士比亚的文章无疑非常精彩。奇怪的是，他也为我们描绘了与十四行诗中黑暗女士的不愉快关系。最受青睐的对手是彭布罗克伯爵威廉·赫伯特。我承认，如果诗人必须被拒绝，那么这种拒绝似乎更符合——我该怎么说？——我们关于不应该发生的事情的观念。

Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize of their fray.
他高兴地停下来，把一个温顺的头放在它们中间，那是海雀的蛋，它们争斗的战利品。

He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?
他千方百计地用严肃的丈夫话语来对待她。你爱吗，米丽亚姆？你爱你的男人吗？

—That may be too, Stephen said. There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.
——也可能是这样，史蒂芬说。马吉先生喜欢引用歌德的一句话。当心你年轻时的愿望，因为你会在中年得到它。为什么他要派一个布奥纳罗巴（buonaroba），一个所有人都可以乘坐的海湾，一个有着丑闻少女时代的伴娘，一个贵族来向他求爱？他本人就是一位语言之王，使自己成为一位科斯特雷尔绅士，他写下了《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。为什么？对自己的信心被过早地扼杀了。他首先在玉米地里（我应该说是黑麦地）屈服了，之后他永远不会成为他自己眼中的胜利者，也不会胜利地玩笑和躺下的游戏。假设东焦万尼主义不会拯救他。后来的撤消无法撤消第一个撤消。野猪的獠牙伤害了他，那里的爱情正在流血。即使泼妇被击败，她的女人的隐形武器仍然存在。我从这句话中感觉到，某种肉体的刺激驱使他陷入一种新的激情，一种比第一个激情更黑暗的阴影，甚至使他对自己的理解变得模糊。同样的命运在等待着他，两种愤怒在​​漩涡中交织在一起。

They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
他们列出。我倒在他们耳边的门廊里。

—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.
——灵魂曾遭受过致命的打击，就像毒药倒在熟睡的耳朵的门廊里。但那些在睡梦中死去的人无法知道他们的镇压方式，除非他们的造物主在来世赋予他们的灵魂这种知识。如果哈姆雷特国王没有被造物主赋予知识，他的鬼魂就不可能知道中毒和催促它的两背野兽。这就是为什么演讲（他那瘦弱的、不可爱的英语）总是转向别处，向后。掠夺和掠夺，他愿意却不愿意的，从卢克丽丝的蓝圈象牙球到伊莫金的胸部，裸露的，有五彩斑的痣。他回去了，厌倦了他为了隐藏自己而堆积起来的创造物，就像一只老狗舔着旧疮一样。但是，因为失去就是他的收获，他以不减的人格走向永恒，不受他所写下的智慧或他所揭示的法则的教导。他的海狸站起来了。他现在是一个幽灵，一个影子，是埃尔西诺岩石边的风，或者你愿意的什么，是大海的声音，一种只能在他心中听到的声音，他是他影子的实体，是与父亲同质的儿子。

—Amen! was responded from the doorway.
——阿门！门口传来回应。

Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
我的敌人啊，你找到我了吗？

Entr’acte.
入口。

A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.
巴克·穆里根的脸粗俗，像院长一样阴沉，他走上前来，然后穿着杂色衣服，愉快地迎接他们微笑的问候。我的电报。

—You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he asked of Stephen.
——你说的是气态脊椎动物，如果我没记错的话？他问斯蒂芬。

Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.
他披着Primroseves，像对待一件小玩意一样，用他那头已脱下的巴拿马草帽高兴地打招呼。

They make him welcome. Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen.
他们让他受到欢迎。 Du verlachst wirt Du noch dienen。

Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.
一群嘲笑者：福提乌斯、伪马拉奇、约翰·莫斯特。

He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.
他自己在圣灵中诞生，他自己派遣自己，阿根买尔，在自己和其他人之间，他被他的恶魔放在身上，剥光并鞭打，像蝙蝠一样钉在谷仓门上，饿死在十字树上，谁让他埋葬，站起来，痛苦的地狱，进入天堂，在那里，这一千九百年坐在他自己的右手边，但在末后的日子里，当所有的生者都已经死了的时候，他将毁灭生者和死者。

Glo—o—ri—a in ex—cel—sis De—o.
Glo-o-ri-a in ex-cel-sis De-o。

He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.
他举起双手。面纱落下。噢，鲜花！铃铃铃铃铃响。

—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
——是的，确实如此，贵格会图书管理员说。最具启发性的讨论。恕我直言，穆里根先生对于戏剧和莎士比亚也有他的理论。生活的各个方面都应该得到体现。

He smiled on all sides equally.
他向四面八方微笑。

Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
巴克·穆里根疑惑地想：

—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
——莎士比亚？他说。我好像知道这个名字。

A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
他松垮的五官里洋溢着灿烂的笑容。

—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.
——当然，他说，记得很清楚。那个像辛格那样写作的家伙。

Mr Best turned to him.
贝斯特先生转向他。

—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at the D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht.
——海恩斯想念你，他说。你见过他吗？稍后他会在 D.B.C. 见你。他去吉尔那里买了海德的《康诺特情歌》。

—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
——我穿过博物馆，巴克·穆里根说。他在这儿吗？

—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
——约翰·埃格林顿回答说，吟游诗人的同胞们也许对我们的理论才华感到相当厌倦。我听说昨晚有一位女演员在都柏林第四百次扮演哈姆雷特。维宁认为王子是一位女性。没人看出他是爱尔兰人吗？我相信巴顿法官正在寻找一些线索。他以圣帕特里克之名发誓（殿下，不是勋爵）。

—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
——其中最精彩的是王尔德的故事，贝斯特先生举起他精彩的笔记本说道。在《W. H. 先生的肖像》中，他证明十四行诗是由威利·休斯（Willie Hughes）写的，他是一个形形色色的人。

—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
——对于威利·休斯来说，不是吗？贵格会图书管理员问道。

Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
还是休吉·威尔斯？威廉先生本人。 W.H.：我是谁？

—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.
——我的意思是，对于威利·休斯来说，贝斯特先生轻松地修正了自己的言辞。当然，这都是悖论，你不知道吗，休斯、休斯、色调、颜色，但他解决问题的方式是如此典型。这就是王尔德的精髓，你知道吗？轻触。

His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.
他的目光轻轻碰触到他们的脸庞，他微笑着，就像一个金发碧眼的人。驯服王尔德的精髓。

You’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.
你真是太机智了。你和丹·迪西的金币一起喝了三杯乌斯奎堡酒。

How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
我花了多少钱？哦，几先令。

For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
对于一群丰满的新闻记者来说。幽默有干有湿。

Wit. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
机智。你愿意为他恶作剧时所穿着的骄傲的制服付出你的五分智慧。满足欲望的轮廓。

There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.
有很多莫。就带她来给我吧。在配对时间。天哪，送他们一个很酷的生活。是的，斑鸠她。

Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.
前夕。赤裸裸的麦腹罪。一条蛇缠绕着她，用毒牙咬住她。

—Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
——你认为这只是一个悖论吗？贵格会的图书管理员问道。嘲笑者在最严肃的时候从来不会被认真对待。

They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.
他们严肃地谈论嘲笑者的严肃性。

Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
巴克·穆里根的脸再次变得沉重，看了史蒂芬一会儿。然后，他摇着头走近，从口袋里掏出一份折叠起来的电报。他移动的嘴唇读着，带着新的喜悦微笑。

—Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
-电报！他说。美妙的灵感！电报！教皇的公牛！

He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
他坐在没有灯光的书桌一角，高兴地大声念道：

—The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!
——感伤主义者是那些愿意享受某件事而不会为所做的事情承担巨额债务的人。署名：迪达勒斯。你从哪里启动它？基普斯？不，学院绿。这四块钱你喝了吗？姨妈要去拜访你那个虚无缥缈的父亲。电报！ Malachi Mulligan，The Ship，下修道院街。哦，你这个绝世哑剧！哦，你这尊祭司的金奇特！

Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:
他高兴地把信和信封塞进口袋，但用一种抱怨的粗俗语尖刻地说：

—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ‘Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
——这就是我要告诉你的，亲爱的先生，海恩斯和我自己把这件事带进来的时候，我们真是奇怪又病态。“我想，我们为鸡药所做的低语会唤醒一个修士，他因舔舐而跛行。我们在康纳利的客厅里坐了一个小时、两个小时、三个小时，等待每人喝一杯。

He wailed:
他哀嚎道：

—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
——我们在那里，马夫龙，而你在不知情的情况下向我们发送你的聚合体，就像我们把舌头伸出一码长一样，就像那些干涸的神职人员确实昏倒了一样。

Stephen laughed.
斯蒂芬笑了。

Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
巴克·穆里根迅速地、警告地弯下了腰。

—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to murder you.
——流浪汉辛格正在寻找你，他说，是为了谋杀你。他听到你在格拉斯胡尔的走廊门上撒尿。他穿着大衣出来要谋杀你。

—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
-我！斯蒂芬惊呼道。这就是你对文学的贡献。

Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.
巴克·穆里根高兴地弯下腰，对着黑暗的天花板大笑。

—Murder you! he laughed.
——杀了你！他笑了。

Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle. C’est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i’the forest.
在圣安德烈艺术街，那张严峻的石像鬼脸因我们杂乱的灯光而与我发生冲突。一字一句地说，帕拉布拉斯。奥辛与帕特里克。他在克拉马尔树林里遇到了挥舞着酒瓶的农夫曼。这是vendredi圣人！谋杀爱尔兰人。他的形象，徘徊着，他遇见了。我的。我在森林里遇到了一个傻瓜。

—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
——莱斯特先生，一名服务员在半开的门里说道。

— … in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms … Yes? What is it?
——……每个人都可以找到自己的。所以麦登法官在威廉·沉默大师的日记中找到了狩猎术语……是吗？它是什么？

—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.
——先生，这里有一位绅士，服务员说道，同时上前递出一张名片。来自弗里曼。他想看看基尔肯尼人去年的档案。

—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman? …
——当然，当然，当然。是绅士吗？ ……

He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:
他接过那张热切的卡片，看了一眼，没有看到，就躺了下来，看了看，问道，吱吱作响，问道：

—Is he? … O, there!
-是他？ ……哦，那里！

Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.
他跳起欢快的歌，出发了，出局了。在日光照射下的走廊里，他满怀热忱、滔滔不绝、尽职尽责、最公平、最仁慈、最诚实。

—This gentleman? Freeman’s Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good day, sir. Kilkenny … We have certainly …
——这位先生？弗里曼的日记？基尔肯尼人？为了确定。美好的一天，先生。基尔肯尼……我们当然有……

A patient silhouette waited, listening.
一个耐心的剪影等待着，倾听着。

—All the leading provincial … Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903 … Will you please? … Evans, conduct this gentleman … If you just follow the atten … Or, please allow me … This way … Please, sir …
——所有省级领导人……北辉格党、科克审查员、恩尼斯科西卫报，1903 年……可以吗？ ……埃文斯，引导这位先生……如果您只是按照注意事项……或者，请允许我……这边走……请，先生……

Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.
他能言善辩，尽职尽责，带路去见所有的省级报纸，一个弯着腰的黑影跟在他匆忙的后面。

The door closed.
门关上了。

—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
——闪亮的！巴克·穆里根哭了。

He jumped up and snatched the card.
他跳起来，抢走了卡。

—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
-他叫什么名字？艾基·摩西？盛开。

He rattled on:
他喋喋不休地说：

—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.
——耶和华，包皮收集者，已经不复存在了。我在博物馆找到了他，我在那里向泡沫出生的阿芙罗狄蒂致敬。希腊人的嘴从来没有在祈祷时扭曲过。我们每天都必须向她致敬。生命的生命，你的嘴唇燃烧。

Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
突然他转向斯蒂芬：

—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the maiden hid.
——他认识你。他认识你的老家伙。哦，我害怕我，他比希腊人更希腊化。他那双苍白的伽利略眼睛正盯着她的内侧沟。维纳斯·卡利皮格。哦，那些腰部的雷鸣！追赶少女的神躲了起来。

—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
——我们想听更多，约翰·埃格林顿在贝斯特先生的同意下决定。我们开始对S太太感兴趣。直到现在，我们还认为她（如果有的话）是一个耐心的格里塞尔达，一个留在家里的佩内洛普。

—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s blankets: William the conqueror came before Richard III. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.
——史蒂芬说，高尔吉亚的学生安提斯泰​​尼从基里奥斯·墨涅拉俄斯的母马阿尔吉夫·海伦（特洛伊的木母马，睡着二十位英雄的木母马）手中夺走了美丽的手掌，并将其交给了可怜的佩内洛普。他在伦敦生活了二十年，其中一部分时间的薪水与爱尔兰大法官的薪水相当。他的生活很丰富。他的艺术不仅仅是沃尔特·惠特曼所说的封建主义艺术，而是一种过度的艺术。热鲱鱼馅饼、绿色麻袋、蜂蜜酱、玫瑰糖、杏仁饼干、醋栗鸽子、林格糖果。当他们逮捕沃尔特·罗利爵士时，他背负着五十万法郎，其中包括两件漂亮的衣服。女官伊丽莎·都铎（Eliza Tudor）已经拥有足够的底线，可以与她争夺示巴。二十年来，他在婚姻之爱及其纯洁的快乐和风流之爱及其肮脏的快乐之间徘徊。你知道曼宁厄姆的故事，讲述了一位市民的妻子在《理查三世》中看到迪克·伯比奇后，请他上床睡觉的故事，以及莎士比亚如何无意中听到的，没有更多的麻烦，抓住了牛的角，当伯比奇来敲门时”，阉鸡的毯子里回答道：征服者威廉出现在理查三世之前。还有同性恋拉金、费顿情妇、骑马和哭泣的O，以及他精致的小鸟，佩内洛普·里奇女士，一个干净的优质女人，适合玩家，还有银行边的朋克，一次一便士。

Cours la Reine. Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?
王后大道。再来一次。 Nous ferons de petites cochnneries。米内特？你好吗？

—The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxford’s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.
——美好社会的高度。牛津大学母亲的威廉·达维南爵士（William Davenant）则为任何公鸡金丝雀提供了一杯金丝雀。

Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
巴克·穆里根虔诚地仰起眼睛，祈祷道：

—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
——有福的玛格丽特·玛丽·安科克！

—And Harry of six wives’ daughter. And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?
——还有六个妻子的女儿哈利。绅士诗人劳恩·丁尼生 (Lawn Tennyson) 吟唱着邻座的其他女性朋友的歌声。但是，这二十年来，你认为斯特拉特福可怜的佩内洛普在钻石窗后面做什么呢？

Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno’s eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
做就做。事情完成了。他走在草药师杰拉德费特巷的玫瑰园里，灰色的多伯恩。蓝色的兔耳草就像她的血管一样。朱诺的眼睑，紫罗兰色。他走。一个生命就是全部。一具身体。做。但确实如此。远处，在欲望和肮脏的恶臭中，双手放在白色上。

Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.
巴克·穆里根猛烈地敲击约翰·埃格林顿的桌子。

—Whom do you suspect? he challenged.
——你怀疑谁？他挑战道。

—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
——说他是十四行诗中被唾弃的情人。一次被唾弃，两次被唾弃。但朝廷却肆无忌惮地抛弃了他，把他当做一个领主，他的亲爱的爱人。

Love that dare not speak its name.
不敢说出自己名字的爱。

—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.
——作为一个英国人，你的意思是，约翰·斯特朗·埃格林顿插话道，他爱一位领主。

Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
老墙上突然出现蜥蜴闪烁。在查伦顿我看着他们。

—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.
——看来是这样，史蒂芬说，当他想为他和所有其他奇异的无耳子宫做马夫为种马做的神圣职责时。也许，就像苏格拉底一样，他的母亲是一个助产士，就像他的妻子是一个泼妇一样。但她，这个放荡的舞男，并没有违背誓言。在那个鬼魂的心目中，有两件事是最重要的：一个是违背誓言，另一个是她不再青睐的愚笨乡巴佬，即已故丈夫的兄弟。我想，可爱的安是热血沸腾的。一次求爱者，两次求爱者。

Stephen turned boldly in his chair.
斯蒂芬在椅子上大胆地转身。

—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you deny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.
——举证责任在你而不是我，他皱着眉头说道。如果你否认在《哈姆雷特》的第五幕中他给她打上了耻辱的烙印，请告诉我为什么从她嫁给他那天到埋葬他那天之间的三十四年里没有提到她。所有这些女人都看到她们的男人陷入困境：玛丽，她的好人约翰，安，她可怜的亲爱的威伦，当他死在她身上时，她为他是第一个离开而愤怒，琼，她的四个兄弟，朱迪思，她的丈夫还有她所有的儿子，苏珊，还有她的丈夫，而苏珊的女儿伊丽莎白，用祖父的话来说，是在杀死了她的第一个之后，嫁给了她的第二个。

O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.
哦，是的，提到有。当他在伦敦皇家生活富裕时，为了偿还债务，她不得不向她父亲的牧羊人借了四十先令。那你解释一下吧。请解释一下他将她推荐给后人的绝唱。

He faced their silence.
他面对他们的沉默。

To whom thus Eglinton:
埃格林顿对谁说：

You mean the will.
你说的是意志。


But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
但我相信法学家已经对此做出了解释。

She was entitled to her widow’s dower
她有权获得寡妇的嫁妆

At common law. His legal knowledge was great
在普通法中。他的法律知识非常渊博

Our judges tell us.
我们的法官告诉我们。

Him Satan fleers,
撒但逃跑了，

嘲笑者：

 And therefore he left out her name
因此他省略了她的名字

From the first draft but he did not leave out
从初稿开始，但他没有遗漏

The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,

For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
为了他的妹妹，为了他在斯特拉特福的老朋友

And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
在伦敦。因此，当他被催促时，

As I believe, to name her

—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
——约翰·埃格林顿观察到，当时漂亮的乡下人几乎没有动产，如果我们的农民戏剧符合类型的话，他们仍然拥有动产。

—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?
——斯蒂芬说，他是一位富有的乡村绅士，拥有徽章、斯特拉特福的地产和爱尔兰院子里的房子，是资本家股东、法案发起人、什一税农民。如果他希望她能安静地打呼噜度过余下的夜晚，为什么不把最好的床留给她呢？

—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.
——显然有两张床，一张是最好的，一张是次好的，次佳先生精妙地说。

—Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.
——门萨与丘脑的分离，击败了巴克·穆里根，受到了微笑。

—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. Let me think.
——古代提到过著名的床，第二个埃格林顿皱着眉头，对着床微笑。让我想想。

—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
——史蒂芬说，古代提到过鹿角学童和秃头异教徒圣人，他在流放中死去时释放并赐予了他的奴隶，向他的长辈致敬，愿意被安葬在他死去妻子的骨头附近，并嘱咐他的朋友们要友善送给一位老情妇（别忘了内尔·格温·赫皮利斯）并让她住在他的别墅里。

—Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean …
——你的意思是他就这么死了？贝斯特先生有些关切地问道。我是说 …

—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
——巴克·穆里根（Buck Mulligan）喝醉了，他死了。一夸脱啤酒是国王的菜肴。噢，我必须告诉你道登所说的话！

—What? asked Besteglinton.
-什么？贝斯特格林顿问道。

William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people’s William. For terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house …
威廉·莎士比亚及其有限公司。人民的威廉.适用条款：E. Dowden、Highfield house……

—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days. Lovely!
-迷人的！巴克·穆里根深情地吸了一口气。我问他对针对这位吟游诗人的鸡奸指控有何看法。他举起双手说道：我们只能说，那个时候的生活是非常美好的。迷人的！

Catamite.
卡塔米特。

—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.
——美丽的感觉会让我们误入歧途，美丽的悲伤最好对丑陋的埃格林顿说。

Steadfast John replied severe:
坚定的约翰严厉地回答道：

—The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake and have it.
——医生可以告诉我们这些话的意思。鱼与熊掌不可兼得。

Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?
你是这么说的吗？他们会从我们、从我手中夺走美丽的手掌吗？

—And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in Love’s Labour Lost. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s theory of equivocation. The Sea Venture comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired The Merry Wives of Windsor, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.
——还有财产感，斯蒂芬说。他从自己的长口袋里掏出夏洛克。他是麦芽商人和放债人的儿子，他自己也是玉米商人和放债人，在饥荒骚乱中囤积了十吨玉米。他的借款人无疑是切特尔·福斯塔夫提到的那些崇拜者，他们报告了他的正直交易。他以几袋麦芽的价格起诉了一位同伴，并勒索了他每借出一磅肉的利息。奥布里的马夫和服务生怎么能快速致富呢？所有的事件都给他的工厂带来了好处。夏洛克与女王的水蛭洛佩兹被吊死并切成四等分后的犹太人诱饵相呼应，他的犹太人的心在光泽还活着的时候就被拔出来了：哈姆雷特和麦克白随着一位苏格兰哲学家登上王位而转向施行巫术。迷失的无敌舰队是他在《爱的劳动的失败》中的嘲笑。他的选美、历史，在马菲金热情的浪潮中扬帆起航。沃里克郡的耶稣会士经过了考验，我们有波特的模棱两可理论。 《海上冒险》从百慕大回到家乡，雷南欣赏的这部戏剧是与我们的美国表弟帕齐·卡利班 (Patsy Caliban) 共同创作的。甜腻的十四行诗紧随西德尼的十四行诗之后。至于费伊·伊丽莎白，也就是胡萝卜色的贝丝，这个为《温莎的风流娘儿们》提供灵感的粗鄙处女，却让阿尔曼尼的一些小人物在他的生活中摸索，渴望在钱袋深处寻找深藏的意义。

I think you’re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological. Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.
我觉得你们相处得很好。只是混合了神学哲学的混合物。 Mingo、Minxi、mictum、mingere。

—Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,’expectantly. Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.
——约翰·埃格林顿敢于证明他是犹太人，“满怀期待。”你们的院长认为他是神圣罗马人。

Sufflaminandus sum.
Sufflaminandus 总和。

—He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.
——斯蒂芬回答说，他是德国人，是意大利丑闻的法国抛光者。

—A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.
——贝斯特先生提醒道，他是一个多才多艺的人。柯勒律治称他多才多艺。

Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos.
安普利乌斯。在人类社会中，最有必要的是相互间的友好。

—Saint Thomas, Stephen began …
——圣托马斯，斯蒂芬开始……

—Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.
——Ora pro nobis，蒙克·穆里根呻吟着，坐到椅子上。

There he keened a wailing rune.
他在那里尖声念出哀号符文。

—Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! It’s destroyed we are from this day! It’s destroyed we are surely!
——波格·马宏！阿库什拉马赫里！从今天起我们就被毁了！我们肯定被毁了！

All smiled their smiles.
大家都露出了笑容。

—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.
——圣托马斯，斯蒂芬微笑着说道，我喜欢读他的原作，从不同于马吉先生所说的新维也纳学派的立场来描写乱伦，他以他明智而好奇的方式将乱伦比作贪婪。情绪。他的意思是，如此给予血缘近亲的爱却被贪婪地拒绝给某个可能渴望这种爱的陌生人。基督徒对犹太人征收贪婪的税，他们是所有种族中最热衷通婚的。指责是在愤怒中提出的。基督教法律为犹太人积累了财富（对于他们来说，就像罗拉德派一样，暴风雨就是庇护所），也用钢圈束缚了他们的感情。无论这些是罪恶还是美德，老Nobodaddy都会在世界末日告诉我们。但是，一个男人如果对他所谓的债务如此紧握他所谓的权利，他也会紧紧抓住他对他称之为妻子的她的所谓权利。微笑先生的邻居不会觊觎他的牛、他的妻子、他的男仆、他的女仆或他的驴子。

—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.
——或者是他的珍妮亚斯，巴克·穆里根对着电话说道。

—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.
——温柔的威尔受到了粗暴的对待，温柔的贝斯特先生温和地说。

—Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.
——哪个会？巴克·穆里根甜甜地堵住了嘴。我们变得混杂起来。

—The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s widow, is the will to die.
——约翰·埃格林顿（John Eglinton）认为，对于威尔的遗孀可怜的安来说，求生的意愿就是求死的意愿。

—Requiescat! Stephen prayed.
——安息吧！斯蒂芬祈祷。

What of all the will to do?
那么所有要做的事情的意愿又是什么呢？

It has vanished long ago …
早就消失了……

—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the Merry Wives and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches and The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.
——她僵硬地躺在那张第二好的床上，那张移动的女王，尽管你证明当时的床和现在的汽车一样稀有，而且它的雕刻是七个教区的奇迹。年老时，她开始与福音传教士交往（其中一个在新广场和她住在一起，喝了镇议会付钱买的一夸脱麻袋酒，但他睡在哪一张床上，不用问），听说她有灵魂。她读过或者读过他的小册子，比起《快乐的妻子》，她更喜欢这些小册子，每晚在约旦河上喝水时，她想到了《信徒马裤的钩眼》和《让最虔诚的灵魂打喷嚏的最具灵性的鼻烟盒》。维纳斯在祈祷中扭动嘴唇。 Agenbite of inwit：良心的悔恨。这是一个精疲力尽的淫乱探索其神的时代。

—History shows that to be true, inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos. The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man’s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.
——历史表明，Eglintonus Chronolologos 的说法是正确的。岁月交替。但我们有最高权威认为，一个人最大的敌人应该是他自己的家庭和家人。我觉得拉塞尔是对的。我们关心他的妻子或父亲什么？应该说，只有家庭诗人才有家庭生活。福斯塔夫不是一个顾家的男人。我感觉胖骑士就是他的至高创造。

Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there’s a gentleman to see you. Me? Says he’s your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.
身体一倾，他躺了回去。害羞，否认你的亲属，非科引导者。他害羞地与不敬虔的人共进晚餐，偷偷地偷走了杯子。奥尔顿·安特里姆的一位父亲吩咐他这样做。每个季度都会来这里拜访他。马吉先生，先生，有位先生要见您。我？说他是你的父亲，先生。给我我的华兹华斯。玛吉·莫尔·马修上场了，他是一个粗犷、粗糙、粗头的克恩，穿着斜挎包，扣着纽扣，下身沾满了十片森林的克劳伯，手里拿着一根野性魔杖。

Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.
你自己？他认识你的老家伙。鳏夫。

Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.
从快乐的巴黎码头边匆匆赶往她肮脏的死亡巢穴时，我碰了碰他的手。那声音，新的温暖，在说话。鲍勃·肯尼医生正在照顾她。祝我一切顺利的眼睛。但不认识我。

—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. Amor matris, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?
——斯蒂芬说，与绝望作斗争的父亲是一种必要的邪恶。他在父亲去世后的几个月里写了这部剧。如果你认为他，一个头发花白的男人，有两个即将结婚的女儿，已经三十五岁了，五十岁的生活经验，是来自维滕贝格的没有胡子的本科生，那么你一定认为他七十岁的母亲是好色的女王。不，约翰·莎士比亚的尸体不会在夜间行走。它一小时又一小时地腐烂。他休息了，解除了父亲身份的武装，为他的儿子设计了神秘的财产。薄伽丘笔下的卡兰德里诺是第一个也是最后一个感觉到自己怀孕的人。从有意识的生育意义上来说，父亲身份对于人类来说是未知的。这是一个神秘的产业，一个使徒的继承，从独生子到独生子。教会是建立在这个神秘的基础上，而不是建立在狡猾的意大利知识分子向欧洲暴民扔来的圣母玛利亚上，而且是不可动摇地建立起来的，因为它像世界一样，无论是宏观还是微观，都是建立在虚空之上的。基于不确定性，基于不可能。 Amor matris，主观所有格和客观所有格，可能是生活中唯一真实的东西。亲子关系可能是一个法律虚构。谁是儿子的父亲，让儿子爱他，或者他爱儿子？

What the hell are you driving at?
你到底开什么车？

I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.
我知道。住口。炸死你。我有理由。

Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.
安普利乌斯。阿杜克。迭代。波斯蒂亚。

Are you condemned to do this?
你被谴责这样做吗？

—They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.
——他们被身体上的耻辱所割裂，这种耻辱是如此坚定，以至于世界的犯罪史册上沾满了所有其他乱伦和兽行，几乎没有记录它的突破。儿子和母亲，父亲和女儿，同性恋姐妹，不敢说出自己名字的爱人，侄子和祖母，囚犯和钥匙孔，女王和奖品公牛。未出生的儿子火星美：出生后，他带来痛苦，分割感情，增加关怀。他是一个新的男性：他的成长是他父亲的衰落，他的青春是他父亲的嫉妒，他的朋友是他父亲的敌人。

In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.
我是在王子先生街上想到的。

—What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.
——本质上是什么将它们联系在一起？瞬间的盲目车辙。

Am I a father? If I were?
我是父亲吗？如果我？

Shrunken uncertain hand.
萎缩的不确定的手。

—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.
——萨贝利乌斯，非洲人，野外所有野兽中最狡猾的异端邪说创始人，他认为天父本身就是他自己的儿子。阿奎那的斗牛犬反驳了他，与它交谈是不可能的。那么：如果没有儿子的父亲就不是父亲，那么没有父亲的儿子还能是儿子吗？当拉特兰巴康苏汉普顿莎士比亚或另一位同名诗人在错误喜剧中写下哈姆雷特时，他不仅仅是自己儿子的父亲，而且不再是一个儿子，他是并且感觉自己是所有种族的父亲，他的父亲自己的祖父，也就是他未出生的孙子的父亲，出于同样的原因，孙子也从未出生过，因为正如马吉先生所理解的那样，大自然厌恶完美。

Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.
埃格林顿的眼睛里充满了喜悦，害羞地抬起头来。一个快乐的清教徒，透过扭曲的白玉兰，高兴地瞥了一眼。

Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.
奉承。很少。但比较扁平。

—Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play’s the thing! Let me parturiate!
——他自己的父亲，桑穆利根告诉自己。等待。我已经有孩子了。我的脑子里有一个未出生的孩子。帕拉斯·雅典娜！一出戏！戏才是正事！让我临产吧！

He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.
他用两只助产的手捂住大腹便便的眉毛。

—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in Coriolanus. His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in King John. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in The Tempest, in Pericles, in Winter’s Tale are we know. Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.
——至于他的家人，史蒂芬说，他母亲的名字住在雅顿森林里。她的死让他想起了科利奥兰纳斯与沃伦尼亚的场景。他儿子的死就是《约翰王》中年轻亚瑟的死亡场景。黑王子哈姆雷特就是哈姆尼特·莎士比亚。 《暴风雨》、《伯里克利》、《冬天的故事》中的女孩是谁，我们都知道。我们可以猜到埃及的肉罐子克利奥帕特拉、克雷西德和维纳斯是谁。但他的另一位家庭成员也被记录下来。

—The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.
——情节变得更加复杂，约翰·埃格林顿说。

The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack.
贵格会的图书管理员，颤抖着，蹑手蹑脚地走进去，颤抖着，他的面具颤抖着，颤抖着，嘎嘎声。

Door closed. Cell. Day.
门关着。细胞。天。

They list. Three. They.
他们列出。三。他们。

I you he they.
我你他他们。

Come, mess.
来吧，乱七八糟。

STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on’s back. The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.
斯蒂芬：他有三个兄弟，吉尔伯特、埃德蒙、理查德。年老的吉尔伯特告诉一些骑士，有一次他做弥撒时，他暂时得到了收集大师的通行证，他看到他的粗壮的剧作家沃尔大师在伦农上演一场摔跤戏，背上有一个男人。剧场里的香肠充满了吉尔伯特的灵魂。他无处可去：但可爱的威廉的作品中记录了埃德蒙和理查德。

MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What’s in a name?
MAGEEGLINJOHN： 名字！名字里有什么？

BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know. I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake.
BEST：这是我的名字，理查德，你不知道吗？我希望你能为理查德说几句好话，你知道吗，为了我。

BUCKMULLIGAN: (Piano, diminuendo)
BUCKMULLIGAN：（钢琴，渐弱）

Then outspoke medical Dick
然后直言不讳的医学迪克

To his comrade medical Davy …
致他的医学战友戴维……

STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in King Lear, two bear the wicked uncles’ names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.
史蒂芬：在他的黑色遗嘱三位一体中，《李尔王》中的恶棍沙包、伊阿古、理查德·克鲁克巴克、埃德蒙，其中两个都以邪恶叔叔的名字命名。不仅如此，最后一部戏剧是他的兄弟埃德蒙在南华克病危时写成的或正在写成的。

BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don’t want Richard, my name …
BEST：我希望埃德蒙能抓住它。我不想要理查德，我的名字……

(Laughter)
（笑声）

QUAKERLYSTER: (A tempo) But he that filches from me my good name …
奎克利斯特：（节奏）但他偷走了我的好名声……

STEPHEN: (Stringendo) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o’Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What’s in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.
斯蒂芬：（斯特林多）他在戏剧中隐藏了自己的名字，一个公平的名字，威廉，这里是超级英雄，那里是小丑，就像一位古老的意大利画家将脸放在画布的黑暗角落里一样。他在十四行诗中揭示了这一点，那里有威尔的过剩。就像约翰·奥冈特一样，他的名字对他来说很珍贵，就像他为之谄媚的外套和徽章一样珍贵，就像他在弯曲的貂皮上插着一根长矛或钢制的银币一样珍贵，比他在这个国家最伟大的震撼场面的荣耀更珍贵。名字里有什么？这就是我们童年时写下别人告诉我们的名字时问自己的问题。一颗星星，一颗晨星，一条火龙，随着他的诞生而升起。白天，它独自在天空中闪耀，比夜间的金星还要亮，到了晚上，它就照耀在仙后座的三角洲上空，仙后座是一个卧着的星座，是他在群星中名字首字母的签名。当他午夜从肖特利和她的怀抱返回时，走过沉睡的夏日田野，他的眼睛注视着它，它低垂在地平线上，在熊的东边。

Both satisfied. I too.
双方都满意。我也。

Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.
别告诉他们火熄灭时他才九岁。

And from her arms.
并从她的怀里。

Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?
等待被追求并赢得胜利。哎呀，胆小鬼。谁会追求你？

Read the skies. Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos. Where’s your configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: sua donna. Già: di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare S. D.
读懂天空。自主性。布斯·斯蒂芬努梅诺斯。你的配置在哪里？史蒂芬，史蒂芬，把面包切均匀。 S.D：亲爱的。 Già：迪卢伊。 gelindo risolve di non amare S. D.

—What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?
——那是什么，迪达勒斯先生？贵格会图书管理员问道。这是天体现象吗？

—A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.
——夜晚的星星，斯蒂芬说。白天的云柱。

What more’s to speak?
还有什么好说的？

Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.
史蒂芬看了看他的帽子、他的手杖、他的靴子。

Stephanos, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.
斯蒂芬诺斯，我的王冠。我的剑。他的靴子破坏了我脚的形状。买一双。我的袜子破了洞。还有手帕。

—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.
——你很好地利用了这个名字，约翰·埃格林顿承认。你自己的名字也够奇怪的。我想这可以解释你的奇幻幽默。

Me, Magee and Mulligan.
我、马吉和穆里根。

Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. Pater, ait. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.
了不起的技师。鹰一样的男人。你飞了。去哪儿？纽黑文-迪耶普，统舱乘客。巴黎并返回。田凫。伊卡洛斯。佩特，艾特。海底布满泥水，跌落，翻滚。你是田凫。田凫是。

Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
贝斯特先生急切地安静地举起书本说道：

—That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales. The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.
——这很有趣，因为你不知道吗，我们在古老的爱尔兰神话中也发现了兄弟的动机。就是你说的。莎士比亚三兄弟。在格林童话里，你不知道吗？总是娶睡美人并获得最佳奖品的三弟。

Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.
最好的兄弟中的最好的。好，更好，最好。

The quaker librarian springhalted near.
贵格会的图书管理员在附近停下来。

—I should like to know, he said, which brother you … I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers … But perhaps I am anticipating?
——我想知道，他说，你是哪位兄弟……我理解你暗示其中一位兄弟有不当行为……但也许我正在期待？

He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.
他发现自己陷入了困境：看着一切：克制住了。

An attendant from the doorway called:
门口的服务员喊道：

—Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants …
——莱斯特先生！迪宁神父想要……

—O, Father Dineen! Directly.
——噢，迪宁神父！直接地。

Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.
很快，吱吱作响，他就消失了。

John Eglinton touched the foil.
约翰·埃格林顿碰触了箔纸。

—Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn’t you?
——来吧，他说。让我们听听您对理查德和埃德蒙的评价。你把它们留到最后，不是吗？

—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.
——在请你记住那两位高贵的亲戚里奇叔叔和埃德蒙叔叔时，斯蒂芬回答说，我觉得我的要求也许太多了。兄弟就像雨伞一样容易被遗忘。

Lapwing.

Where is your brother? Apothecaries’ hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.
你的兄弟在哪里？药剂师大厅。我的磨刀石。他，然后是克兰利，穆里根：现在是这些。演讲，演讲。但行动吧。行动演讲。他们嘲笑要尝试你。行为。付诸行动。

Lapwing.

I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.
我厌倦了我的声音，以扫的声音。我的王国，喝一杯。

On.
在。

—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others? Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of King Lear in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?
——你会说这些名字已经在他的戏剧素材的编年史中了。为什么他要带走他们而不是其他人？理查德，一个私生子的妓女驼背，与寡妇安（名字是什么？）做爱，向她求爱并赢得了她，一个快乐的妓女寡妇。征服者理查德，第三兄弟，是在被征服者威廉之后出现的。该剧的其他四幕与第一幕无关。在他所有的国王中，理查是唯一没有受到莎士比亚——世界天使——的尊敬的保护的国王。为什么《李尔王》的底层情节中埃德蒙的形象是从悉尼的阿卡迪亚升起的，并被随意地讲述了一个比历史更古老的凯尔特传说？

—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. Que voulez-vous? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.
——这就是威尔的方式，约翰·埃格林顿辩解道。我们现在不应该将挪威传奇故事与乔治·梅雷迪思小说的摘录结合起来。 Que voulez-vous？摩尔会说。他把波西米亚放在海岸上，让尤利西斯引用亚里士多德的话。

—Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you like It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure—and in all the other plays which I have not read.
-为什么？斯蒂芬自己回答道。因为虚假、篡夺、通奸的兄弟或三者合一的主题是莎士比亚的主题，穷人不是，但总是与他同在。从《维罗纳二绅士》开始，放逐的音符、从内心放逐、从家放逐的声音就不间断地响起，直到普洛斯彼罗折断他的手杖，将其埋入地下几英寻，淹没了他的书。它在他的生命中重演，在另一个生命中反映自己，重复自己，原态，上位，灾难，灾难。当他临近坟墓时，当他已婚的女儿苏珊（旧街区的居民）被指控通奸时，这种情况再次重演。但正是原罪使他的悟性变得黑暗，削弱了他的意志，并在他的内心留下了强烈的邪恶倾向。这些话是我的梅努斯主教大人说的。原罪，就像原罪一样，是由另一个人所犯的，他也犯了罪。它就在他最后写下的字里行间，被石化在他的墓碑上，她的四块骨头不能放在下面。岁月并没有令它枯萎。美丽与和平并没有消除它。在他所创造的世界里，到处都是无穷无尽的变化，《无事生非》、《皆大欢喜》、《暴风雨》、《哈姆雷特》、《一报还一报》——以及所有其他我没有读过的戏剧中。

He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.
他笑了，让自己的心灵摆脱了心灵的束缚。

Judge Eglinton summed up.
埃格林顿法官总结道。

—The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all.
——事实是半途而废，他断言。他是幽灵，也是王子。他是一切的一切。

—He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. All in all. In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.
——他是的，史蒂芬说。第一幕的男孩是第五幕的成熟男人。总而言之。在《辛白林》和《奥赛罗》中，他都是淫荡的、戴绿帽子的。他行动，也被行动。理想或变态的情人，就像何塞一样，他杀死了真正的卡门。他不懈的才智就像狂野的伊阿古一样，不断地愿意让他内心的荒原遭受苦难。

—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
-布谷鸟！布谷鸟！库克·穆里根猥亵地咯咯笑起来。噢，恐惧之言！

Dark dome received, reverbed.
黑暗的穹顶收到了，产生了回响。

—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas père?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.
——伊阿古是一个多么有个性的人啊！无所畏惧的约翰·埃格林顿惊呼道。总而言之，杜马斯菲尔斯（或者是杜马斯父亲？）是对的。莎士比亚创造了上帝之后的大部分。

—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet père?) and Hamlet fils. A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.
——男人不会让他高兴，女人也不会，史蒂芬说。他结束了缺席的生活，回到了他出生的地方，他一直在那里，男人和男孩，一个沉默的见证者，在那里，他的生命旅程结束了，他把桑树种在了地上。然后死了。动议结束。掘墓人埋葬了哈姆雷特父亲？）和哈姆雷特之子。国王和王子最终在音乐的陪伴下死去。而且，尽管遭到谋杀和背叛，但无论是丹麦人还是都柏林人，所有脆弱温柔的心都为之哭泣，但为死者感到悲伤的是他们唯一拒绝离婚的丈夫。如果你喜欢尾声，请仔细看下去：繁荣的普洛斯彼罗，好人得到了回报，莉齐，爷爷的爱人，里奇叔叔，坏人，被诗意的正义带到了坏黑鬼去的地方。坚固的窗帘。他在外部世界中尽可能真实地发现了他内部世界中的东西。梅特林克说：如果苏格拉底今天离开他的家，他会发现这位圣人坐在他家门口。如果犹大今晚出去，他的脚步将走向犹大。每一个生命都是很多天，日复一日。我们走过自己，遇到强盗、鬼怪、巨人、老人、年轻人、妻子、寡妇、兄弟情人，但总是遇见我们自己。这位剧作家写下了这个世界的对开本，而且写得很糟糕（他首先给了我们光明，两天后给了太阳），万物之主，最罗马的天主教徒称其为迪奥·博亚（dio boia），刽子手之神，无疑是所有的一切。在我们所有人身上，马夫和屠夫，也可能是妓女和戴绿帽子的人，但在天堂的经济中，哈姆雷特预言，不再有婚姻，荣耀的男人，一个雌雄同体的天使，成为自己的妻子。

—Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!
——尤里卡！巴克·穆里根哭了。尤里卡！

Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s desk.
他突然高兴地跳了起来，大步走到约翰·埃格林顿的办公桌前。

—May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.
-我可以？他说。主已对玛拉基说话。

He began to scribble on a slip of paper.
他开始在一张纸上乱写乱画。

Take some slips from the counter going out.
出门时从柜台拿一些小票。

—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.
——那些已婚的人，贝斯特先生，杜斯先驱说，除了一个人以外，所有人都应该活下去。其余保持原样。

He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.
未婚的他嘲笑埃格林顿·约翰内斯，艺术系的单身汉。

Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew.
未婚，没有幻想，充满诡计，他们每晚都在琢磨他的各种版本的《驯悍记》。

—You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?
——你是个妄想，约翰·埃格林顿严厉地对斯蒂芬说。你带我们走了这么远，就是为了给我们展示一个法国三角。你相信你自己的理论吗？

—No, Stephen said promptly.
——不，史蒂芬立即说道。

—Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.
——你要写吗？贝斯特先生问道。你应该把它变成对话，你知道吗，就像王尔德写的柏拉图对话一样。

John Eclecticon doubly smiled.
约翰·埃克莱克肯露出双重笑容。

—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment for it since you don’t believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.
——好吧，既然如此，他说，我不明白为什么你应该期待付款，因为你自己都不相信。道登认为《哈姆雷特》中存在一些谜团，但不愿透露更多。派珀在柏林遇到的布莱特鲁先生正在研究拉特兰理论，他相信这个秘密就隐藏在斯特拉特福纪念碑中。派珀说，他将拜访现任公爵，并向他证明这些戏剧是他的祖先写的。这会让他的恩典感到惊讶。但他相信他的理论。

I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.
我相信，主啊，请帮助我的不信。也就是说，帮助我相信还是帮助我不相信？谁帮忙相信？伊戈曼。不信谁呢？其他章节。

—You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver. Then I don’t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.
——你是唯一向达纳索要银币的捐助者。然后我就不知道下一个数字了。弗雷德·瑞安 (Fred Ryan) 想要发表一篇有关经济学的文章。

Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.
弗莱德琳.他借给我两块银子。帮你渡过难关。经济学。

—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.
——史蒂芬说，只要一个几尼，你就可以发表这篇采访。

Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:
巴克·穆里根从他那大笑的涂鸦中站起来，大笑起来：然后严肃地说，充满甜蜜的恶意：

—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.
——我拜访了吟游诗人金奇位于上梅克伦堡街的避暑别墅，发现他正在深入研究《反外邦人大全》，身边还有两位患有淋病的女士，弗雷什·耐莉和煤码头妓女罗莎莉。

He broke away.
他挣脱了。

—Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.
——来吧，金奇。来吧，流浪的鸟儿安格斯。

Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.
来吧，金奇。你已经把我们剩下的都吃完了。哎呀。我将为您服务您的五脏六腑。

Stephen rose.
史蒂芬站了起来。

Life is many days. This will end.
人生有很多天。这将会结束。

—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. Notre ami Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.
——我们今晚见，约翰·埃格林顿说。摩尔圣母院说马拉奇·穆里根一定在那儿。

Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
巴克·穆里根炫耀他的衬裙和巴拿马草裙。

—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland. I’ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?
——摩尔先生，他说，法国致爱尔兰青年信件的讲师。我会在那里。来吧，金奇，吟游诗人必须喝酒。你能直走吗？

Laughing, he …
笑起来，他……

Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
一直喝到十一点。爱尔兰之夜的娱乐活动。

Lubber …
橡胶…

Stephen followed a lubber …
斯蒂芬跟着一个笨蛋……

One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.
有一天，我们在国家图书馆进行了一场讨论。摇晃。后。他回过头：我跟着。我把他气坏了。

Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.
史蒂芬打了个招呼，然后就全心全意地跟在一个笨蛋小丑后面，他的头梳理得很整齐，刚剃过胡子，出了拱形牢房，走进了一片没有思想的破碎的日光里。

What have I learned? Of them? Of me?
我学到了什么？他们当中？我的？

Walk like Haines now.
现在像海恩斯一样走路。

The constant readers’ room. In the readers’ book Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet mad? The quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.
固定的阅览室。在读者书中，卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔模仿了他的多音节词。项目：哈姆雷特疯了吗？贵格会教徒虔诚地与一位牧师谈论书籍。

—O please do, sir … I shall be most pleased …
——哦，请这样做，先生……我将非常高兴……

Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
巴克·穆里根被逗乐了，他自言自语地自言自语，自言自语道：

—A pleased bottom.
——满意的屁股。

The turnstile.
十字转门。

Is that? … Blueribboned hat … Idly writing … What? Looked? …
就是它？ ……蓝丝带帽子……闲着写……什么？看过吗？ ……

The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.
弯曲栏杆：平滑滑动的 Mincius。

Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
帕克·穆里根 (Puck Mulligan) 戴着巴拿马头盔，一步一步地走着，边走边拖曳：

John Eglinton, my jo, John,
约翰·埃格林顿，我的朋友，约翰，

Why won’t you wed a wife?
为什么不娶个老婆呢？

He spluttered to the air:
他对着空中结结巴巴地说：

—O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall. Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.
——啊，没有下巴的中国人！ Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton。海恩斯和我，我们去了他们的游戏室，水管工大厅。我们的球员正在为欧洲创造一种新的艺术，就像希腊人或梅特林克一样。艾比剧院！我闻到了和尚的阴汗味。

He spat blank.
他口吐白沫。

Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left the femme de trente ans. And why no other children born? And his first child a girl?
忘记了：就像他忘记了露西给他的那一顿糟糕的鞭打一样。并留下了特伦特女士。为什么没有其他孩子出生？他的第一个孩子是女孩吗？

Afterwit. Go back.
事后。回去。

The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair.
那个阴沉的隐士还在那里（他有他的蛋糕），还有那个可爱的年轻人，快乐的奴才，费多那可玩弄的金发。

Eh … I just eh … wanted … I forgot … he …
呃……我只是呃……想要……我忘了……他……

—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there …
——朗沃斯和麦克迪·阿特金森也在场……

Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
帕克·穆里根 (Puck Mulligan) 脚步矫健，颤抖着：

I hardly hear the purlieu cry
我几乎听不到purlieu的哭声

Or a tommy talk as I pass one by
或者当我经过时汤米的谈话

Before my thoughts begin to run
在我的思绪开始奔跑之前

On F. M’Curdy Atkinson,

Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.

—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.
——悲伤的哑剧演员，巴克·穆里根呻吟道。辛格不再穿黑色衣服，以回归自然。只有乌鸦、牧师和英国煤炭是黑色的。

A laugh tripped over his lips.
他的唇边浮现出一丝笑意。

—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?
——朗沃斯病得很重，在你写了关于那个老鳕鱼格雷戈里的文章后，他说。噢，你这个好奇的醉酒犹太人！她给你找了一份报纸上的工作，然后你去把她的胡言乱语写给杰苏斯。你就不能像叶芝那样接触吗？

He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
他继续走下去，拖地，挥舞着优美的手臂，念叨着：

—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. One thinks of Homer.

He stopped at the stairfoot.

The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men’s morrice with caps of indices.

He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
他大笑着，耷拉着脑袋，继续前行，斯蒂芬跟在后面：他愉快地对影子、人类的灵魂说：

—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
——噢，在卡姆登大厅的那个夜晚，当你躺在桑葚色、五彩缤纷、大量的呕吐物中时，艾琳的女儿们不得不掀起裙子从你身上跨过去！

About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.

They followed.
他们遵循。

Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.
基尔代尔街上的房屋都洋溢着亲切的气氛。没有鸟。两缕烟雾从屋顶上脆弱地升起，羽状地，轻轻地吹着。

* * * * *

The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy’s name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham’s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.
上级是令人尊敬的约翰·康米·S.J.当他走下长老会的台阶时，他把光滑的手表放回了内袋里。五比三。正是步行前往 Artane 的好时机。那个男孩又叫什么名字？迪格南。是的。 Vere dignum et iustum est. 天鹅兄弟就是要见的人。坎宁安先生的信。是的。如果可以的话，请答应他。良好的实用天主教徒：在传教时有用。

A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.
一个单腿水手，懒洋洋地摇着拐杖，向前摇晃着，低声咆哮着。他在慈善修女会修道院前猛地一闪，向约翰·康米·S·J牧师伸出一顶鸭舌帽，向他寻求施舍。康米神父在阳光下祝福他，因为他知道，他的钱包里藏着一顶银冠。

Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
康米神父穿过马路来到蒙特乔伊广场。他想起了双腿被炮弹打断的士兵和水手，在贫民病房里结束了自己的日子，想起了红衣主教沃尔西的话：如果我像侍奉我的国王一样侍奉我的上帝，他就会没有在我过去的日子里抛弃我。他走过阳光闪烁的树叶树荫：向他走来的是国会议员戴维·希伊先生的妻子。

—Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?
——确实很好，父亲。那你呢，父亲？

Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.
康米神父的身体确实非常好。他可能会去巴克斯顿去水。还有她的孩子们，他们在丽城相处得好吗？是这样吗？康米神父听到这个消息确实非常高兴。那么谢伊先生本人呢？还在伦敦。可以肯定的是，房子仍然坐着。天气真好，确实令人愉快。是的，伯纳德·沃恩神父很可能会再次来传教。噢，是的：非常成功。真是一个很棒的男人。

Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.
康米神父很高兴见到 M.P. David Sheehy 先生的妻子。他看上去气色很好，恳求大家记住大卫·希伊 (David Sheehy) 议员。是的，他肯定会打电话。

—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.
——下午好，希伊夫人。

Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.
康米神父在告别时摘下丝帽，微笑着看着她头巾上的墨珠在阳光下闪闪发光。并再次微笑着走开。他知道，他已经用槟榔膏清洁了牙齿。

Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.
康米神父边走边笑，因为他想起了伯纳德·沃恩神父滑稽的眼睛和伦敦腔的声音。

—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?
——彼拉多！你为什么不回去那群猫头鹰呢？

A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in. his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?
然而，一个热心的人。他确实是。并且确实以他的方式做了很多好事。毫无疑问。他说，他爱爱尔兰，也爱爱尔兰人。好的家庭也会有人认为吗？威尔士人，不是吗？

O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.
哦，免得他忘记了。那封信给省里的父亲。

Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
康米神父在蒙特乔伊广场的拐角处拦住了三个小学生。是的：他们来自丽城。小房子。啊哈。他们在学校是好孩子吗？ O. 现在这样就很好了。他叫什么名字？杰克·索汉.他的名字呢？德国加拉赫。另一个小个子呢？他的名字叫布鲁尼·莱纳姆。哦，这是一个非常好的名字。

Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.
康米神父将胸前的一封信递给布伦尼·莱纳姆大师，并指着菲茨吉本街拐角处的红色邮筒。

—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.
——但请注意，小伙子，你别把自己塞进盒子里，他说。

The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
男孩们六眼看着康米神父，笑道：

—O, sir.
——哦，先生。

—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.
——好吧，让我看看你是否可以寄封信，康米神父说。

Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.
布伦尼·莱纳姆大师跑过马路，把康米神父写给外省父亲的信放进了鲜红色的信箱口。康米神父微笑着点点头，微笑着沿着蒙特乔伊广场向东走去。

Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.
丹尼斯·J·马金尼 (Denis J Maginni) 先生，舞蹈与舞蹈学教授，头戴丝质礼帽，身穿镶有丝绸饰面的石板色长袍，系着白色方巾领带，身穿淡紫色紧身裤，戴着金丝雀手套，脚踩尖头漆皮靴，以严肃的举止行走，当他经过麦克斯韦夫人时，他非常恭敬地走上路边石。迪格纳姆法庭的一角。

Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?
那不是麦吉尼斯夫人吗？

Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?
麦吉尼斯夫人，一头银发，庄严庄重，在航行时所经过的更远的小路上向康米神父鞠躬。康米神父微笑着行礼。她做得怎么样？

A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a … what should he say? … such a queenly mien.
她有一辆漂亮的马车。就像苏格兰女王玛丽之类的。没想到她还是个当铺！现在好了！这样的……该怎么说呢？ ……真是女王般的风度。

Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will(D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.
康米神父沿着大查尔斯街走去，瞥了一眼左边那座没有关闭的教堂。 T. R. Greene 牧师 B.A.将（D.V.）发言。他们称他为现任者。他觉得自己有责任说几句话。但人应该有慈善心。无知无敌。他们按照自己的灯光行事。

Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.
康米神父拐过街角，沿着北环路走。如此重要的大道上竟然没有电车线路，真是一个奇迹。当然，应该有。

A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.
一群背着书包的男生从里士满街穿过。所有人都抬起了凌乱的帽子。康米神父不止一次亲切地向他们打招呼。基督教兄弟男孩。

Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph’s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.
康米神父一边走，一边闻到右手上有一股焚香的味道。圣约瑟夫教堂，波特兰街。适合年老贤惠的女性。康米神父向圣体礼致敬。善良：但有时他们也会脾气暴躁。

Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.
在奥尔德伯勒宅邸附近，康米神父想起了那个挥霍无度的贵族。现在它是一间办公室什么的。

Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.
康米神父开始沿着北岸路行走，站在店门口的威廉·加拉格尔先生向他致意。康米神父向威廉·加拉格尔先生致敬，闻到了来自巴克利奇和充足的黄油的气味。他经过格罗根的《烟草商》，新闻版靠着它，讲述了纽约发生的一场可怕的灾难。在美国，这些事情不断发生。不幸的人就这样毫无准备地死去。尽管如此，这是一种完美的忏悔行为。

Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.
康米神父路过丹尼尔·伯金的酒馆，窗边有两个不劳作的人懒洋洋地躺着。他们向他敬礼，也受到敬礼。

Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.
康米神父经过 H·J·奥尼尔的葬礼场所，科尼·凯莱赫在那里一边嚼着一片干草，一边在日记本上记下数字。一名巡逻的警察向康米神父敬礼，康米神父向警察敬礼。在尤克斯泰特猪肉店里，康米神父观察到猪肉布丁，白色、黑色和红色，整齐地卷曲在管子里。

Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.
康米神父停泊在查尔维尔购物中心的树下，看见一艘草皮驳船，一匹低垂着头的拖马，一位戴着肮脏稻草帽的船夫坐在船中央，一边抽烟，一边盯着头顶上的一根白杨树枝。这是田园诗般的景象：康米神父反思了造物主的旨意，造物主在沼泽中创造了草皮，人们可以将其挖出来，带到城镇和小村庄，在穷人的房子里生火。

On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.
在纽科门桥上，尊敬的约翰·康米·S.J.在加德纳上街的圣弗朗西斯泽维尔教堂，踏上一辆向外开行的电车。

Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.
北威廉街圣阿加莎教堂的尼古拉斯·达德利 (Nicholas Dudley C.C.) 牧师下了一辆向内开行的电车，来到纽科门桥。

At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.
在纽科门桥，康米神父登上一辆向外开行的电车，因为他不喜欢步行穿过泥岛的肮脏道路。

Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.
康米神父坐在电车的一角，一张蓝色的车票小心翼翼地塞在一只胖乎乎的小山羊皮手套的孔眼里，而四先令、一便士和五便士则从他另一只胖乎乎的小手套里滑落进他的钱包。经过常春藤教堂时，他想到检票员通常会在人们不小心扔掉票的时候来检查。在康米神父看来，车内乘客的庄严对于如此短途且廉价的旅程来说显得有些过分了。康米神父喜欢开朗的礼仪。

It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.
这是平静的一天。康米神父对面的那位戴眼镜的绅士解释完毕，低下头。康米神父猜想是他的妻子。戴眼镜的绅士妻子张开了嘴，打了个小哈欠。她举起戴着手套的小拳头，轻轻地打了个哈欠，用戴着手套的小拳头轻拍着张开的嘴，甜甜地微笑着。

Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.
康米神父在车里闻到了她的香水味。他还察觉到她另一边那个尴尬的男人正坐在座位的边缘。

Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
祭坛栏杆旁的康米神父艰难地把主人送到了那位摇着头、笨拙的老人嘴里。

At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.
电车在安斯利桥停下来，正要开动时，一位老妇人突然从座位上站起来，下了车。售票员拉动车铃带，帮她把车停住。她带着篮子和市场网昏倒了：康米神父看到售票员帮助她，把网和篮子放下来：康米神父认为，由于她快要花完便士票价了，所以她是那些善良的人之一。总是被告知两次，保佑你，我的孩子，他们已经被赦免了，为我祈祷。但他们的生活有太多的忧虑，太多的忧虑，可怜的生物。

From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.
尤金·斯特拉顿先生在围墙上对康米神父做了个鬼脸，嘴唇厚厚的。

Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des Élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God’s souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.
康米神父想到了黑人、棕色人和黄种人的灵魂，也想到了他关于圣彼得·克拉弗 S.J. 的布道。以及非洲的使命和信仰的传播，以及数以百万计的黑人、棕色人和黄色灵魂的传播，当他们的最后时刻像夜里的小偷一样到来时，他们还没有接受水的洗礼。康米神父认为，比利时耶稣会士所著的《Le Nombre des Élus》一书是一个合理的请求。这些是上帝按照自己的形象创造的数以百万计的人类灵魂，但信仰（D.V.）还没有被带给他们。但他们是上帝的灵魂，是上帝创造的。在康米神父看来，他们都失去了，这似乎是一种遗憾，如果可以说，这是一种浪费。

At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.
在霍斯路站，康米神父下了车，售票员向他敬礼，他也向他敬礼。

The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.
马拉海德路很安静。康米神父、道路和名字都令他高兴。欢乐铃以欢快的马拉海德语响起。塔尔博特·德·马拉海德勋爵，马拉海德及其邻近海域的直系世袭海军上将。然后，战斗的号角响起，她在一夜之间成为女仆、妻子和寡妇。那是旧世俗的日子，欢乐城镇里的忠诚时光，男爵领地的旧时光。

Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.
康米神父一边走，一边想起他的小书《男爵领地的旧时光》，以及可能写的关于耶稣会修道院和丽城第一伯爵夫人莫尔斯沃斯勋爵的女儿玛丽·罗奇福特的书。

A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband’s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.
一位不再年轻的无精打采的女士独自走在埃内尔湖岸边，玛丽，丽城的第一伯爵夫人，在傍晚无精打采地行走，当水獭掉下来时没有受到惊吓。谁能知道真相呢？如果她没有与她丈夫的兄弟完全通奸，那么嫉妒的贝尔韦代雷勋爵和她的忏悔神父就不会是这样吗？如果她不像女人一样都犯了罪，她会半承认的。只有上帝知道，还有她和他，她丈夫的兄弟。

Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.
康米神父想到了人类在地球上的种族所需要的那种残暴的失禁，以及上帝的道路，但与我们的道路不同。

Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.
唐·约翰·康米（Don John Conmee）在过去的时代是行走和移动的。他在那里很仁慈并受到尊重。他牢记着坦白的秘密，在涂满蜂蜡的客厅里，他对着高贵的笑脸微笑，客厅的天花板上挂满了水果串。唐·约翰·康米（Don John Conmee）刺穿了新娘和新郎的双手，无论贵族还是贵族。

It was a charming day.
这是一个迷人的一天。

The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and homely word.
康米神父在田野的草坪上看到了大片的卷心菜，卷心菜的下叶充足，正在向他行屈膝礼。天空向他展示了一群小白云，慢慢地顺风而行。法国人说，木桐纳。一个公正而亲切的词。

Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.
康米神父一边阅读他的办公室，一边看着拉思科菲上空的一群阴云。他穿着薄袜的脚踝被克朗戈斯田地里的胡茬弄得发痒。他晚上散步到那里看书，听到男孩们玩耍时的台词叫声，安静的夜晚里年轻人的叫声。他是他们的教区长：他的统治很温和。

Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.
康米神父脱下手套，拿出红边祈祷书。一个象牙书签告诉了他那一页。

Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.
没有。他应该在午饭前读过这篇文章。但麦克斯韦夫人来了。

Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium.
康米神父偷偷地读着《佩特》和《艾维》，并在胸前画了十字。神在礼堂里。

He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.
他平静地走着，默默地读着《无》，边走边读，直到读到《Res in Beati immaculati: Principium v​​erborum tuorum veritas: in eternumomnia indicia iustitiae tuae》。

A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
一个满脸通红的年轻人从树篱的缝隙中走了出来，紧随其后的是一位年轻女子，手里拿着狂野点头的雏菊。年轻人突然举起帽子；年轻女子突然弯下腰，小心翼翼地从轻薄的裙子上取下一根紧贴着的树枝。

Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.
康米神父严肃地祝福两人，并翻开了薄薄的一页祈祷书。罪：迫害原理免费：et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum。

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
科尼·凯莱赫合上他那本长长的日记本，低垂的眼睛瞥了一眼角落里放哨的松木棺材盖。他直起身子，走向它，在轴上旋转它，观察它的形状和黄铜家具。他嚼着干草片，把棺材盖放在一边，来到门口。他歪着帽檐遮住眼睛，靠在门框上，懒洋洋地向外张望。

Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.
约翰·康米神父登上纽科门桥上的多利蒙特电车。

Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.
科尼·凯莱赫锁住他的大脚靴，低垂着帽子，一边凝视着，一边嚼着干草片。

Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.
警员 57C 则站着打发时间。

—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.
——今天天气很好，凯莱赫先生。

—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.
——嗯，科尼·凯莱赫说。

—It’s very close, the constable said.
——非常接近，警官说。

Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.
科尼·凯莱赫从嘴里喷出一股无声的干草汁，同时一只宽大的白色手臂从埃克尔斯街的窗户里扔出一枚硬币。

—What’s the best news? he asked.
——最好的消息是什么？他问。

—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.
——我昨晚看到了那个特别的聚会，警官屏住呼吸说道。


* * * * *

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
一名单腿水手拐过麦康奈尔的街角，绕过拉巴约蒂的冰淇淋车，猛地冲上埃克尔斯街。他对着门口穿着衬衫的拉里·奥罗克，不友善地咆哮道：

—For England …

He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:
他猛烈地向前一晃，越过凯蒂和布迪·迪达勒斯，停下来咆哮道：

J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.
J·J·奥莫洛伊苍白、忧虑的脸被告知兰伯特先生正在仓库里和一位访客在一起。

A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.
一位身材魁梧的女士停下来，从钱包里拿出一枚铜币，扔进递给她的帽子里。水手咕哝着道了谢，酸溜溜地看了一眼无人理睬的窗户，低下头，向前迈出了四步。

He halted and growled angrily:
他停了下来，愤怒地咆哮道：

—For England …
——对于英格兰……

Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.
两个赤脚的顽童在他附近停下来，吮吸着长长的甘草花边，用流着黄色口水的嘴盯着他的残肢。

He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:
他猛地向前一晃，停了下来，抬起头朝窗户低声吼道：

—home and beauty.
——家与美。

The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.
里面欢快甜美的叽叽喳喳的口哨声持续了一两小节，就停止了。百叶窗被拉到一边。一张“不带家具的公寓”卡片从窗框上滑落下来。白色衬裙上衣和绷紧的背带上伸出一只肥硕、裸露、宽大的手臂，闪闪发光。一个女人的手从栏杆上扔出一枚硬币。它落在路上。

One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap, saying:
一个顽童跑过去，把它捡起来，扔进吟游诗人的帽子里，说道：

—There, sir.
——那儿，先生。

Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.
凯蒂和布迪·迪达勒斯推门进了热气腾腾的厨房。

—Did you put in the books? Boody asked.
——你把书放进去了吗？布迪问道。

Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.
靶场里的玛吉用锅棍在冒泡的泡沫下敲击了一团灰色的东西，并擦了擦额头。

Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:
玛吉把水壶里的黄色浓汤倒进碗里。坐在布迪对面的凯蒂轻声说道，她的指尖将随意的面包屑举到嘴边：

—A good job we have that much. Where’s Dilly?

—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.

A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.
一艘小船，一艘皱巴巴的废弃船，以利亚来了，轻轻地沿着利菲河行驶，在卢普莱恩桥下，在桥墩周围的水流中激流，向东航行，经过船体和锚链，在海关旧码头和乔治码头之间。

The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.
桑顿家的金发女孩在柳条篮里铺上了沙沙作响的纤维。布莱兹·博伊兰递给她一个裹着粉色薄纸的瓶子和一个小罐子。

The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.
金发少女纤细的手指数着果实。

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.
布莱兹·博伊兰查看了她衬衫的剪裁。一只年轻的小母鸡。他从高脚杯中取出一朵红色康乃馨。

—This for me? he asked gallantly.
——这是给我的？他殷勤地问道。

The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.
金发女孩斜眼看了他一眼，不管不顾地站了起来，领带有点歪，脸红了。

—Yes, sir, she said.
——是的，先生，她说。

Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.
她狡猾地弯下腰，又想起了肥硕的梨子和红红的桃子。

Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.
布莱兹·博伊兰对她的上衣更加青睐，他微笑的牙齿间夹着红花的花梗。

—May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.
——小姐，我可以对你的电话说句话吗？他调皮地问道。

—Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.
-嘛！阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼说道。

He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.
他越过斯蒂芬的肩膀凝视着戈德史密斯的民意调查。

Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men’s arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.
两车游客缓缓驶过，她们的女人坐在前面，抓着扶手。白脸。男人们的手臂坦率地环绕着他们发育不良的身体。他们从三一学院望向爱尔兰河岸的盲柱门廊，鸽子在那里咕咕叫。

—Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand’ ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. É peccato. Perchè la sua voce … sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.
——阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼说，“Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee”，“quand'ero giovine come Lei”。 Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia。 É peccato。 Perchè la sua voce … sarebbe un cespite di rendita，via。因维斯，雷斯牺牲。

—Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.
——Sacrifizio incruento，史蒂芬微笑着说道，同时轻轻地从中间缓慢地摇晃着他的梣木。

—Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta.
——斯佩里亚莫，留着小胡子的圆脸愉快地说道。妈，dia retta a me。 Ci 里弗塔。

By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.
格拉坦严厉的石头手示意停车，一辆英奇科电车把一群散乱的高地士兵卸下来。

—Ci rifletterò, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.
——Ciriftterò，斯蒂芬说道，低头看了一眼坚固的裤腿。

—Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.
——妈，是的，是吗？阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼说道。

His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.
他沉重的手牢牢地握住了斯蒂芬的手。人类的眼睛。他们好奇地看了一会儿，然后迅速转向一辆达尔基电车。

—Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.
——埃科洛，阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼友好地匆忙说道。 Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi。阿迪奥，卡罗。

—Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.
——到达了，大师，斯蒂芬说道，当他的手被解放时，他举起了帽子。谢谢。

—Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!
——迪彻？阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼说道。斯库西，是吗？美丽的女人！

Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.
阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼 (Almidano Artifoni) 拿着一根卷曲的音乐棒作为信号，穿着粗壮的裤子跟在达尔基电车后面小跑。他徒劳地小跑着，在一群光着膝盖、通过三一大门走私音乐器具的家伙中间徒劳地发出信号。

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.
邓恩小姐把卡佩尔街图书馆的《白衣女人》藏在抽屉深处，然后将一张花哨的信纸卷进打字机。

Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.
这里面有太多神秘的事情。他爱那个人吗，玛丽恩？换一个，再买一个玛丽·塞西尔·海耶的。

The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.
圆盘飞入凹槽，摇晃了一会儿，停下来，凝视着他们：六个。

Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
邓恩小姐敲击键盘：

—16 June 1904.
——1904 年 6 月 16 日。

Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.
五个戴着白帽子的高个子三明治人站在莫尼佩尼的角落和没有沃尔夫·托恩雕像的石板之间，他们猛地转过身来，然后缓慢地往回走。

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She’s not nicelooking, is she? The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.
然后她盯着玛丽·肯德尔这个迷人的红娘子的大幅海报，无精打采地懒洋洋地在笔记本上写着十六和大写的字。芥末色的头发和粉嫩的脸颊。她长得不好看，是吗？她举起裙子的方式。不知道那个家伙今晚会在乐队里吗？如果我能让那个裁缝制作一条像苏西·内格尔那样的风琴裙就好了。他们踢得很盛大。香农和所有游船俱乐部的明星都没有把目光从她身上移开。天哪，他不会把我留在这里直到七点。

The telephone rang rudely by her ear.
电话粗鲁地在她耳边响起。

—Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I’ll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you’re not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I’ll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.
-你好。是的先生。不，先生。是的先生。五点后我会给他们打电话。先生，贝尔法斯特和利物浦只有这两个。好吧，先生。如果你还没有回来的话我可以在六点后走。四分之一后。是的先生。二十七和六。我会告诉他。是的：一、七、六。

She scribbled three figures on an envelope.
她在信封上写下了三个数字。

—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I’ll ring them up after five.
——博伊兰先生！你好！体育界的那位先生正在找你。莱纳汉先生，是的。他说他四点钟会到奥蒙德。不，先生。是的先生。五点后我会给他们打电话。


* * * * *

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.
两张粉红色的脸在小火炬的光芒下转动。

—Who’s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?
-那是谁？内德·兰伯特问道。那是克罗蒂吗？

—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.
——林加贝拉和克罗斯黑文，一个摸索着立足点的声音回答道。

—Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.
—你好，杰克，是你自己吗？内德·兰伯特说道，在闪烁的拱门中举起他柔韧的板条敬礼。快点。注意你的脚步。

The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.
牧师举起手中的灶神像在长长的柔和火焰中燃烧殆尽，然后落下。在他们的脚下，红色的斑点消失了：发霉的空气包围了他们。

—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.
-多么有趣！阴暗中用一种优雅的口音说道。

—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?
——是的，先生，内德·兰伯特衷心地说。我们正站在圣玛丽修道院历史悠久的会议厅里，1534 年，光滑的托马斯在这里宣布自己是叛逆者。这是整个都柏林最具历史意义的地方。奥马登·伯克有一天会写一些关于此事的文章。直到联邦成立之前，爱尔兰的旧银行就在路上，在阿德莱德路上建造犹太教堂之前，原来的犹太教堂也在这里。你以前从没来过这里，杰克，是吗？

—No, Ned.
——不，内德。

—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.
——如果我没记错的话，他骑着马穿过圣母大道，用优雅的口音说道。基尔代尔家族的宅邸位于托马斯宫廷内。

—That’s right, Ned Lambert said. That’s quite right, sir.
——没错，内德·兰伯特说。完全正确，先生。

—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps …
——如果你能这么好心的话，牧师说，下次也许可以让我……

—Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.
——当然，内德·兰伯特说。只要你愿意，就带上相机。我会把窗户上的那些袋子清理掉。您可以从这里或从这里获取它。

In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.
在仍然微弱的灯光下，他走来走去，用板条敲打堆放的种子袋和地板上的有利位置。

From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.
一张长脸上留着胡须，目光悬在棋盘上。

—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won’t trespass on your valuable time …
——兰伯特先生，我非常感激，牧师说。我不会侵犯你的宝贵时间……

—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?
——不客气，先生，内德·兰伯特说。只要你愿意，就随时来吧。下周再说。你知道吗？

—Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.
-是的是的。下午好，兰伯特先生。很高兴认识你。

—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.
——我很高兴，先生，内德·兰伯特回答道。

He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O’Connor, Wexford.
他跟着他的客人来到出口，然后在柱子之间旋转他的板条。他和 J·J·奥莫洛伊一起慢慢走进玛丽修道院，那里的马车夫正在给浮车装载一袋袋角豆和棕榈仁粉，奥康纳，韦克斯福德。

He stood to read the card in his hand.
他站起来看手中的卡片。

—The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael’s, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He’s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He’s well up in history, faith.
——休·C·洛夫牧师，拉斯科菲。现住址：萨林斯圣迈克尔。他是个好年轻人。他告诉我，他正在写一本关于菲茨杰拉德一家的书。相信他的历史很渊博。

The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
年轻女子小心翼翼地从浅色裙子上取下一根紧贴着的树枝。

—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O’Molloy said.
——我以为你在一个新的火药阴谋，J·J·奥莫洛伊说。

Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.
内德·兰伯特在空中打响了手指。

—God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I’m bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn’t like it, though. What? God, I’ll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.
-上帝！他哭了。我忘了告诉他关于基尔代尔伯爵放火烧卡舍尔大教堂后的一件事。你知道那个吗？我非常抱歉我这么做了，他说，但我向上帝宣告，我以为大主教就在里面。但他可能不喜欢这样。什么？天啊，无论如何我都会告诉他。那就是伟大的伯爵菲茨杰拉德·莫尔。他们都是热辣的成员，杰拉尔丁夫妇。

The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
他经过的马匹在松弛的马具下紧张地惊动起来。他拍打着身旁颤抖的花斑臀部，喊道：

—Woa, sonny!
——哇，儿子！

He turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked:
他转向 J. J. O’Molloy 问道：

—Well, Jack. What is it? What’s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.
——嗯，杰克。它是什么？有什么麻烦吗？稍等片刻。用力坚持。

With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.
他张着嘴，头向后仰，一动不动地站着，过了一会儿，大声打了个喷嚏。

—Chow! he said. Blast you!
——周！他说。炸死你！

—The dust from those sacks, J. J. O’Molloy said politely.
——那些麻袋里的灰尘，J.J.奥莫洛伊礼貌地说。

—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a … cold night before … blast your soul … night before last … and there was a hell of a lot of draught …
——不，内德·兰伯特喘着气，我前一天晚上受了……寒冷……让你的灵魂爆炸……前天晚上……还有大量的气流……

He held his handkerchief ready for the coming …
他举起手帕，准备迎接即将到来的……

—I was … Glasnevin this morning … poor little … what do you call him … Chow! … Mother of Moses!
——今天早上我是……格拉斯内文……可怜的小……你叫他什么……Chow！ ……摩西的母亲！


* * * * *

Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.
汤姆·罗奇福德从他紧贴在紫红色背心上的一堆圆盘中取出最上面的一个圆盘。

—See? he said. Say it’s turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.
-看？他说。说是六号了。在这里，看到了。立即打开。

He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.
他将其滑入左侧的插槽中。它冲下凹槽，摇晃了一会儿，停了下来，目光投向他们：六个。

Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.
过去的律师们傲慢地恳求着，看到里奇·古尔丁从综合税务局到尼西·普锐斯法院，手里拿着古尔丁、科利斯和沃德的钱袋，听到从国王法庭的海事部门到上诉法院的沙沙声，一位年长的女性带着假牙难以置信地微笑着，黑色丝绸裙子很夸张。

—See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?
-看？他说。现在看我输入的最后一个是在这里：翻过来。影响。杠杆，看到了吗？

He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.
他向他们展示了右侧上升的圆盘柱。

—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.
——聪明的主意，大鼻子弗林吸着鼻子说。因此，迟到的人可以看到哪些轮次正在进行以及哪些轮次结束。

—See? Tom Rochford said.
-看？汤姆·罗奇福德说道。

He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.
他给自己塞了一个圆盘：看着它射出、摆动、凝视、停止：四。立即打开。

—I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.
——我现在就在奥蒙德见到他，莱尼汉说，并给他试探。一次好的转机值得另一次转机。

—Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.
——做吧，汤姆·罗奇福德说。不耐烦地告诉他我是博伊兰。

—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly. When you two begin
——晚安，麦考伊突然说道。当你们两个开始

Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.
诺西·弗林弯下腰走向控制杆，用鼻子吸了吸鼻子。

—But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.
——但是这里是怎么运作的，汤米？他问。

—Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.
——图拉鲁，莱内汉说。回头见。

He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.
他跟着麦考伊穿过克兰普顿球场的小广场。

—He’s a hero, he said simply.
——他是个英雄，他简单地说。

—I know, M’Coy said. The drain, you mean.
——我知道，麦考伊说。你说的是下水道。

—Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.
-流走？莱内汉说。它在一个沙井下面。

They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.
他们经过丹·洛瑞的音乐厅，迷人的红娘子玛丽·肯德尔在海报上对着他们微笑。

Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.
沿着帝国音乐厅旁边的梧桐街小路走下去，莱内汉向麦考伊展示了整个事情的经过。其中一个沙井就像一根该死的煤气管，可怜的家伙被困在里面，被下水道的气体窒息了。不管怎样，汤姆·罗奇福德还是倒下了，布奇的背心和所有的东西都被绳子缠住了。该死的，他用绳子套住了那个可怜的家伙，两个人都被拉了上来。

—The act of a hero, he said.
——英雄的行为，他说。

At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.
在海豚广场，他们停下来，让救护车从他们身边驶过，驶向杰维斯街。

—This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price. What’s the time by your gold watch and chain?
——这边走，他边说边向右走。我想去 Lynam 看看 Sceptre 的起价。你的金表和金链现在几点了？

M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s clock.
麦考伊看了看马库斯·特蒂乌斯·摩西阴暗的办公室，然后又看了看奥尼尔的钟。

—After three, he said. Who’s riding her?
——三点以后，他说。谁骑着她？

—O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.
——O。麦登，莱内汉说。她是一匹比赛母马。

While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.
当他在圣殿酒吧等待时，麦考伊轻轻地用脚趾从通向排水沟的小路上推开了香蕉皮。在黑暗中紧追不舍的家伙可能很容易摔倒。

The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.
车道的大门大开，为总督的队伍提供了出口。

—Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly. Through here.
——甚至是钱，莱内汉回道。我在那里撞到了班塔姆·莱昂斯，准备去背一匹别人送给他的该死的马，那匹马没有地球人的血统。经过这里。

They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart.
他们走上台阶，来到商人的拱门下。一个黑背人扫视着小贩推车上的书籍。

—There he is, Lenehan said.
——他在那儿，莱内汉说。

—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.
——想知道他要买什么，麦考伊回头看了一眼说道。

—Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.
——利奥波尔多或者说黑麦上的花朵，莱内汉说。

—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.
——麦考伊说，他对销售非常着迷。有一天我和他在一起，他花了两个鲍勃从利菲街的一家旧书店买了一本书。里面有价值双倍的精美盘子、星星、月亮和长尾巴的彗星。这是关于天文学的。

Lenehan laughed.
莱纳汉笑了。

—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said. Come over in the sun.
——我会告诉你一个关于彗星尾巴的好消息，他说。过来晒晒太阳吧

They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.
他们穿过金属桥，沿着河堤边的惠灵顿码头走去。

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.
帕特里克·阿洛伊修斯·迪格纳姆大师从曼根（Mangan）、已故的费伦巴赫（Fehrenbach）的店里出来，手里拿着一磅半的猪排。

—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard …
——格伦克里管教所里有一个很长的摊位，莱尼汉急切地说。一年一度的晚宴，你懂的。煮衬衫事件。瓦尔·狄龙市长也在场，查尔斯·卡梅伦爵士和丹·道森爵士发表了讲话，还有音乐。巴特尔·达西 (Bartell d’Arcy) 演唱，本杰明·多拉德 (Benjamin Dollard) 演唱……

—I know, M’Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.
——我知道，麦考伊插话了。我太太曾经在那儿唱过歌。

—Did she? Lenehan said.
——是吗？莱内汉说。

A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.
一张“不带家具的公寓”卡片重新出现在埃克尔斯街 7 号的窗框上。

He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.
他核对了一下自己的故事，然后突然大笑起来。

—But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies …
——但是等我告诉你，他说。卡姆登街的德拉亨特有餐饮服务，而你的确实是首席洗瓶工。布鲁姆和妻子也在场。我们放了很多东西：波特酒、雪利酒和库拉索岛，我们对它们做了充分的公正处理。这是快速而激烈的。液体之后是固体。大量的冷关节和肉馅饼……

—I know, M’Coy said. The year the missus was there …
——我知道，麦考伊说。那一年，太太在那里……

Lenehan linked his arm warmly.
莱内汉热情地挽着他的手臂。

—But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell’s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.
——但是等我告诉你，他说。在一番热闹之后，我们也吃了一顿午夜午餐，当我们出发时，已经是前一天晚上后的第二天早上的凌晨了。回到家时，毛床山度过了一个美丽的冬夜。布鲁姆和克里斯·卡利南在车的一侧，我和妻子在另一侧。我们开始唱欢乐歌和二重唱：瞧，清晨的曙光。她的腹带下装满了德拉亨特波特酒，已经做好了准备。该死的汽车每一次颠簸，她都会撞到我身上。地狱的乐趣！她有一对很好的，上帝保佑她。像那样。

He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
他将凹陷的双手握在距离自己一肘的地方，皱着眉头：

—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?
——我一直把地毯塞到她身下，给她安放围巾。明白我的意思了吗？

His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
他的双手塑造出充足的空气曲线。他欣喜地闭上眼睛，身体缩了缩，嘴里发出甜甜的叫声。

—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She’s a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.
——无论如何，小伙子站了起来，他叹了口气说道。她是一匹顽皮的母马，这是毫无疑问的。布卢姆正在向克里斯·卡里南和哈维指出天上所有的星星和彗星：大熊、赫拉克勒斯和龙，以及整个京邦。但是，上帝啊，可以说，我在银河系中迷失了。他知道他们所有人，信仰。最后她在一英里外发现了一只小威士。那是什么星星，波尔迪？她说。天哪，她把布鲁姆逼到了绝境。是那个吗？克里斯·卡利南说，当然这只是你所说的针刺。天哪，他的话并没有离谱。

Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.
莱内汉停了下来，靠在河堤上，气喘吁吁，轻笑起来。

—I’m weak, he gasped.
——我很虚弱，他喘着气说。

M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.
麦考伊苍白的脸瞬间微笑起来，然后变得严肃起来。莱纳汉又继续前行。他举起游艇帽，飞快地挠了挠后脑勺。他在阳光下斜眼看了麦考伊一眼。

—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He’s not one of your common or garden … you know … There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.
——他是一位有教养的全能选手，布鲁姆就是，他认真地说。他不是你们的普通人或花园里的人……你知道……老布鲁姆有一种艺术家的气质。


* * * * *

Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle’s Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.
布卢姆先生漫不经心地翻阅了《玛丽亚·蒙克的可怕揭露》和亚里士多德的杰作。印刷品歪歪扭扭。盘子：婴儿在血红色的子宫里抱成一团，就像被宰杀的牛的肝脏一样。此时此刻，全世界有很多人都这样。所有的人都用头骨撞击以摆脱困境。每分钟都有一个孩子在某个地方诞生。普尔弗伊夫人。

He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
他把两本书放在一边，看了第三本：利奥波德·冯·萨赫·马索克的《贫民窟故事》。

—That I had, he said, pushing it by.
——我已经拥有了，他一边说，一边推开它。

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.
店主让两本书落在柜台上。

—Them are two good ones, he said.
——他们是两个好人，他说。

Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.
他的呼吸像洋葱一样从他破损的嘴里喷出，穿过柜台。他弯腰把其他的书捆成一捆，把它们抱在自己解开扣子的背心上，然后把它们搬到肮脏的窗帘后面。

On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.
在奥康奈尔桥上，许多人观察到舞蹈等教授丹尼斯·J·马金尼先生严肃的举止和同性恋的服装。

Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.
布卢姆先生独自看着标题。詹姆斯·洛夫伯奇的《公平暴君》。知道那是一种。有它？是的。

He opened it. Thought so.
他打开了它。也这么觉得。

A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.
肮脏的窗帘后面传来女人的声音。听着：那个男人。

No: she wouldn’t like that much. Got her it once.
不：她不会那么喜欢。给她送过一次。

He read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.
他读到了另一个标题：罪恶的糖果。更多的是她的路线。让我们来看看。

He read where his finger opened.
他读了手指张开的地方。

—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!
——她丈夫给她的所有美钞都在商店里花在了奇妙的礼服和最昂贵的褶边上。为了他！为了拉乌尔！

Yes. This. Here. Try.
是的。这。这里。尝试。

—Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabillé.
——她的嘴唇粘在他的身上，给了他一个甜美性感的吻，而他的手则抚摸着她体内华丽的曲线。

Yes. Take this. The end.
是的。拿着它。结束。

—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.
——你迟到了，他用怀疑的眼神看着她，声音沙哑。美丽的女人脱掉了黑貂色的裹身裙，露出了女王般的肩膀和举起的木尖。当她平静地转向他时，她完美的嘴唇上浮现出难以察觉的微笑。

Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.
布卢姆先生又读了一遍：美丽的女人。

Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for Him! For Raoul!). Armpits’ oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!
温暖轻轻地洒在他身上，让他的肉体感到恐惧。在皱巴巴的衣服中，肉体充分屈服：眼白昏昏欲睡。他的鼻孔拱起，等待着猎物。融化的乳房药膏（为了他！为了拉乌尔！）。腋下的洋葱味汗水。鱼胶史莱姆（她的浮点！）。感觉！按！碎！狮子的硫磺粪便！

Young! Young!
年轻的！年轻的！

An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.
一位年长的女性，不再年轻，离开了大法官法庭、国王法官席、财政法庭和普通上诉法庭，在大法官法庭上听取了海事司的波特顿精神错乱案件的传票，单方面动议，在哈维诉海洋事故和担保公司案中，上诉法院保留了“凯恩斯夫人”号船东与莫娜号三桅帆船船东的判决。

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
浓痰的咳嗽声震动了书店的空气，把肮脏的窗帘鼓了起来。店主露出了未梳的灰色脑袋和未刮胡子的红脸，咳嗽着。他粗鲁地耙着喉咙，把痰吐在地板上。他把靴子放在他吐过口水的地方，沿着靴子擦拭脚掌，然后弯下腰，露出一顶剥皮的王冠，头发稀少。

Mr Bloom beheld it.
布卢姆先生看到了。

Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
他控制住自己的呼吸困难，说道：

—I’ll take this one.
——我要这个。

The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.
店主抬起了因陈旧大黄而变得模糊的双眼。

—Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That’s a good one.
——罪恶的糖果，他一边说，一边敲击着它。这是一件好事。

The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.
狄龙拍卖行门口的漆匠又摇了两下手铃，在柜子里用粉笔画的镜子里看了看自己。

Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.
迪莉·迪达勒斯在路边闲逛，听到铃声和里面拍卖师的叫喊声。四和九。那些可爱的窗帘。五先令。舒适的窗帘。新品售价两几尼。有预付五先令的吗？去买五先令。

The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
漆匠举起手铃，摇了摇：

—Barang!
——巴朗！

Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.
最后一圈的铃声响起，激励半英里车手全力冲刺。 J.A.杰克逊、W.E.怀利、A.芒罗和H.T.加汉伸长脖子摇晃着穿过学院图书馆的弯道。

Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row. He halted near his daughter.
迪达勒斯先生拖着长长的小胡子，从威廉姆斯的座位上站了出来。他在女儿身边停了下来。

—It’s time for you, she said.
——你的时间到了，她说。

—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!
——为了主耶稣的爱，站直吧，迪达勒斯先生说。你是否想模仿你吹短号的叔叔约翰？忧郁的上帝啊！

Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.
迪莉耸耸肩。迪达勒斯先生把手放在他们身上，然后将他们拉了回来。

—Stand up straight, girl, he said. You’ll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?
——站直，女孩，他说。你会发现脊柱弯曲。你知道自己长什么样吗？

He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.
他突然低下头，向前倾，耸起肩膀，垂下下颌。

—Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
——放弃吧，父亲，迪丽说。所有的人都在看着你。

Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.
迪达勒斯先生直起身子，再次拉扯他的小胡子。

—Did you get any money? Dilly asked.
——你拿到钱了吗？迪莉问道。

—Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.
——我到哪里去弄钱呢？迪达勒斯先生说道。都柏林没有人愿意借给我四便士。

—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.
——你有一些，迪莉看着他的眼睛说。

—How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.
-你怎么知道？迪达勒斯先生舌头抵在脸颊上问道。

Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street.
克南先生对自己预订的订单很满意，大胆地沿着詹姆斯的街道行走。

—I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?
——我知道你做到了，迪莉回答。你现在在苏格兰房子里吗？

—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.
——那么，我不是，迪达勒斯先生微笑着说。是小尼姑教你这么调皮的吗？这里。

He handed her a shilling.
他递给她一先令。

—See if you can do anything with that, he said.
——看看你能不能用它做点什么，他说。

—I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.
——我想你有五个，迪莉说。给我更多。

—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You’re like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you. Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff. He’s dead. The man upstairs is dead.
——等一下，迪达勒斯先生威胁地说。你和其他人一样，是吗？自从你可怜的母亲去世后，一群无礼的小母狗。但请稍等一下。你们都会受到我的冷遇和漫长的一天。低黑心！我要摆脱你了。我不在乎我是否被拉得僵硬。他死了。楼上的人已经死了。

He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.
他离开了她，继续前行。迪丽连忙跟上，拉起他的外套。

—Well, what is it? he said, stopping.
——呃，那是什么？他停下来说道。

The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.
侍从在他们背后按响了门铃。

—Barang!
——巴朗！

—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.
——诅咒你那该死的明目张胆的灵魂，迪达勒斯先生转身对着他喊道。

The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:
侍从意识到了自己的评论，于是无力地摇晃着摇铃：

—Bang!
-砰！

Mr Dedalus stared at him.
迪达勒斯先生盯着他。

—Watch him, he said. It’s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.
——看着他，他说。这是有启发性的。我想知道他会允许我们说话吗？

—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.
——你得到的远不止这些，父亲，迪莉说。

—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there’s all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.
——我要给你演示一个小技巧，迪达勒斯先生说。我会把你们留在耶稣离开犹太人的地方。你看，这就是我所有的了。我从杰克·鲍尔那里得到了两先令，并花了两便士为葬礼刮胡子。

He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.
他紧张地掏出一把铜币。

—Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.
——你就不能到处找点钱吗？迪莉说。

Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.
迪达勒斯先生想了想，点了点头。

—I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street. I’ll try this one now.
——我会的，他严肃地说。我沿着奥康奈尔街的排水沟看了看。我现在就试试这个。

—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.
——你很有趣，迪莉笑着说道。

—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I’ll be home shortly.
——给，迪达勒斯先生递给她两便士说道。给自己买一杯牛奶和一个小面包什么的。我很快就会回家。

He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.
他把其他硬币放进口袋，然后继续往前走。

The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.
总督的队伍在谄媚的警察的迎接下走出帕克盖特。

—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.
——我确信你还有一先令，迪莉说。

The lacquey banged loudly.
漆器发出巨响。

Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:
迪达勒斯先生在一片喧闹声中走开了，他抿着嘴，装腔作势地轻轻地自言自语道：

—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!
——小修女们！不错的小东西！噢，他们当然不会做任何事！哦，当然他们不会真的！是莫妮卡妹妹吗！

From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street, past Shackleton’s offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we’re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that … Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.
克南先生从日晷朝詹姆斯家门口走去，他对自己为普尔布鲁克·罗伯逊预订的订单很满意，他大胆地沿着詹姆斯家的街道，经过沙克尔顿的办公室。没事就围着他转。你好吗，克里明斯先生？第一流，先生。我担心您可能在皮姆利科的另一家酒店。事情进行得如何？只要活着就好。我们的天气真好。确实是的。对国家有好处。那些农民总是牢骚满腹。我就喝一点你最好的杜松子酒，克里明斯先生。一杯小杜松子酒，先​​生。是的先生。斯洛克姆将军爆炸的可怕事件。可怕，可怕！伤亡一千人。还有令人心碎的场景。男人践踏女人和孩子。最残酷的事情。他们说原因是什么？自燃。最可耻的揭露。没有一艘救生艇能够漂浮，消防水带全部爆裂。我不明白的是，检查员怎么会允许这样的船……现在，你说得对，克里明斯先生。你知道为什么？棕榈油。这是事实吗？毫无疑问。好吧，现在看看那个。他们说美国是自由之地。我以为我们这里很糟糕。

I smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn’t that true? That’s a fact.
我对他微笑。美国，我轻声说道，就这样。它是什么？对每个国家的扫荡，包括我们自己的国家。这不是真的吗？这是事实。

Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up.
移植，我亲爱的先生。嗯，当然，有钱去的地方总会有人接手。

Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.
看见他在看我的礼服。连衣裙就可以做到。没有什么比衣冠楚楚的外表更重要的了。把他们打翻了。

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
——你好，西蒙，考利神父说。最近怎么样？

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
——你好，鲍勃，老人，迪达勒斯先生停下来回答。

Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.
克南先生停下来，在美发师彼得·肯尼迪的倾斜镜子前梳理自己。时尚外套，毫无疑问。道森街的斯科特。我为它付出了半个主权，非常值得。从未建造过低于三基尼的建筑。让我贴在地上。基尔代尔街头俱乐部的一些官员可能有过这种经历。约翰·穆里根，希伯尼安银行的经理，昨天在卡莱尔桥上用锐利的目光注视着我，好像他还记得我一样。

Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.
啊哈姆！必须为那些家伙打扮角色。骑士之路。绅士。现在，克里明斯先生，先生，愿我们再次荣幸地享受您的定制服务。正如古语所说，一杯令人振奋但不令人陶醉的杯子。

North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.
北墙和约翰·罗杰森爵士的码头，带着船体和锚链，向西航行，乘着一艘小船，一艘皱巴巴的废弃船，在渡轮上摇晃，以利亚来了。

Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He’s as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.
克南先生告别地看了一眼他的照片。当然是高颜值啦花白的小胡子。归来的印度军官。他勇敢地用他那矮胖的身体向前迈进，挺起肩膀。山姆，那边是内德·兰伯特的兄弟吗？什么？是的。他就像该死的那样。不，那辆汽车的挡风玻璃在阳光下。就这样一闪而过。真他妈像他。

Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.
啊哈姆！杜松汁的热酒温暖了他的生命体和呼吸。确实是一滴好杜松子酒。他的燕尾服在明亮的阳光下闪烁着，在他那肥胖的趾高气昂的身躯上闪闪发光。

Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife drove by in her noddy.
在那里，埃米特被绞死、抽出并分尸。油腻的黑色绳子。当中尉的妻子开着她的点头车经过时，狗正在舔街上的血。

Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.
那是一段糟糕的时光。好吧。结束了。也很棒。四瓶男人。

Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan’s? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.
让我看看。他被埋葬在圣米尚教堂吗？或者不，格拉斯内文有一场午夜葬礼。尸体通过墙上的暗门被带进来。迪格纳姆现在就在那里。一气之下就出去了。好吧。最好在这里拒绝。绕道而行。

Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.
克南先生转身沿着吉尼斯游客候诊室拐角处的沃特林街斜坡走下去。都柏林酿酒公司的商店外面停着一辆没有票价或杂货的汽车，缰绳系在方向盘上。该死的危险的东西。一些蒂珀雷里码头危及公民的生命。逃跑的马。

Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.
丹尼斯·布林带着他的大部头著作，厌倦了在约翰·亨利·门顿的办公室里等了一个小时，带着他的妻子穿过奥康奈尔桥，前往科利斯和沃德先生的办公室。

Mr Kernan approached Island street.
克南先生走近岛街。

Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly’s. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.
烦恼之时。必须请内德·兰伯特借给我乔纳·巴林顿爵士的回忆。当你现在以一种回顾性的方式回顾这一切时。在戴利家玩游戏。那就不用打牌了。其中一个人的手被匕首钉在桌子上。爱德华·菲茨杰拉德勋爵在这里的某个地方逃离了爵士少校。莫伊拉房子后面的马厩。

Damn good gin that was.
那是该死的好杜松子酒。

Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.
风度翩翩的年轻贵族。当然是好货。那个戴着紫罗兰色手套的恶棍、那个假乡绅出卖了他。当然，他们站在错误的一边。他们在黑暗邪恶的日子里奋起。好诗就是：英格拉姆。他们是绅士。本·多拉德确实把这首民谣唱得感人至深。精湛的演绎。

At the siege of Ross did my father fall.
在罗斯围攻中，我父亲阵亡了。

A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.
一队人沿着彭布罗克码头轻松地小跑过去，骑手们在马鞍上跳跃着。礼服。奶油色遮阳伞。

Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.
克南先生急忙向前走去，吹着小风。

His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!
阁下！太糟糕了！就差一点点就错过了。该死的！真可惜！

Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.
史蒂芬·迪达勒斯透过带蹼的窗户看着宝石匠的手指证明了一条因时间而变得迟钝的链条。窗户和陈列柜上布满了灰尘。灰尘使辛劳的手指和秃鹫的指甲变黑了。灰尘沉睡在青铜和银的暗淡线圈上、朱砂菱形上、红宝石上、麻风石和酒色宝石上。

Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.
诞生于黑暗的蠕虫大地，冰冷的火点，邪恶，黑暗中闪烁的光芒。堕落的大天使们把眉毛上的星星抛在那里。泥泞的猪鼻子，手，根又根，牢牢地抓住它们。

She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.
她在口香糖和大蒜一起燃烧的阴暗气氛中跳舞。一名留着锈胡子的水手喝着烧杯朗姆酒，看着她。一条长长的、无声无息的车辙。她跳舞，跳跃，摇动她那母猪般的腰部和臀部，在她粗糙的肚子上拍打着一颗红宝石蛋。

Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.
老拉塞尔用一块脏兮兮的抹布再次擦亮了他的宝石，转动它，把它放在摩西胡子的尖端。猿爷爷对被盗的宝藏幸灾乐祸。

And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.
而你呢，是从埋葬的土地上夺取古老图像的人吗？诡辩家的伤脑筋的话：安提斯泰尼。毒品的传说。东方不朽的小麦，万古长存。

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.
两位刚闻完咸味的老妇人沿着伦敦桥路艰难地穿过爱尔兰镇，其中一位撑着一把磨满了沙子的破旧雨伞，一位则提着助产士的袋子，里面滚着十一只鸟蛤。

The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.
皮革带拍打的呼呼声和发电机发出的嗡嗡声敦促斯蒂芬继续工作。无有众生。停止！没有你的时候总是会感到悸动，而内心却总是会感到悸动。你的心，你歌唱。我在他们之间。在哪里？在两个咆哮的世界之间，他们旋转，我。粉碎他们，一个和两个。但我自己也被这一击击晕了。谁能粉碎我？妓女和屠夫就是这两个词。我说！还没有一段时间。环顾四周。

Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, ‘twas so, indeed.
是的，确实如此。非常大而且很棒并且保持了著名的时间。你说得对，先生。周一早上，确实如此。

Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey’s window a faded 186O print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes’ hearts.
史蒂芬沿着贝德福德排走下去，梣木的手柄敲击着他的肩胛骨，发出嘎嘎声。在克洛希西的橱窗里，一幅褪色的 186O 幅希南拳击赛耶斯的印刷品引起了他的注意。戴着方帽的支持者盯着绳索围着。裹着紧身腰带的重量级人物互相轻轻地伸出了球状的拳头。他们在跳动：英雄的心。

He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.
他转身停在倾斜的书车旁。

—Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.
——一个两块钱，小贩说。四块六便士。

Tattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curé of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.
破烂的书页。爱尔兰养蜂人。阿尔斯神父的一生和奇迹。基拉尼袖珍指南。

I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.
我可能会在这里找到我典当的学校奖品之一。 Stephano Dedalo，最佳校友，palmam ferenti。

Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.
康米神父读完晚祷后，一边低声做晚祷，一边走过唐尼卡尼的小村庄。

Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman’s love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:
可能绑定得太好了。这是什么？摩西书第八和第九本书。所有秘密中的秘密。大卫王的印章。翻阅的页面：读啊读。谁比我先经过这里？如何软化干裂的手。白葡萄酒醋的配方。如何赢得女人的爱。对我来说这个。双手合十念诵以下咒语三遍：

—Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.
——Se el yilo 内布拉卡达女性！爱我一个人！圣哉！阿门。

Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot’s charms, as mumbling Joachim’s. Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your wool.
这是谁写的？最受祝福的方丈彼得萨兰卡向所有真正的信徒透露了咒语和祈祷。与其他方丈的魅力一样好，就像约阿希姆的咕哝一样。下来，秃头，否则我们就剥你的毛。

—What are you doing here, Stephen?
——你在这里做什么，斯蒂芬？

Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.
迪莉的高肩膀和破旧的衣服。

Shut the book quick. Don’t let see.
赶紧合上书本。别让看到。

—What are you doing? Stephen said.
-你在干什么？斯蒂芬说。

A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token. Nebrakada femininum.
一张斯图亚特风格的查尔斯面孔，长发垂落在两侧。当她穿着破靴子蹲下生火时，它闪闪发光。我告诉她巴黎的事。晚间，她躺在旧大衣的被子下，抚摸着丹·凯利的象征物——平贝克手镯。内布拉卡达女性。

—What have you there? Stephen asked.
——你那里有什么？史蒂芬问。

—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?
——我从另一辆推车上花了一便士买的，迪丽紧张地笑道。有什么好处吗？

My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.
他们说她有我的眼睛。别人也这么看我吗？快、远、大胆。我心中的阴影。

He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal’s French primer.
他从她手里接过那本无封面的书。查德纳尔的法语入门书。

—What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?
——你买那个干什么？他问。学习法语？

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
她点点头，红着脸，紧紧闭上了嘴唇。

Show no surprise. Quite natural.
没有表现出惊讶。很自然。

—Here, Stephen said. It’s all right. Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.
——在这里，史蒂芬说。没关系。 Mind Maggy 不会把它典当给你。我想我所有的书都不见了。

—Some, Dilly said. We had to.
——有一些，迪莉说。我们不得不。

She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.
她快淹死了。阿根比特。救救她。阿根比特。一切都反对我们。她会用她的眼睛和头发淹没我。一缕缕海藻的头发围绕着我、我的心、我的灵魂。盐绿死亡。

We.
我们。

Agenbite of inwit. Inwit’s agenbite.
因威特的阿根比特。因威特的阿根比特。

Misery! Misery!
苦难！苦难！

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
——你好，西蒙，考利神父说。最近怎么样？

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
——你好，鲍勃，老人，迪达勒斯先生停下来回答。

They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
他们在雷迪和女儿家外面大声地握着手。考利神父经常用勺子的手向下梳理他的胡子。

—What’s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.
——最好的消息是什么？迪达勒斯先生说道。

—Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I’m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
——那为什么不多呢，考利神父说。西蒙，我被封锁了，两个男人在房子周围徘徊，试图进入。

—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?
——真高兴，迪达勒斯先生说。是谁？

—O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
——哦，考利神父说。我们认识的一个贡宾人。

—With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.
——背部骨折了，是吗？迪达勒斯先生问道。

—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard. He’s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
——同样的，西蒙，考利神父回答道。鲁本之流。我只是在等本·多拉德。他要对长约翰说一句话，让他把那两个人带走。我想要的只是一点时间。

He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.
他带着模糊的希望在码头上来回看了看，脖子上鼓着一个大苹果。

—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!
——我知道，迪达勒斯先生点点头说道。可怜的老笨蛋本！他总是为某人做好事。坚持住！

He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
他戴上眼镜，瞬间看向了金属桥。

—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
——天哪，他说，屁股和口袋。

Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
本·多拉德 (Ben Dollard) 戴着宽松的蓝色短款帽子，戴着大斜坡上方的方形帽子，从金属桥上迈着整齐的步态穿过码头。他慢悠悠地朝他们走来，用力地抓着燕尾服后面的东西。

As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
当他走近时，迪达勒斯先生打招呼：

—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
——抓住那个裤子破烂的家伙。

—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
——现在抓住他，本·多拉德说。

Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:
迪达勒斯先生冷漠地、蔑视地打量着本·多拉德身材的各个部位。然后，他转向考利神父点点头，冷笑着嘀咕道：

—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?
——这件衣服很漂亮，适合夏天穿，不是吗？

—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
——哎呀，上帝永远诅咒你的灵魂，本·多拉德愤怒地咆哮道，我这辈子扔掉的衣服比你见过的还要多。

He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
他站在他们旁边，笑容满面，首先是他们，然后是他宽大的衣服，德达勒斯先生从衣服上弹起绒毛，说道：

—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
——无论如何，它们是为一个健康的人而设计的，本。

—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet.
——制造它们的犹太人运气不好，本·多拉德说。感谢上帝，他还没有得到报酬。

—And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.
——本杰明，深低音怎么样？考利神父问道。

Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.
卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔目光呆滞，低声说道，大步走过基尔代尔街头俱乐部。

Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note.
本·多拉德皱起眉头，突然张开嘴，发出低沉的声音。

—Aw! he said.
——啊！他说。

—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
——这就是风格，迪达勒斯先生一边说，一边向无人机点点头。

—What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?
-那个怎么样？本·多拉德说道。灰尘不是太多吗？什么？

He turned to both.
他转向两人。

—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
——那就行了，考利神父说，也点了点头。

The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.
休·C·洛夫牧师从圣玛丽修道院的旧礼拜堂出发，经过詹姆斯和查尔斯·肯尼迪的礼拜堂，在高大风度的杰拉尔丁的陪同下，朝跨栏浅滩的托塞尔走去。

Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.
本·多拉德（Ben Dollard）带着一张沉重的单子走向店面，带领着他们向前走，他快乐的手指高高地举在空中。

—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He’s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t … Wait awhile … We’re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.
——跟我一起去副警长办公室吧，他说。我想向您展示洛克对于法警的新美。他是洛本古拉（Lobengula）和林奇豪恩（Lynchehaun）的杂交品种。请注意，他非常值得一看。一起来。我刚才在酒窖里偶然看到了约翰·亨利·门顿，如果我不这么做的话，我就会摔倒……等一下……我们走对了，鲍勃，相信我。

—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
——几天告诉他，考利神父焦急地说。

Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
本·多拉德停下来，凝视着，他的响亮的孔打开了，当他擦去堵塞他眼睛的沉重的沙姆时，他外套上的一颗悬垂的纽扣从线中晃动起来。

—What few days? he boomed. Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?
——几天了？他大声说道。你的房东没有扣押租金吗？

—He has, Father Cowley said.
——他做到了，考利神父说。

—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?
——那么我们朋友的令状就不值打印它的纸了，本·多拉德说。房东有优先权。我给了他所有的细节。温莎大道29号。爱是名字吗？

—That’s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He’s a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?
——没错，考利神父说。尊敬的爱先生。他是某个国家的部长。但你确定吗？

—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.
——你可以从我这里告诉巴拉巴斯，本·多拉德说，他可以把令状放在杰克放坚果的地方。

He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.
他带着考利神父大胆地向前走，与他的大块头相连。

—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.
——我相信是榛树，迪达勒斯先生一边说，一边把眼镜放在衣襟上，跟在它们后面。


* * * * *

—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.
——这个年轻人会没事的，当他们走出城堡庭院大门时，马丁·坎宁安说道。

The policeman touched his forehead.
警察摸了摸额头。

—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.
——上帝保佑你，马丁·坎宁安高兴地说。

He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.
他向等待的贾维打了个招呼，贾维猛地一甩缰绳，朝爱德华勋爵街走去。

Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.
青铜与金色，肯尼迪小姐的头像与杜斯小姐的头像，出现在奥蒙德酒店的百叶窗上方。

—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.
——是的，马丁·坎宁安一边说，一边摸着自己的胡子。我写信给康米神父，把整个案子摆在他面前。

—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.
——你可以试试我们的朋友，鲍尔先生向后建议道。

—Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.
——博伊德？马丁·坎宁安简短地说。别碰我。

John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.
约翰·怀斯·诺兰（John Wyse Nolan）落在后面，一边读着名单，一边快速地跟随他们下了科克山。

On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.
在市政厅的台阶上，南内蒂议员下楼，向市议员考利和上楼的议员亚伯拉罕·里昂致意。

The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.
城堡车空空驶入上交易街。

—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
——看这里，马丁，约翰·怀斯·诺兰在邮局追上他们时说道。我看到布卢姆以五先令的价格把他的名字写下来。

—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.
——完全正确，马丁·坎宁安接过名单说道。也放下了五先令。

—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
——鲍尔先生也没有再说什么。

—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
——奇怪但真实，马丁·坎宁安补充道。

John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.
约翰·怀斯·诺兰睁大了眼睛。

—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.
——我想说，犹太人非常善良，他优雅地引用道。

They went down Parliament street.
他们沿着议会街走去。

—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.
——鲍尔先生说，吉米·亨利正在前往卡瓦纳家。

—Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.
——没错，马丁·坎宁安说。开始。

Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.
在克莱尔宅邸外，博伊兰伏击了杰克·穆尼的姐夫，他身材魁梧，身材紧绷，正试图寻求自由。

John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.
约翰·怀斯·诺兰（John Wyse Nolan）和《权力先生》一起向后退去，而马丁·坎宁安（Martin Cunningham）抓住了一个穿着冰雹服、衣冠楚楚的小个子男人的肘部，他脚步不稳，脚步匆忙地经过米奇·安德森（Micky Anderson）的手表。

—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.
——约翰·怀斯·诺兰告诉鲍尔先生，助理镇书记员的鸡眼给他带来了一些麻烦。

They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.
他们拐过拐角，朝詹姆斯·卡瓦纳的酒窖走去。空荡荡的城堡车厢停在埃塞克斯门前，停在他们前面。马丁·坎宁安总是说话，经常展示吉米·亨利没有看一眼的清单。

—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.
——约翰·怀斯·诺兰说，约翰·范宁也在这里，就像生命一样重要。

The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
约翰·范宁高大的身躯占据了他所站的门口。

—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.
——美好的一天，副警长先生，马丁·坎宁安说，所有人都停下来打招呼。

Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.
长约翰范宁没有给他们让路。他果断地移开了亨利·克莱的大眼睛，他那双凶猛的大眼睛聪明地皱起眉头，扫过所有人的脸。

—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
——应征入伍的父亲们正在进行和平协商吗？他用尖刻的语气对助理镇书记员说道。

Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.
吉米·亨利对他们那该死的爱尔兰语脾气暴躁地说，地狱向他们的基督徒敞开了。他想知道负责维持议事厅秩序的元帅在哪里。老巴洛（老巴洛）这位殓刑者因哮喘病躺在床上，桌子上没有狼牙棒，一切秩序井然，甚至没有法定人数，哈钦森（Hutchinson），市长大人，在兰迪德诺（Llandudno），小洛肯·夏洛克（Lorcan Sherlock）为他代理。该死的爱尔兰语，我们祖先的语言。

Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.
高个子约翰·范宁从嘴里吐出一缕烟雾。

Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.
马丁·坎宁安一边捻着胡子，一边对镇书记助理和副警长轮流讲话，而约翰·怀斯·诺兰则保持沉默。

—What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.
——那是什么迪格纳姆？约翰·范宁长时间问道。

Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
吉米·亨利做了个鬼脸，抬起了左脚。

—O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!
——噢，我的鸡眼！他哀怨地说。老天爷，上楼来吧，等我找个地方坐下来。呃！噢！头脑！

Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs.
他急躁地在约翰·范宁长长的侧翼旁边给自己腾出了地方，然后走进楼梯。

—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.
——上来吧，马丁·坎宁安对副警长说。我认为你不认识他，或者也许你认识他。

With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
鲍尔先生和约翰·怀斯·诺兰一起跟随他们进来。

—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.
——他是一个正派的小灵魂，鲍尔先生对着高大的约翰·范宁坚定的背影说道，并朝镜子里高大的约翰·范宁走去。

—Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.
——尺寸相当小。马丁·坎宁安说，那是芒顿办公室的迪格纳姆。

Long John Fanning could not remember him.
长约翰·范宁不记得他了。

Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
空中传来马蹄声。

—What’s that? Martin Cunningham said.
-那是什么？马丁·坎宁安说道。

All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.
所有人都转向原地。约翰·怀斯·诺兰又下来了。从门口凉爽的阴影中，他看到马匹穿过议会街，挽具和光滑的脚腕在阳光下闪闪发光。他们快活地从他那冷漠、不友善的眼睛前走过，速度不快。坐在领导者的马鞍上，跳跃的领导者，骑着前行者。

—What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.
-它以前如何？当他们上楼梯时，马丁·坎宁安问道。

—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.
——爱尔兰中将兼总督约翰·怀斯·诺兰在楼梯脚下回答。


* * * * *

As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:
当他们踏上厚厚的地毯时，巴克·穆里根在他的巴拿马车后面对海恩斯低声说道：

—Parnell’s brother. There in the corner.
——帕内尔的兄弟。就在角落里。

They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
他们选了一张靠窗的小桌子，对面是一个长脸男人，他的胡子和目光专注地垂在棋盘上。

—Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
——是他吗？海恩斯在座位上转过身问道。

—Yes, Mulligan said. That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
——是的，穆里根说。那是约翰·霍华德，他的兄弟，我们的市元帅。

John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.
约翰·霍华德·帕内尔静静地翻译了一位白人主教，他的灰色爪子再次举到了他的前额上。片刻之后，在屏幕下，他的眼睛迅速地、幽灵般地明亮地看着他的敌人，然后再次落在一个正在工作的角落上。

—I’ll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress.
——我要一杯混合咖啡，海恩斯对女服务员说。

—Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.
——两种混合物，巴克·穆里根说。给我们带来一些烤饼、黄油和一些蛋糕。

When she had gone he said, laughing:
当她走后，他笑着说道：

—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.
——我们称之为 D.B.C.因为他们的蛋糕实在是太糟糕了。噢，但你错过了《哈姆雷特》中的德达勒斯。

Haines opened his newbought book.
海恩斯打开了他新买的书。

—I’m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.
——对不起，他说。莎士比亚是所有失去平衡的心灵的快乐狩猎场。

The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
独腿水手对着尼尔森街14号一带咆哮道：

—England expects …
——英格兰期望……

Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
巴克·穆里根的樱草色背心随着他的笑声欢快地颤抖着。

—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.
——当他的身体失去平衡时，他说，你应该看看他。我称他为流浪的安格斯。

—I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
——我确信他有固定的想法，海恩斯说道，若有所思地用拇指和食指捏着下巴。现在我正在猜测它可能会是什么。这样的人总是有的。

Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
巴克·穆里根严肃地弯过桌子。

—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation …
——他说，地狱的幻象让他失去了理智。他永远无法捕捉到阁楼笔记。在所有诗人中，斯温伯恩的音符是白色的死亡和红色的诞生。这就是他的悲剧。他永远成不了诗人。创造的乐趣……

—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.
——永恒的惩罚，海恩斯简短地点点头说道。我懂了。今天早上我凭着信念对付了他。我看出他心里有事。这很有趣，因为维也纳的波科尔尼教授提出了一个有趣的观点。

Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.
巴克·穆里根警惕的目光看到女服务员走过来。他帮她卸下托盘。

—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?
——他在古老的爱尔兰神话中找不到地狱的踪迹，海恩斯在欢快的杯子里说道。似乎缺乏道德观念、命运感、报应感。奇怪的是他竟然有这个固定的想法。他为你们的运动写过什么吗？

He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
他熟练地将两块糖纵向浸入生奶油中。巴克·穆里根将一个热气腾腾的烤饼切成两半，并在冒烟的烤饼上涂上黄油。他饥肠辘辘地咬下了一块柔软的东西。

—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.
——十年，他边嚼边笑说。十年后他要写一些东西。

—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.
——看来还很遥远，海恩斯若有所思地举起勺子说道。不过，我不应该怀疑他是否真的这么做了。

He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
他从杯子里的奶油锥体中舀了一勺。

—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don’t want to be imposed on.
——这是真正的爱尔兰奶油，我接受了，他克制地说。我不想被强加。

Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.
伊利亚号，一艘轻质、皱巴巴的一次性小船，在船只和拖网渔船的侧翼中向东航行，在软木群岛中，越过新沃平街，经过本森的渡口，并乘着来自布里奇沃特的三桅纵帆船罗斯文用砖块向东航行。

Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.
阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼走过霍尔斯街，经过休厄尔的院子。在他身后，卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔挂着雨伞风衣，避开了劳·史密斯先生家前的路灯，沿着梅林广场穿过马路。在他身后远处，一个失明的小伙子沿着大学公园的围墙轻轻敲着路。

Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔一直走到刘易斯·沃纳先生欢快的窗户前，然后转身沿着梅林广场大步走回来，他的雨伞风衣晃来晃去。

At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:
在王尔德家的拐角处，他停了下来，皱着眉头看着大都会大厅上宣布的伊利亚的名字，皱着眉头看着远处公爵的草坪。他的眼镜在阳光下皱着眉头闪闪发亮。他露出鼠牙，低声说道：

—Coactus volui.
——Coactus volui。

He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.
他大步朝克莱尔街走去，嘴里念叨着凶狠的话语。

As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.
当他大步走过布卢姆先生的牙科窗户时，风衣的晃动粗鲁地从角度上擦过一根细长的敲打手杖，然后向前扫去，撞到了毫无生气的身体。盲目的小伙子随着大步走的身影转过病态的脸。

—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!
——上帝诅咒你，他酸溜溜地说，不管你是谁！你个瞎子，我也不瞎，你个混蛋！


* * * * *

Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.
拉吉·奥多诺霍的主人帕特里克·阿洛伊修斯·迪格纳姆对面，他抓着一磅半的曼根的、已故的费伦巴赫的猪排，沿着温暖的威克洛街道闲逛。斯托尔太太、奎格利太太和麦克道威尔太太坐在客厅里，实在是太无聊了，拉着百叶窗，他们都抽着鼻子，喝着巴尼叔叔从汤尼店带来的上等茶色雪利酒。他们吃着乡村水果蛋糕的碎屑，咀嚼着整个花开的时光，叹息着。

After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That’s me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.
经过威克洛巷后，宫廷女帽设计师道尔夫人的橱窗拦住了他。他站在那儿，看着那两个剥光了皮毛、支起道具的家伙。从侧镜中，两位哀悼的迪格纳姆大师默默地张着嘴。都柏林的宠物小羊迈勒·基奥 (Myler Keogh) 将与波托贝洛 (Portobello) 打手贝内特 (Bennett) 军士长会面，争夺五十英镑的钱包。天啊，那真是一场值得一看的冰球比赛。迈勒·基奥，就是那个戴着绿色腰带向他打架的家伙。两个酒吧入口，士兵半价。我可以轻松地在妈妈身上做铺位。他左边的迪格纳姆大师也跟着他转身。那是我在哀悼。什么时候？五月二十二。当然，盛开的事情已经结束了。他向右转，迪格纳姆少爷也在他的右边转过身来，他的帽子歪了，领子竖起来。扣上纽扣，扬起下巴，他看到玛丽·肯德尔（Marie Kendall）的形象，迷人的女红，就在两个皱褶旁边。斯托尔抽的烟包里确实有这样的一句名言，他的老伙计有一次发现了他，狠狠地骂了他一顿。

Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.
迪格纳姆大师放下衣领，继续磨磨蹭蹭。菲茨西蒙斯（Fitzsimons）是最需要力量的皱眉者。那个家伙的一记冰球就能把你打到下周中旬，伙计。但科学界最出色的人是杰姆·科贝特（Jem Corbet），后来菲茨西蒙斯（Fitzsimons）躲开了他，把他打得精疲力尽。

In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.
在格拉夫顿街，迪格纳姆少爷看到一个纨绔子弟嘴里叼着一朵红花，他身上被踢了两脚，他听着醉汉对他说的话，一直咧着嘴笑。

No Sandymount tram.
没有桑迪蒙特电车。

Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight. Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name.
迪格纳姆大师沿着拿骚街走着，把猪排移到了另一只手上。他的衣领又弹了起来，他把它拉了下来。花朵饰钉对于衬衫的扣眼来说太小，花朵末端。他遇到了背着书包的男生。我明天也不去，待到周一。他遇到了其他男生。他们注意到我在哀悼吗？巴尼叔叔说他今晚会把它登在报纸上。然后他们都会在报纸上看到它并读到我的名字和爸爸的名字。

His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.
他的脸不再是红色，而是变成了灰色，有一只苍蝇从上面爬到了他的眼睛处。他们将螺丝拧入棺材时发出的嘎吱声，以及将棺材搬下楼时发出的颠簸声。

Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.
爸爸在里面，妈妈在客厅里哭，巴尼叔叔告诉男人们如何绕过拐角。那是一口大棺材，又高又重。怎么样？昨晚，爸爸被嘘了，他站在楼梯平台上，大声喊着要穿靴子，要出去到汤尼那里喝更多的嘘声，他穿着衬衫，看起来又胖又矮。再也见不到他了。死亡，就是这样。爸爸死了。我父亲死了。他告诉我要做妈妈的好儿子。我听不到他说的其他话，但我看到他的舌头和牙齿试图更好地表达。可怜的爸爸。那是迪格纳姆先生，我的父亲。我希望他现在在炼狱里，因为他周六晚上去向康罗伊神父忏悔。

William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.
达德利伯爵威廉·汉布尔和达德利夫人在赫塞尔廷中校的陪同下，午饭后驱车从总督府出发。接下来的车厢里坐着尊贵的佩吉特夫人、德·库尔西小姐和尊贵的杰拉尔德·沃德 A.D.C.出席。

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White’s, the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting. From Cahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes’s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy’s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y’S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott’s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl’s a Yorkshire girl.
车队在谄媚的警察的敬礼下从凤凰公园的下门出发，沿着北部码头穿过金斯布里奇。总督在穿过大都市的途中受到了最热烈的欢迎。在血色桥上，河对岸的托马斯·克南先生徒劳地从远处迎接他。 在皇后桥和惠特沃斯桥之间，达德利勋爵的总督马车经过，达德利·怀特先生，B.L.，M.A.，站在当铺M.E.怀特夫人家外的阿伦码头上，没有向他致敬。他用食指抚摸着鼻子，在阿兰街西的拐角处，犹豫着是否应该转三次有轨电车、叫车或步行穿过史密斯菲尔德、宪法山和布罗德斯通终点站，更快地到达菲柏斯伯勒。在四法院的门廊里奇·古尔丁带着古尔丁的旅行袋，科利斯和沃德惊讶地看到了他。过了里士满桥，在爱国保险公司代理人鲁本·J·多德的办公室门口，一位正要进去的老妇人改变了计划，沿着国王的窗户往回走，对国王陛下的代表微笑着。波德尔河从汤姆·德万办公室下面的伍德码头墙上的水闸中忠诚地悬挂着一条液态污水。在奥蒙德酒店的百叶窗上方，金色和青铜色的肯尼迪小姐的头挨着杜斯小姐的头被观看和欣赏。在奥蒙德码头，西蒙·迪达勒斯先生从温室驶向副治安官办公室，他站在街道中间，低着帽子。阁下亲切地回应了迪达勒斯先生的问候。在卡希尔的角落里，牧师休·C·洛夫（Hugh C. Love），文学硕士，在不被察觉的情况下行了顶礼，他留意到那些曾经仁慈地握住过昔日富有的拥护者之手的上议院代表们。 在格拉坦桥上，莱内汉和麦考伊互相道别，看着马车驶过。路过罗杰·格林的办公室和多拉德的红色大印刷厂时，格蒂·麦克道尔拿着凯茨比的软木油毡信给她躺着的父亲，从风格上看出来是勋爵和女中尉，但她看不到阁下穿的是什么，因为电车和斯普林那辆黄色的大家具货车因为是中尉而不得不停在她面前。在伦迪福特酒窖的另一边，卡瓦纳酒窖的阴暗门外，约翰·怀斯·诺兰（John Wyse Nolan）对这位爱尔兰中将兼总督露出了看不见的冷漠微笑。达德利伯爵威廉·亨布尔阁下，G.C.V.O.，经过米奇·安德森的计时手表，以及亨利和詹姆斯的蜡像西装、新鲜脸颊的模特，绅士亨利，更尼尔·克里斯·詹姆斯。汤姆·罗奇福德（Tom Rochford）和大鼻子弗林（Nosy Flynn）对着圣母院大门看着这支队伍的到来。汤姆·罗奇福德看到达德利夫人的目光注视着他，迅速从深紫红色背心的口袋里掏出拇指，向她脱下帽子。迷人的红娘子，伟大的玛丽·肯德尔，双颊粉红，裙子掀起，从她的海报上向达德利伯爵威廉·亨布尔、赫塞尔廷中校以及尊敬的杰拉尔德·沃德·A·D·C 微笑着。海恩斯严肃地越过热切客人的肩膀俯视着总督的马车，他们的大量身影使约翰·霍华德·帕内尔专心致志地看着的棋盘变暗了。在福恩斯的街道上，迪莉·德达勒斯（Dilly Dedalus）从夏德纳尔的第一本法语入门书向上抬起视线，看到遮阳篷张开，轮辐在眩光中旋转。 约翰·亨利·门顿（John Henry Menton）站在商业大厦的门口，用一双大牡蛎眼睛盯着他，他那肥大的左手握着一块厚厚的金猎人手表，没有看，也没有感觉。比利国王的马的前腿在空中抓地，布林夫人将她匆忙的丈夫从护卫者的蹄下拉了回来。她在他耳边大喊这个消息。他明白了，将典籍移至左胸前，向第二辆马车行礼。尊敬的杰拉尔德·沃德 (Gerald Ward) A.D.C. 感到惊讶不已，急忙做出答复。在庞森比的拐角处，一只破旧的白色酒壶 H. 停了下来，四只戴着高帽的白色酒壶停在他身后，E.L.Y’S，而护卫们则欢快地从马车旁走过。在皮戈特的音乐仓库对面，丹尼斯·J·马金尼先生是一位舞蹈与舞蹈学教授，他衣着华丽，走路庄重，被一位总督超越，却无人注意。布莱兹·博伊兰 (Blazes Boylan) 兴高采烈地来到教务长的墙旁，穿着带有天蓝色钟表的棕褐色鞋子和袜子，嘴里唱着“我的女孩是约克郡女孩”。

Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cortège:
布莱兹·博伊兰向领导人的天蓝色前额和高调动作赠送了一条天蓝色领带、一顶斜角宽边草帽和一套靛蓝色哔叽西装。他的双手插在夹克口袋里，忘记了行礼，但他向三位女士展示了大胆的钦佩眼神和唇间的红花。当他们沿着拿骚街行驶时，阁下吸引了他鞠躬的配偶注意学院公园里正在讨论的音乐节目。看不见的厚颜无耻的高地女士们在送行队伍后面大声喊叫，敲着鼓：

But though she’s a factory lass
但虽然她是个工厂姑娘

And wears no fancy clothes.
并且不穿华丽的衣服。

Baraabum.
巴拉布姆。

Yet I’ve a sort of a
但我有一种

Yorkshire relish for
约克郡人喜欢

My little Yorkshire rose.
我的小约克夏玫瑰。

Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn’s hotel Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity’s postern a loyal king’s man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent’s. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy’s path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.
墙那边，四分之一英里平坦的让分员 M. C. Green、H. Shrift、T. M. Patey、C. Scaife、J. B. Jeffs、G. N. Morphy、F. Stevenson、C. Adderly 和 W. C. Huggard 开始追击。大步走过芬恩的酒店卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔，透过奥匈副领事馆窗户里的镜片，透过凶狠的镜片，凝视着M.E.所罗门斯先生头上的车厢。在伦斯特街深处，三一学院的后院，一位忠诚的国王随从霍恩布洛尔触摸了他的塔利霍帽。当光鲜亮丽的马匹在梅林广场上腾跃时，等候的帕特里克·阿洛伊修斯·迪格纳姆大师看到有人向戴着礼帽的绅士行礼，并用涂有猪排纸的手指举起他的新黑色帽子。他的衣领也竖了起来。总督在前往米鲁斯集市落成典礼的途中，为默瑟医院提供资金援助，他带着追随者驱车前往下山街。他经过了布罗德本特对面的一个盲人小伙子。在下山街上，一个穿着棕色麦金托什机的行人，吃着干面包，迅速穿过总督的道路，毫发无伤。在皇家运河桥上，尤金·斯特拉顿先生在他的围墙上，咧着圆圆的嘴唇，向所有来访者表示欢迎来到彭布罗克镇。在哈丁顿路拐角处，两个穿着沙子的女人停下来，手里拿着一把雨伞和一个袋子，袋子里滚动着十一个鸟蛤，惊讶地看着市长大人和女市长没有金链子。在诺森伯兰郡和兰斯当路上，阁下准时收到了罕见的男性步行者的敬礼，两名小学生在房子花园门口的敬礼，据说已故女王与她的丈夫、王子驸马访问爱尔兰首都时对此表示赞赏， 1849 年，阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼 (Almidano Artifoni) 厚实的裤子被关上的门吞没了。

Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.
铜牌对金牌，杜斯小姐的头挨着肯尼迪小姐的头，奥蒙德酒吧的百叶窗外传来总督的马蹄声，响起钢铁般的声音。

—Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.
——是她吗？肯尼迪小姐问道。

Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil.

She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.
她往茶杯里倒了茶，又把茶倒回茶壶里。他们蜷缩在柜台下，坐在脚凳上等待，板条箱翻过来，等待茶被倒出。他们用爪子抓着自己的衬衫，都是黑缎子的，两码和九码一码，等待茶水端上，还有两码和七码。

Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.

Miss bronze unbloused her neck.

—No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?

Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.
杜斯小姐半站着，斜视着镀金字母的酒吧镜子里自己的皮肤，酒杯和酒杯闪闪发光，中间有一个贝壳。

Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
向她的脖子和双手告别，Douce小姐

—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.
——这些东西只会引起皮疹，回答道，然后重新坐下。我向博伊德店的那个老家伙要了一些适合我皮肤的东西。

Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
肯尼迪小姐现在倒了一杯茶，做了个鬼脸，祈祷道：

She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
她恶心地喝了一口她的茶，热茶，喝了一口，喝了一口甜茶。

—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
——他来了，杜丝小姐说，她把青铜色的脑袋歪了四分之三，弄乱了她的鼻翼。虎发！虎发！

Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.
肯尼迪小姐的喉咙里发出尖锐的笑声。杜斯小姐气喘吁吁，鼻孔里喷着鼻息，鼻孔在里面颤抖着，就像一个正在寻找的鼻子。

Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
杜斯小姐用深古铜色的笑声插话，喊道：

—And your other eye!

Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore’s huguenot name. By Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus’ son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.
布卢乌的黑眼睛里写着亚伦·菲加特纳的名字。为什么我总是想到费格？我想，是在采集无花果。还有 Prosper Lore 的胡格诺派名字。布鲁姆的黑眼睛从巴西神圣的处女身边掠过。蓝袍，白衣，到我这里来。他们相信她是上帝：或女神。今天的那些。我看不到。那家伙说话了。一个学生。和迪达勒斯的儿子在一起之后。他可能是穆里根。都是清秀的处女。这让那些家伙进来了：她的白人。

By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
他的眼睛消失了。罪恶的甜蜜。甜食就是甜食。

Of sin.
罪孽。

In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.
在咯咯的笑声中，年轻的金铜色声音混合在一起，杜斯和肯尼迪是你的另一只眼睛。他们把年轻的头向后仰，古铜色的咯咯笑，自由地放声大笑，尖叫，你的另一个，互相发出信号，高亢的音符。

Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.
啊，气喘吁吁，叹气，叹气，啊，可惜了，他们的欢笑戛然而止。

Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:
肯尼迪小姐再次抿了抿杯子，举起喝了一口，咯咯地笑起来。杜斯小姐弯下腰，伏在茶盘上，再次皱起了鼻子，转动着滑稽的肥眼睛。肯尼吉格斯再次弯下腰，她那白皙的尖顶头发弯下腰，露出了乌龟般的后颈，把茶从嘴里喷出来，她被茶和笑声呛住了，咳嗽着，哭着：

—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!
——啊，油腻的眼睛！想象一下嫁给这样的男人！她哭了。还带着他的小胡子！

—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
——嫁给油腻的鼻子！她喊道。

Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
尖锐的、低沉的笑声，金铜色之后，他们催促着每个人敲响又敲响，响彻变化，铜金，金铜，尖锐深沉，笑声接着笑声。然后笑得更厉害了。油腻我知道。他们筋疲力尽，气喘吁吁，摇着头，把光滑的梳子编成辫子，顶在柜台上。全身通红（噢！），气喘吁吁，出汗（噢！），气喘吁吁。

Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.
嫁给了布鲁姆，为了油脂绽放。

—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished

I hadn’t laughed so much. I feel all wet.
我没笑过那么多。我感觉浑身湿透了。

——哦，杜丝小姐！肯尼迪小姐抗议道。你这个可怕的东西！

And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
而且脸更红了（你太可怕了！），更红了。

By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.
坎特韦尔的办公室里到处都是油脂花，塞皮的处女们，她们的油都闪闪发亮。南内蒂的父亲到处兜售这些东西，就像我一样在门口哄骗。宗教是有回报的。一定要见他那个标准杆。先吃饭。我想。还没有。四点钟，她说。时间不断流逝。时针转动。在。去哪里吃？克拉伦斯号、海豚号。在。对于拉乌尔.吃。如果我通过这些广告赚到五基尼。紫罗兰色丝绸衬裙。还没有。罪恶的甜蜜。

Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
脸色更淡了，甚至更淡了，脸色呈金黄色。

Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.

Jingle.
叮当。

—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
——杜斯小姐欣然同意。

With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.
她优雅而敏捷地转向坎特雷尔和科克伦的镀金镜子。她优雅地从水晶桶里敲出一杯金色威士忌。迪达勒斯先生从外套裙边拿出袋子和烟斗。她服务敏捷。他从烟道里吹了两支哈士奇长笛。

—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.
——天哪，他沉思道，我经常想去看看莫恩山脉。那里的空气一定是极好的滋补品。但他们说，长期的威胁终于到来了。是的。是的。

她读了《女孩金》，但没有看一眼。不加理会。当他为她死记硬背一首唱名寓言时，她没有注意到，平淡地拍着嗓子：

Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
餐厅的铃声响起，唤起了她的怜悯。酒吧和餐厅的门口来了秃顶的帕特，烦躁的帕特，奥蒙德的服务员帕特。晚餐用啤酒。她端来的淡啤酒并不敏捷。

With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.
莱内汉耐心地等待着博伊兰，他不耐烦地等待着，因为男孩的热情洋溢。

Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
他（谁？）举起盖子，凝视着棺材（棺材？）中倾斜的三重（钢琴！）电线。他按下（也是宽容地按下她的手的那个人），轻柔的踏板，三重琴键，以看到毛毡的厚度前进，听到低沉的锤子落下的声音。

Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.
两张奶油色牛皮纸，一张预留两个信封，是我在Wisdom Hely的wise Bloom in Daly的Henry Flower买的。你在家里不开心吗？花来安慰我，一根别针割断了洛。意味着某种东西，流动的语言。这是一朵雏菊吗？那就是纯真。受人尊敬的女孩在弥撒后见面。非常感谢。明智的布鲁姆盯着门上的一张海报，上面是一条摇曳的美人鱼，在美丽的波浪中冒着烟。烟美人鱼，最酷的味道。头发流淌：失恋。对于某些男人来说。对于拉乌尔.他凝视着，远远地看到埃塞克斯桥上，一顶华丽的帽子骑在一辆疾驰的汽车上。这是。再次。第三次。巧合。

Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.

In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.
在昏昏欲睡的沉默中，金色在她的书页上弯曲。

From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.
客厅里传来一声呼唤，呼唤声已经快要死了。那是调音师的音叉，他忘记了他现在敲击了。又来电话了他现在已经做好了准备，现在它在颤动。你听？它的尖头在嗡嗡作响，它在跳动，纯净，更加纯净，越来越柔和。临死召唤的时间更长。

Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss

在敏感的双手下，十二指肠的鸟鸣声发出明亮的高音回应。明亮的琴键，闪烁，相连，全是大键琴，召唤着一个声音，唱出露水的早晨、青春、爱的告别、生命的、爱的早晨的曲调。

—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.

时钟呼呼地响着。肯尼迪小姐从他们身边走过（鲜花，不知道是谁送的），手里拿着茶盘。时钟嘎嘎作响。

Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.
杜斯小姐接过博伊兰的硬币，大胆地敲击收银机。它叮当作响。时钟嘎嘎作响。一位漂亮的埃及人在收银台里逗弄和分类，哼着歌，递上零钱的硬币。向西看。咔嚓一声。为我。

—What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
——那是几点了？布莱兹·博伊兰问道。四个？

O’clock.
点了。

Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.
莱内汉用小眼睛盯着她的嗡嗡声和嗡嗡声的胸部，拉扯布莱兹·博伊兰的肘袖。

—Let’s hear the time, he said.
——让我们听听时间，他说。

The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn’t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
古尔丁、科利斯、沃德的包带领着布鲁姆走过黑麦花桌。他漫无目的地选择了靠近门的一张桌子，秃顶的帕特在场。靠近一点。四点钟。他忘记了吗？也许是一个诡计。不来：开胃。我做不到。等等。帕特，服务员，等着。

Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.
布拉祖尔天蓝色的弓和眼睛上闪烁着青铜色的蔚蓝眼睛。

—Go on, pressed Lenehan. There’s no-one. He never heard.
——继续说吧，莱内汉催促道。没有人。他从来没有听说过。

— … to Flora’s lips did hie.
——……从弗洛拉的嘴里说出来了。

High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.
高音，高音清晰。

Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought
青铜杜斯与她的玫瑰交谈，玫瑰沉没，玫瑰寻找

Blazes Boylan’s flower and eyes.
点燃了博伊兰的花朵和眼睛。

—Please, please.
——拜托，拜托。

He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
他恳求回复承认的短语。

—I could not leave thee …
——我不能离开你……

—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
——事后，杜斯小姐腼腆地答应道。

—No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnezlacloche! O do! There’s no-one.
——不，现在，莱内汉催促道。太阳神！哦，做吧！没有人。

She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.
她看。快的。肯恩小姐听不到。突然弯腰。两张炽热的脸看着她弯下腰。

Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.
颤抖的和弦从空中飘散，又找到了，失去了和弦，又失去了又找到了，步履蹒跚。

—Go on! Do! Sonnez!
-继续！做！索内兹！

Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
她弯下腰，将膝盖以上的裙摆咬断。延迟。仍然奚落他们，弯着腰，悬在空中，目光任性。

—Sonnez!
——索内兹！

Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.
咂。她突然松开了她那被咬住的弹性吊袜带，温暖地贴在她穿得暖和的大腿上。

—La Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.
——拉克洛什！莱内汉高兴地喊道。经业主培训。那里没有锯末。

She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
她傲慢地傻笑着（哭了！不是男人吗？），但是，她轻轻地滑行，温和地对博伊兰微笑。

—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
——你就是粗俗的本质，她滑翔着说。

Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
博伊兰，眼睛，眼睛。他把圣杯扔到肥厚的嘴唇上，小口地喝掉圣杯，吮吸最后的肥大的紫罗兰糖浆。他那双着迷的眼睛追随着她的头，她的头沿着酒吧的镜子滑下来，姜汁汽水的镀金拱门，飞节和红葡萄酒杯闪闪发光，尖刺的贝壳，在那里它协调一致，镜面，青铜与阳光的青铜。

Yes, bronze from anearby.
是的，附近的青铜。

— … Sweetheart, goodbye!
——……亲爱的，再见！

—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.
——我走了，博伊兰不耐烦地说。

He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
他轻快地滑开圣杯，拿起零钱。

—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
——等一下，摇晃一下，莱内汉恳求道，他很快就喝了下去。我原本想告诉你。

Tom Rochford …
汤姆·罗奇福德…

—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
——来吧，布莱兹·博伊兰边说边走。

Lenehan gulped to go.
莱内汉咽了口口水，准备走。

—Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I’m coming.
——有喇叭还是什么？他说。等待。我来了。

He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
他跟在嘎吱作响的匆忙鞋子后面，但敏捷地站在门槛旁，向一个身材魁梧又纤细的人行礼。

—How do you do, Mr Dollard?
——你好吗，多拉德先生？

—Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley’s woe. He won’t give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We’ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.
——呃？怎么办？怎么办？本·多拉德模糊的低音回答了他，瞬间从考利神父的悲伤中转过来。他不会给你带来任何麻烦，鲍勃。阿尔夫·贝尔根将与这位长者交谈。这次我们要把一根大麦秆塞进加略人犹大的耳朵里。

Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
德达勒斯先生叹着气穿过酒吧，一根手指抚着眼睑。

—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.
——呵呵，我们会的，本·多拉德快活地唱道。来吧，西蒙。给我们一首小曲。我们听到了钢琴声。

Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
秃头帕特，烦躁的服务员，等待饮料订单。为里奇提供力量。布鲁姆呢？让我看看。不让他走两次。他的鸡眼。现在四个。这黑色是多么温暖啊。当然有点紧张。折射（是吗？）热量。让我看看。苹果酒。是的，一瓶苹果酒。

—What’s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.
-那是什么？迪达勒斯先生说道。我只是在吸食，伙计。

—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.
——来吧，来吧，本·多拉德喊道。告别沉闷的关怀。来吧，鲍勃。

He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
他缓步拖着多拉德，在他们面前（用“抓住那个家伙：现在抓住他”）走进了酒吧。他把他放在凳子上。他患痛风的爪子弹奏着和弦。扑通扑通，突然停了下来。

Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.
光头帕特在门口遇见无茶金回来。他很烦恼，想要力量和苹果酒。窗边的青铜，远远望去，青铜。

Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
丁当叮叮当当一动。

Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He’s off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He’s gone. Jingle. Hear.
布卢姆听到“叮”的一声，轻微的声音。他下班了。布鲁姆轻轻地抽泣着，对着沉默的蓝色花朵叹了口气。叮铃。他走了。叮当。听到。

—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.
——爱情与战争，本，迪达勒斯先生说。愿上帝与旧时光同在。

Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.
杜斯小姐那双勇敢的眼睛，被阳光迷住了，没有被人注意，从交叉百叶窗上转过来。走了。沉思着（谁知道呢？），迷住了（那耀眼的光芒），她用滑绳放下了百叶窗。她沉思地画下（为什么当我时他走得那么快？）关于她的青铜色，在酒吧里，秃头站在金姐妹旁边，不精致的对比，对比不精致的不精致，缓慢凉爽的暗淡海绿色滑动深度的阴影，淡蓝色。

—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.
——可怜的老古德温是那天晚上的钢琴家，考利神父提醒他们。他自己和 Collard 三角钢琴之间的意见略有不同。

There was.
有。

—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn’t stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
——一场完全属于他自己的研讨会，迪达勒斯先生说。魔鬼不会阻止他。他是个酒后脾气暴躁的老家伙。

—God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
——天哪，你还记得吗？本·多拉德从受惩罚的键盘上转过身来说道。雅珀斯说我没有结婚礼服。

They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.
他们三个都笑了。他没有结婚。三个人都笑了。没有结婚礼服。

—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where’s my pipe, by the way?
——那天晚上我们的朋友布鲁姆派上了用场，迪达勒斯先生说。顺便问一下，我的烟斗在哪里？

He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.
他漫步回到酒吧，找到那根丢失的和弦管。秃头帕特端着两位食客的饮料，里奇和波尔迪。考利神父又笑了。

—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.
——我想，本，我挽救了局面。

—You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.
——你做到了，本·多拉德断言。我还记得那条紧身裤。这是个好主意，鲍勃。

Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.
考利神父的脸红到了他闪亮的紫色耳垂。他挽救了局面。紧特鲁。很棒的想法。

—I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh’s gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.
——我知道他已经触礁了，他说。妻子周六在咖啡宫里弹钢琴，只是为了一点微不足道的考虑，是谁让我因为她在做其他事情而喘息呢？你是否记得？我们不得不搜索整个霍尔斯街才能找到他们，直到基奥店的小伙子给了我们电话号码。记住？本回忆道，他那张宽阔的脸上充满了疑惑。

—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
——上帝啊，她那里有一些豪华的歌剧斗篷之类的东西。

Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
迪达勒斯先生手里拿着烟斗漫步回来。

—Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn’t take any money either. What? Any God’s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?
—Merrion 方形风格。舞会礼服，上帝啊，还有宫廷礼服。他也不会拿任何钱。什么？任何上帝数量的三角帽、短上衣和长筒袜。什么？

—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.
——嗯，嗯，迪达勒斯先生点点头。马里昂·布鲁姆夫人没有穿任何类型的衣服。

Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
叮当沿着码头晃动着。火焰蔓延在跳跃的轮胎上。

Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.
肝脏和培根。牛排和肾脏馅饼。是的，先生。对，帕特。

Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.
马里恩夫人。遇见了他的长矛软管。烧焦的气味。保罗·德科克。他这个名字真好听

—What’s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion …

—Tweedy.
——特威迪。

—Yes. Is she alive?
-是的。她还活着吗？

—And kicking.

—She was a daughter of …
——她是……的女儿

—Daughter of the regiment.
——团里的女儿。

—Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.
——是的，求求你了。我记得老鼓手。

Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
迪达勒斯先生敲击、嗖嗖、点燃、喷出美味的泡芙。

—Irish? I don’t know, faith. Is she, Simon?
——爱尔兰人？我不知道，信仰。她是西蒙吗？

Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
泡芙后硬挺，一泡，劲道，香香，噼啪。

—Buccinator muscle is … What? … Bit rusty … O, she is … My Irish Molly, O.
——颊肌是……什么？ ……有点生锈了……哦，她是……我的爱尔兰莫莉，哦。

He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
他喷出一股刺鼻的羽毛味。

—From the rock of Gibraltar … all the way.
——来自直布罗陀的岩石……一路走来。

They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.
他们在海洋深处的阴影中憔悴，金色的啤酒，青铜色的黑樱桃酒，两者都深思熟虑。米娜·肯尼迪，利斯莫尔露台 4 号，德拉姆康德拉与偶像，女王，多洛雷斯，沉默。

Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
拍拍，未盖的菜肴。利奥波德切肝片。正如之前所说，他津津有味地吃着内脏、坚果砂囊、炸鳕鱼子，而里奇·古尔丁、科利斯、沃德则吃牛排和腰子，牛排然后腰子，他一口一口地吃着布卢姆吃的馅饼，他们也吃。

Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.
布鲁姆和古尔丁默默地结婚了，一起吃饭。适合王子的晚餐。

By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.
单身汉散步时，单身汉布莱兹·博伊兰在炎热的阳光下，马儿光滑的臀部在跳跃的轮胎上旋转：四肢伸开，温暖的座位，博伊兰不耐烦，热情大胆。喇叭。你有吗？喇叭。你有吗？呜呜喇叭。

Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:
在他们的声音中，多拉德用巴松管演奏，在轰鸣的和弦上轰鸣：

—When love absorbs my ardent soul …
——当爱吸收我炽热的灵魂时……

Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.
本索尔本杰明的一卷滚到颤抖的、爱颤抖的屋顶玻璃上。

—War! War! cried Father Cowley. You’re the warrior.
-战争！战争！考利神父喊道。你是战士。

—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.
——原来如此，本·沃里尔笑道。我想到了你的房东。爱情或者金钱。

He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
他停下来了。他摇着大胡子，大脸掩盖了他的巨大错误。

—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
——当然，你会弄破她的耳膜，伙计，迪达勒斯先生透过烟雾的香气说，用像你这样的器官。

In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.
多拉德大胡子大笑，敲击着键盘。他会。

—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.
——更不用说另一层膜了，考利神父补充道。半场结束，本。 Amoroso ma non troppo。让我去那里。

Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn’t say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.
肯尼迪小姐为两位绅士端上了一杯凉爽的烈性黑啤酒。她说了一句话。第一位先生说，这确实是一个美丽的天气。他们喝的是凉爽的黑啤酒。她知道中尉要去哪里吗？又听见钢蹄声蹄声响起。不，她不能说。但它会出现在报纸上。哦，她不需要麻烦。没事。她挥舞着展开的独立衣，搜寻着，中尉勋爵，她那尖尖的头发缓慢地移动着，中尉勋爵。太麻烦了，第一位先生说。哦，一点也不。他看起来就是那样。少尉阁下。金由青铜闻铁钢。

— … … … … my ardent soul
——………………我热情的灵魂

I care not foror the morrow.
我不在乎明天。

In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard’s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who’s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.
布卢姆在肝肉汁中捣碎土豆泥。有人是爱与战争。本·多拉德很有名。晚上他跑来找我们借一套音乐会用的礼服。裤子在他身上紧如鼓。音乐猪。当他出去时，莫莉确实笑了。她向后仰倒在床上，尖叫着，踢着。他的所有物品都展示出来了。天上的圣徒啊，我湿透了！哦，前排的女士们！哦，我从来没有笑过这么多！嗯，当然这就是他的基本桶音的原因。比如太监。想知道谁在玩。手感很好。一定是考利。音乐。知道你弹奏的任何音符。他有口臭，可怜的家伙。停了。

Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady’s) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.
杜斯小姐，迷人的莉迪亚·杜斯向温文尔雅的律师乔治·利德韦尔鞠躬，绅士走进来。下午好。她把她湿润的（一位女士的）手放在他的紧紧的怀抱里。下午。是的，她回来了。又到老叮当了。

—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
——你的朋友在里面，利德威尔先生。

George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.
乔治·利德威尔，温文尔雅，恳求，握着利迪亚手。

Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.
正如之前所说，布卢姆吃了丽芙。至少这里干净。伯顿的那个家伙，粘着软骨。这里没有人：古尔丁和我。清洁桌子、鲜花、餐巾纸。来回拍拍。秃头帕特。没事做。配音的最佳价值。

Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.
又弹钢琴了考利 是的。他坐在一起的方式，就像在一起一样，相互理解。令人厌烦的塑形师刮小提琴、盯着琴弓、锯大提琴，让你想起牙痛。她的鼾声又高又长。晚上我们在包厢里。长号像鲸鱼一样吹奏，在表演之间，其他铜管小伙子拧开螺丝，排空唾沫。指挥的腿也是，袋装裤，摇摇晃晃。正确隐藏它们。

Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.
Jiggedy 叮当欢快的欢快。

Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy’s rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.
只有竖琴。迷人的。金色的光芒闪烁。女孩摸了摸它。可爱的便便。肉汁非常适合。黄金船。艾琳。竖琴那一两次。双手凉爽。本·霍斯，杜鹃花。我们是他们的竖琴。我、他。老的。年轻的。

—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.
——啊，我不能，伙计，迪达勒斯先生害羞而无精打采地说。

Strongly.
强烈。

—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.
——来吧，炸死你！本·多拉德咆哮道。一点一点地把它拿出来。

—M’appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.
——考利神父说，西蒙·姆阿帕里。

Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.
他在台下大步走了几步，表情严肃，高高的，露出了长长的手臂。他喉咙里的苹果轻轻地嘶哑着。他对着尘土飞扬的海景轻声唱道：《最后的告别》。一个岬角，一艘船，一艘在波涛上航行的帆。告别。一个可爱的女孩，她的面纱随着岬角上的风飘扬，缠绕在她身上。

Cowley sang:
考利唱道：

—M’appari tutt’amor:
——M’appari tut’amor：

Il mio sguardo l’incontr …
我要保护你……

She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.
她挥手，考利没有听见，她的面纱，向一个即将离去的人，亲爱的，向风，向爱，向加速航行，向归来。

—Go on, Simon.
——继续吧，西蒙。

—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben … Well …
——啊，当然，我的跳舞日子已经结束了，本……好吧……

Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.
迪达勒斯先生把他的烟斗放在音叉旁边，坐下来，触摸听话的琴键。

—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.
——不，西蒙，考利神父转过身来。按原版来玩吧一间公寓。

The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
钥匙，听话，升得更高，告诉，犹豫，坦白，困惑。

Up stage strode Father Cowley.
考利神父大步走上舞台。

—Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said. Get up.
——来吧，西蒙，我陪你，他说。起床。

By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.
伴随着格雷厄姆·莱蒙的菠萝岩，伴随着埃尔弗里的大象叮当作响的慢跑。牛排、腰子、肝脏，捣碎，适合王子享用的肉是布鲁姆王子和古尔丁王子。王子们吃着他们养大的肉，喝着权力和苹果酒。

Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.
有史以来最美丽的男高音曲调，里奇说：“Sonnabula”。有一天晚上，他听到乔·马斯唱那首歌。啊，什么啊，古金！是的。以他的方式。唱诗班风格。马斯就是那个男孩。弥撒男孩。如果你愿意的话，可以是抒情男高音。永远不要忘记。绝不。

Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright’s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he’s wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.
温柔的布鲁姆在无肝培根上看到了紧绷的五官紧张。腰疼他。 Bright的眼睛明亮。节目的下一个项目。付钱给风笛手。药片、捣碎的面包，一盒值一几尼。暂时搁置一下。也唱：在死人中间。合适的。肾饼。甜食来了。没有做太多的事。最具价值。他的特点。力量。特别注意他的饮料。玻璃上有瑕疵，新鲜的 Vartry 水。从计数器中取出火柴来保存。然后点点滴滴地挥霍金币。而当他想要的却是一分钱也没有的时候。拒绝支付车费，真是太糟糕了。好奇的类型。

Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.
里奇永远不会忘记那个夜晚。只要他还活着：永远不会。在老皇家与小皮克的众神之中。又当第一注。

Speech paused on Richie’s lips.
里奇的话停在了嘴边。

Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.
现在出来了。关于该死的一切的狂想曲。

Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.
相信自己的谎言。确实如此。很棒的骗子。但想要一个美好的回忆。

—Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.
——那是什么空气？利奥波德·布鲁姆问道。

—All is lost now.
——现在一切都失去了。

Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.
里奇翘起了嘴唇。女妖用低沉的声音低声说道：全部。画眉鸟。一只画眉鸟。他的呼吸带着鸟儿般的清甜，他引以为傲的好牙齿，却充满了哀伤的哀伤。丢失了。丰富的声音。那里有两个音符合二为一。我在山楂谷听到了黑鸟的声音。他抓住了我的动机，将它们交织在一起并翻转。所有最新的召唤都消失殆尽。回声。多么甜蜜的答案啊。这是怎么做到的？现在全都失去了。他悲伤地吹了声口哨。跌倒、投降、迷失。

Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don’t know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That’s why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.
布卢姆弯下利奥波德的耳朵，把多伊利的一缕流苏翻到花瓶下面。命令。是的，我记得。可爱的空气。睡梦中她走向他。月亮里的纯真。勇敢的。不知道他们的危险。还是拦着她。叫名字。接触水。叮当欢快。为时已晚。她很想去。这就是为什么。女士。一样容易停海。是的：一切都失去了。

—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.
——美丽的空气，布卢姆说，失去了利奥波德。我很了解。

Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.
他一生中从未有过里奇·古尔丁。

He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?
他也很清楚这一点。或者他感觉。还在念念不忘女儿。聪明的孩子，了解她的父亲，德达勒斯说。我？

Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
布卢姆斜视着无肝的锯子。一切的面子都丢光了。里奇曾经很开心。笑话现在已经过时了。摇着耳朵。餐巾环在他的眼睛里。现在他正在乞讨他寄给儿子的信。斗鸡眼沃尔特先生，我做到了，先生。不会有麻烦，只是我期待一些钱。道歉。

Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.
又弹钢琴了听起来比我上次听到的要好。大概是调好了。又停了下来。

Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.
多拉德和考利仍然敦促这位挥之不去的歌手放弃它。

—With it, Simon.
——有了它，西蒙。

—It, Simon.
——它，西蒙。

—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.
——女士们、先生们，我对你们的善意恳求深表谢意。

—It, Simon.
——它，西蒙。

—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.
——我没有钱，但如果你愿意关注我，我会尽力为你唱一首低头的心歌。

By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.
莉迪亚在遮蔽阴影中的三明治钟声旁，她的青铜色和玫瑰色，一种女士的优雅，给予和克制：就像在清凉的白皙尼尔米娜淡香水中，她的两杯金色顶峰一样。

The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.
前奏曲悠扬的和弦结束了。一阵拉长的、充满期待的和弦把声音拉走了。

—When first I saw that form endearing …
——当我第一次看到那个可爱的形状时……

Richie turned.
里奇转过身来。

—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.
——西·迪达勒斯的声音，他说。

Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.
他们头脑发热，脸颊接触到火焰，他们聆听着那股可爱的电流流过皮肤、四肢、人类的心脏、灵魂和脊柱。布鲁姆向帕特签了字，秃顶的帕特是一名听力不好的服务员，把酒吧的门半开着。酒吧门口。所以。这样就可以了。帕特，服务员，等着，等着听，因为他在门口很难听清。

—Sorrow from me seemed to depart.
——我的悲伤似乎消失了。

Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.
透过寂静的空气，有一个声音向他们低声歌唱，不是雨声，不是树叶的低语，不像弦乐或芦苇的声音，也不像扬琴的声音，用言语触动着他们静止的耳朵，触动着他们每个记忆中生活的静止的心。很好，很高兴听到：当他们第一次听到时，他们每个人的悲伤似乎都消失了。当他们第一次看到失去的里奇·波尔迪时，美丽的仁慈，从一个人那里听到了，她的第一个仁慈的爱——最受喜爱的词。

Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love’s old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.
爱在歌唱：爱是一首古老而甜美的歌。布卢姆慢慢地解开包裹上的松紧带。爱情的古老甜蜜颂歌。布卢姆将一根绳子缠绕在四个叉指上，拉伸它，放松，然后将它缠绕在他陷入困境的双指上，四倍地，八度，快速地旋转它们。

—Full of hope and all delighted …
——满怀希望，万事欣喜……

Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can’t sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.
男高音靠分数赢得女人。增加他们的流量。把花扔到他脚边。我们什么时候才能见面？我的头脑很简单。叮当都高兴了。他不会为高帽子唱歌。你的头简直在旋转。为他熏香。你老婆用什么香水？我想知道。靖.停止。敲。她开门前总是最后一次看镜子。大厅。那里？你怎么？我做得很好。那里？什么？或者？她的书包里装着一小瓶接吻蜜饯。是的？双手感受着富裕。

Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.
唉，声音升起，叹息着，变了：响亮、饱满、闪亮、骄傲。

—But alas, ‘twas idle dreaming …
——可惜，这只是一场白日梦……

Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn’t break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.
他的语气依然光荣。软木空气也更柔软，他们的布洛克语也更柔和。愚蠢的人！本来可以赚大钱的。唱错词了。把他的妻子累坏了：现在唱歌。但很难说。只有他们两个人自己。如果他不崩溃的话。继续向大道小跑。他的手和脚也会唱歌。喝。神经过度紧张。唱歌一定要节制。珍妮·林德汤：高汤、鼠尾草、生鸡蛋、半品脱奶油。为奶油般的梦幻。

Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That’s the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.
温柔涌上心头：缓慢、肿胀、充满悸动。这就是聊天。哈，给！拿！颤动，颤动，骄傲的勃起。

Words? Music? No: it’s what’s behind.
字？音乐？不：这就是后面的内容。

Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.
布卢姆有环的、无环的、结节的、脱节的。

Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.
盛开。温暖的jamjam lickitup秘密的洪水在音乐中流淌出来，在欲望中，黑暗地舔流入侵。轻推她，轻拍她，轻拍她，压在她身上。嘟嘟。毛孔扩张扩张。嘟嘟。喜悦，感觉温暖。嘟嘟。倾倒在水闸上，倾泻而出。洪水，喷涌，流动，欢乐喷涌，tupthrob。现在！爱的语言。

— … ray of hope is …
——……希望之光是……

Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.
喜气洋洋。莉迪亚对利德威尔的吱吱声几乎没有听到如此淑女般的缪斯女神发出一丝跳跃声。

Martha it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel’s song. Lovely name you have. Can’t write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She’s a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.
玛莎 是的。巧合。刚要写。莱昂内尔的歌。你的名字真可爱。写不出来。接受我的小压力。也触动了她的心弦和钱包。她是一个。我叫你顽皮的孩子。仍然是这个名字：玛莎。多么奇怪！今天。

The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.
莱昂内尔的声音又回来了，虽然微弱，但并不疲倦。它又唱给里奇·波尔迪听，莉迪亚·利德韦尔也唱给帕特张开嘴耳朵等待着。他第一次看到那种可爱的形状，悲伤似乎要分开，外观、形状和文字如何让他着迷，古尔德·利德韦尔，赢得了帕特·布鲁姆的心。

Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.
但希望我能看到他的脸。解释得更好。为什么当我对着镜子说话时，德拉戈理发师的脸总是看着我的脸。尽管距离较远，但这里仍然比酒吧里听得更好。

—Each graceful look …
——每一个优雅的眼神……

First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.
第一天晚上，我第一次见到她是在特雷努尔的马特·狄龙家。她穿着黄色、黑色蕾丝。音乐椅。我们两个最后。命运。在她之后。命运。

Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.
慢悠悠地一圈又一圈。快一轮。我们两个。都看了。停。她坐下来。全部被驱逐的样子。嘴唇在笑。膝盖发黄。

—Charmed my eye …
——迷住了我的眼睛……

Singing. Waiting she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.
唱歌。等着她唱歌。我把她的音乐翻了。你的紫丁香树用什么香水的香水的完整声音。我看到了怀抱，双双饱满，喉咙颤抖。我首先看到的。她向我表示感谢。她为什么要对我？命运。西班牙人的眼睛。此时此刻，在老马德里一侧的一棵梨树下，在阴影多洛雷斯·谢多洛雷斯的孤独露台下。对我。引诱。啊，诱人。

—Martha! Ah, Martha!
——玛莎！啊，玛莎！

Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.
莱昂内尔放弃了所有的倦怠，悲伤地哭泣，在激情的呼喊中，爱以加深但又上升的和谐和弦回归。玛莎必须感受到她应该知道的莱昂内尔孤独的哭泣。他的等待，只为了她。在哪里？这里那里尝试那里这里都尝试哪里。某处。

—Co-ome, thou lost one!
——哎哟，你丢了一个！

 Co-ome, thou dear one!
来吧，亲爱的！

Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!
独自的。唯一的爱。一个希望。一位安慰我。玛莎，胸注，回来！

—Come!
-来！

It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don’t spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness …
它翱翔，一只鸟，它保持着它的飞行，一声迅速而纯粹的叫声，翱翔的银色球体，它平静地跳跃，飞驰，持续，来，不要把它旋转得太久，长长的呼吸，他呼吸着长长的生命，翱翔得很高，很高辉煌，燃烧，加冕，象征性的光辉高，高，空灵的胸怀，高，高，无处不在的广阔照射，一切都在一切周围翱翔，无尽……

—To me!
-大部头书！

Siopold!
西奥波德！

Consumed.
消耗了。

Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.
来。唱得好听。所有人都鼓起掌来。她应该这么做。来。对我，对他，对她，对你，对我，对我们。

—Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.
——太棒了！拍手鼓掌。好人，西蒙。拍手拍手。安可！拍拍拍拍。声音如钟声。太棒了，西蒙！拍手拍手。安可，拍手，说，哭了，鼓掌所有人，本·多拉德，莉迪亚·杜斯，乔治·利德威尔，帕特，米娜·肯尼迪，两位拿着两个酒杯的绅士，考利，第一位拿着坦克的绅士，铜牌杜斯小姐和金牌MJiss米娜。

Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.
之前说过，布莱兹·博伊兰的漂亮棕褐色鞋子在酒吧地板上吱吱作响。正如刚才所说，约翰·格雷爵士的纪念碑叮当响，霍雷肖单手拉着纳尔逊，神父西奥博尔德·马修神父心神不宁。 Atrot，在热状态下，热密封。克洛什。索内斯拉。克洛什。索内斯拉。母马慢慢地沿着拉特兰广场圆形大厅上山。对博伊兰来说太慢了，博伊兰怒火中烧，不耐烦的博伊兰使母马摇摇晃晃。

An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer.
考利的和弦余音闭合，在空气中消逝，变得更加丰富。

And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.
里奇·古尔丁喝了他的力量，利奥波德·布鲁姆喝了他的苹果酒，利德威尔喝了他的吉尼斯啤酒，第二先生说，如果她不介意的话，他们会再喝两杯。肯尼迪小姐先是傻笑，珊瑚色的嘴唇，一开始是，后来也是。她并不介意。

—Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you’d sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.
——本·多拉德说，入狱七天，靠面包和水。西蒙，然后你就会像花园画眉一样唱歌。

Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.
歌手莱昂内尔·西蒙笑了。鲍勃·考利神父演奏。米娜·肯尼迪任职。二先生付了钱。汤姆·克南大摇大摆地走了进来。莉迪亚，钦佩，钦佩。但布鲁姆唱得很哑。

Admiring.
佩服。

Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang ’Twas rank and fame: in Ned Lambert’s ‘twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.
里奇对那个男人美妙的声音赞叹不已。他记得很久以前的一个晚上。永远不会忘记那个夜晚。 Si sang 'Twas 是地位和名声：在 Ned Lambert 的 'twas 中。天哪，他一生中从未听过这样的音符，他从来没有听过这样的音符，我们最好分得清楚，所以上帝他从未听到过，因为爱活着，没有叮叮当当的声音活着，不要问兰伯特，他也可以告诉你。

Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang ’Twas rank and fame.
古尔丁脸色涨得通红，他告诉布卢姆先生，夜色的代表人物，在内德·兰伯特的迪达勒斯家里，唱着“这是地位和名声”。

He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing ‘TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert’s, house.
他，布卢姆先生，听着，而他，里奇·古尔丁，告诉他，布卢姆先生，那天晚上，他，里奇，听到他，西·迪达勒斯，在内德·兰伯特家里唱《TWAS RANK AND FAME》。

Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.
姐夫：关系。我们经过时从不说话。我认为鲁特琴上有裂痕。以轻蔑的态度对待他。看。他更加钦佩他了。那天晚上斯唱歌。人声，两根丝般细小的和弦，比其他一切都美妙。

That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It’s in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.
那声音是哀叹。现在平静一些了当你感觉到你听到之后，它就在寂静中。振动。现在空气寂静无声。

Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.
布鲁姆松开交叉的双手，用松弛的手指拨动细长的肠线丁字裤。他又画又拨。它嗡嗡作响，叮当响。当古尔丁谈论巴拉克拉夫的配音制作时，汤姆·克南以一种回顾性的安排回顾过去，与聆听的考利神父交谈，考利神父演奏自愿，演奏时点头。当大本·多拉德与西蒙·迪达勒斯交谈时，他一边抽烟一边点点头，他也抽烟。

Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat’s tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. Corpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:’d.
你失去了一个。该主题的所有歌曲。布卢姆还进一步拉紧了绳子。看起来很残酷。让人们彼此喜欢：引诱他们。然后撕碎。死亡。爆炸。敲一下头。完全没有。人类生活。迪格南。哎呀，那只老鼠的尾巴在蠕动！我给了五个鲍勃。天堂语料库。玉米秧鸡：肚子像中毒的小狗。走了。他们唱歌。忘记了。我也;有一天她和。离开她：累了。那就受苦吧。鼻涕。西班牙人的大眼睛瞪着什么也看不见。她的卷发未梳。

Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. It snapped.
然而太多的快乐令人厌烦。他伸得更多、更多。你不开心吗？鼻音。它突然断了。

Jingle into Dorset street.
叮当进入多塞特街。

Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.
杜斯小姐收回了她光滑的手臂，既责备又高兴。

—Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.
——不要让一半那么自由，她说，直到我们更加熟悉为止。

George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.
乔治·利德威尔真实地告诉了她：但她不相信。

First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And second tankard told her so. That that was so.
第一绅士告诉米娜是这样的。她问他是这样吗？第二杯啤酒告诉她了。原来如此。

Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.
杜斯小姐，莉迪亚小姐，不相信：肯尼迪小姐，米娜，不相信：乔治·利德威尔，不：杜小姐不相信：第一，第一：坦克先生：相信，不，不：不，小姐肯恩：Lidlydiawell：坦克。

Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.
最好写在这里。邮局里的羽毛笔被咀嚼和扭曲。

Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.
秃头帕特在一个标志附近。一支笔和墨水。他去。一个垫子。他去。吸墨垫。他听见了，聋子帕特。

—Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It’s so characteristic.
——是的，布卢姆先生说，一边戏弄着卷曲的肠线。必然是。几行就可以了。我的礼物。意大利华丽的音乐就是这样。这是谁写的？知道你更熟悉的名字。拿出一张信纸、信封：无所谓。太有特色了

—Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.
——整部歌剧中最宏大的数字，古尔丁说。

—It is, Bloom said.
——是的，布鲁姆说。

Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn’t see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you’re listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It’s on account of the sounds it is.
数字就是这样。当你思考时，所有的音乐。二乘以二除以二分之一等于两倍一。振动：就是和弦。一加二加六等于七。用数字杂耍做任何你喜欢的事情。总是发现这个等于那个。墓地墙下的对称。他没有看到我的哀悼。冷酷无情：一切都是为了他自己的直觉。博物馆数学。你认为你正在聆听空灵的声音。但假设你这样说：玛莎，七乘九减 x 是三万五千。跌得很平。这是因为它的声音。

Instance he’s playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you’re in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.
比如说他现在正在玩。即兴创作。可能是你喜欢的，直到你听到这些话。想听清楚。难的。开始时一切顺利：然后听到和弦有点偏离：感觉有点迷失。进出麻袋、越过桶、穿过铁丝网、进行障碍赛。时间造就曲调。你的心情问题。仍然很高兴听到。除了音阶的上下变化，女孩们还在学习。两人是隔壁邻居。应该为此发明虚拟钢琴。 Blumenlied是我给她买的。名字。慢慢地演奏，一个女孩，晚上我回家，那个女孩。塞西莉亚街附近马厩的门。米莉没有味道。我是说，奇怪是因为我们俩。

Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.
秃聋帕特带来了相当平的垫墨。用墨水笔拍定相当平坦的垫。帕特接过盘子菜刀叉。帕特去了。

It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.
这是迪达勒斯先生对本说的唯一语言。当他还是个孩子的时候，他就在林加贝拉、克罗斯黑文、林加贝拉听到他们唱船歌。皇后镇港口停满了意大利船只。你知道，本，戴着防震帽在月光下散步。混合他们的声音。天啊，这样的音乐，本。小时候听过。十字林加贝拉天堂月歌。

Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.
他拿开发酸的烟斗，把一只手放在嘴唇旁边，发出月光夜呼声，清晰地来自近处，来自远方的呼唤，回应着。

Down the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom’s, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking …
布卢姆的另一只眼睛，沿着他的弗里曼警棍的边缘，扫视着我在哪里看到的。卡兰、科尔曼、迪格纳姆·帕特里克。嘿嘿！嘿嘿！福塞特。啊哈！只是我正在寻找……

Hope he’s not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman. Can’t see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline imposs. To write today.
希望他看起来没有像老鼠一样可爱。他展开了他的弗里曼。现在看不到。记住写希腊语 ees。布卢姆下降了，布卢穆尔：亲爱的先生。亲爱的亨利写道: 亲爱的麦迪。得到你的许可和流程。我放了地狱吗？一些麻子或其他。这是完全不可能的。下划线强制。今天要写。

Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought.
忍受这个。无聊的布鲁姆轻轻地敲着手鼓，我只是在帕特带来的平垫上反射手指。

A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz’ porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.
一辆三百二十四号出租汽车，司机是巴顿·詹姆斯，来自唐尼布鲁克和谐大道一号，车上坐着一位年轻绅士，穿着时髦的靛蓝色哔叽西装，由乔治·罗伯特·梅西亚斯制作，乔治·罗伯特·梅西亚斯是一位裁缝和裁剪师。五号伊甸园码头，戴着一顶很考究的草帽，是大不伦瑞克街一号的约翰·普拉斯托买的，帽匠。呃？这是叮叮当当的叮当声。在德卢加茨的猪肉店旁，阿根达斯的明亮管子正在小跑，一匹英勇的臀部母马。

She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell she brought.
她度过了一段非常美好的时光。看看她带来的可爱贝壳。

To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.
在酒吧的尽头，她轻轻地向他举着尖刺而蜿蜒的海角，他，乔治·利德威尔，律师，可能会听到。

—Listen! she bade him.
-听！她吩咐他。

Under Tom Kernan’s ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. Scoundrel, said he, You’ll sing no more lovesongs. He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.
在汤姆·克南（Tom Kernan）的基调词下，伴奏者缓慢地编织着音乐。真实的事实。沃尔特·巴蒂如何失声。好吧，先生，丈夫掐住了他的喉咙。恶棍，他说，你不会再唱情歌了。他做到了，相信，汤姆先生。鲍勃·考利负责编织。男高音获得口碑。考利躺了回去。

Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.
啊，现在他听到了，她把它放在他耳边。听到！他听到。

Wonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. To hear.
精彩的。她把它据为己有。透过筛过的光线，淡金色形成鲜明对比。听到。

Tap.
轻敲。

Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.
布鲁姆穿过吧门，看到一枚贝壳抵在了他们的耳边。他听到的声音更微弱，就像他们听到的那样，每个人单独为自己，然后彼此为对方，听到海浪的拍打声，大声，无声的咆哮。

Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.
青铜色和疲倦的金色，近处、远处，他们都在倾听。

Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn’t forget. Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.
她的耳朵也是一个贝壳，那里有窥视的耳垂。去过海边。可爱的海边女孩。皮肤晒黑了。应该先涂上冷霜使它变成棕色。涂黄油的吐司。哦，那乳液一定不能忘记。她的嘴附近发烧。你的头脑很简单。头发编成辫子：用海藻贝壳。为什么他们用海藻毛遮住耳朵？而突厥人的嘴，为什么呢？她的目光落在床单上。面纱。找到进入的路。一个山洞。除公务外不得入内。

The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in the ear sometimes. Well, it’s a sea. Corpuscle islands.
他们认为他们听到的是大海。唱歌。一声怒吼。就是血。有时在耳朵里腌一下。嗯，这是一片海。体岛。

Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.
真的很棒。如此独特。再次。乔治·利德威尔忍住它的低语，听着：然后轻轻地把它放在一边。

—What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.
——汹涌的海浪在说什么？他微笑着问她。

Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.

From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce’s head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.
米娜小姐从被遗弃的贝壳里滑向等待着的酒杯。不，她并不孤单，狡猾的杜斯小姐的头脑让利德韦尔先生知道。踏着月光漫步海边。不，并不孤单。和谁一起？她堂堂正正地回答：和一位绅士朋友。

Bob Cowley’s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.
鲍勃·考利闪烁的手指再次演奏出高音。楼主有先见之明。一点时间。长约翰.大本钟。他轻轻地为绊倒的、弓着背、微笑着的女士们以及她们的英勇绅士朋友们演奏了一首轻快、叮当作响的小节。一：一，一，一，一，一：二，一，三，四。

Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don’t crow, snakes hissss. There’s music everywhere. Ruttledge’s door: ee creaking. No, that’s noise. Minuet of Don Giovanni he’s playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.
大海、风、树叶、雷声、流水、牛叫、牛市、公鸡、母鸡不打鸣，蛇嘶嘶作响。到处都有音乐。拉特利奇的门：吱吱作响。不，那是噪音。他现在正在演奏《唐璜》的小步舞曲。各种各样的宫廷礼服在城堡的房间里跳舞。苦难。外面的农民。绿色饥饿的面孔正在吃着坞叶。很好。看：看，看，看，看，看：你看我们。

That’s joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.
我能感受到这种快乐。从来没有写过。为什么？我的快乐是另一种快乐。但两者都是快乐的。是的，一定是快乐。仅仅音乐的事实就表明了你是这样的。常常以为她情绪低落，直到她开始轻快地唱歌。那么就知道了。

M’Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can’t manage men’s intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I’m warm, dark, open. Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.
麦考伊手提箱。我的妻子和你的妻子。尖叫的猫。犹如撕裂丝绸。她说话时的舌头就像风箱的拍子。他们无法管理男人的间歇时间。他们的声音也有差距。充满我。我温暖、黑暗、开放。莫莉是同性恋：Mercadante。我把耳朵贴在墙上听。想要一个能送货的女人。

Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.
慢跑吉格慢跑停止了。花花公子博伊兰的花花公子棕褐色鞋子袜子天蓝色时钟来到地球。

O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt’s, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.
哦，看我们就是这样！室内乐。可以用这个来打个双关语。这是我在她的时候经常想到的一种音乐。声学就是这样。叮当响。空船发出的噪音最多。由于声学原理，共振随着水的重量等于落水定律而变化。就像李斯特的狂想曲一样，匈牙利语，吉卜赛人的眼睛。珍珠。滴。雨。嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟。嘶嘶声。现在。也许现在。前。

One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.
一个敲门，一个敲门，他用卡拉卡拉卡拉的公鸡用响亮而自豪的门环敲击了保罗·德科克。公鸡。

Bob Cowley’s outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.
鲍勃·考利伸出的爪子抓住了黑色深沉的和弦。

Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He’s on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.
布鲁姆王子必须去告诉里奇王子。不，里奇说。是的，必须的。某处有钱。他正在经历一场令人腰痛的狂欢。很多？他看到听到唇语。一和九。佩妮给你自己。这里。给他两便士小费。聋了，烦了。但也许他的妻子和家人正在等待，等待帕蒂回家。嘿嘿嘿嘿。聋子在等待时等待。

But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.
可是等等。但听。和弦黑暗。卢古古古布里斯。低的。黑暗中土的一个山洞里。嵌入矿石。肿块音乐。

The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth’s fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.
黑暗时代的声音，不爱的声音，大地的疲倦，使人感到沉重而痛苦，从远方，从白山传来，呼唤着善良和真诚的人。他寻找的牧师。他会和他说一句话。

Tap.
轻敲。

Ben Dollard’s voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships’ chandler’s business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships’ lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.
本·多拉德的声音。基本桶音。尽自己最大的能力说出来。无人月光的广阔沼泽发出嘎嘎声。其他的衰落。他曾经做过大船钱德勒的生意。记住：松香绳子，船上的灯笼。没能调到一万英镑。现在在伊维家里。隔间号码如此这般。第一名巴斯为他做到了这一点。

The priest’s at home. A false priest’s servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.
牧师在家。一个假祭司的仆人欢迎他。介入。圣父。带着弓箭的叛徒仆人。和弦的曲调。

Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.
毁了他们。毁掉他们的生活。然后为他们建造小隔间，在 Hushaby 结束他们的日子。催眠曲。去死吧，狗。小狗，去死吧。

The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.
警告的声音，庄严的警告，告诉他们年轻人已经进入了一个孤独的大厅，告诉他们他的脚步在那里是多么庄严，告诉他们阴暗的房间，穿着法衣的牧师坐着忏悔。

Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he’ll win in Answers, poets’ picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.
正派的灵魂。现在有点糊涂了。认为他会在诗人的图画谜题“答案”中获胜。我们递给您清晰的五英镑钞票。鸟坐在巢中孵化。他认为那是最后一位吟游诗人的歌谣。看看空白T恤什么家畜？开球冲刺是最勇敢的水手。他的好声音仍然存在。还没有太监带着他所有的财产。

Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.
听。布鲁姆听着。里奇·古尔丁听着。聋哑的帕特、秃头的帕特、尖尖的帕特在门口听着。和弦奏得更慢。

The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben’s contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God’s name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.
忏悔和悲伤的声音缓缓传来，经过修饰，颤抖着。本悔悟的胡子承认了这一点。他以多米尼的名字，以上帝的名义跪下。他把手拍在胸前，承认：我有罪。

Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine. Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.
又是拉丁语。这就像黏鸟胶一样固定住它们。牧师拿着这些妇女的圣餐集。太平间里的小伙子，棺材或咖啡，corpusnomine。想知道那只老鼠现在在哪里。刮。

Tap.
轻敲。

They listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.
他们听了。大啤酒杯和肯尼迪小姐。乔治·利德韦尔，眼睑富有表现力，饱满的缎子。克南。斯。

The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three times. You bitch’s bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother’s rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.
悲伤的叹息声唱了起来。他的罪过。自复活节以来，他已经咒骂了三遍。你这个混蛋的屁股。有一次，在弥撒时间，他去玩耍了。有一次他经过教堂墓地时，并没有为母亲的安息祈祷。一个男孩。一个粗壮的男孩。

Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn’t half know I’m. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.
古铜一边听着，一边借着啤酒的拉力凝视着远处。深情地。一半不知道我是。莫莉很擅长看到任何人在看。

Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face? They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.
青铜远远地看着旁边。镜子在那里。这是她最好看的一面吗？他们总是知道。敲门。最后一个提示。

Cockcarracarra.
科卡拉卡拉。

What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That’s music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin’s name.
当他们听到音乐时会想什么？捕捉响尾蛇的方法。晚上迈克尔·冈恩给了我们盒子。调整。波斯国王最喜欢这个。让他想起甜蜜的家。还用窗帘擦了擦鼻子。也许定制他的国家。那也是音乐。并不像听起来那么糟糕。图特林。黄铜通过上树干发出驴叫声。低音提琴手无助，身体两侧有伤口。木管乐器哞哞叫着牛。半大张开的鳄鱼音乐有下巴。木管乐器就像古德温的名字。

She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa’s. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!
她看起来很好。她穿着低胸的藏红花连衣裙，展示着随身物品。当她弯腰问问题时，丁香的呼吸总是充满戏剧性。告诉她斯宾诺莎在可怜的爸爸的书中所说的话。催眠，聆听。眼睛就是这样的。她弯下了腰。那个穿着礼服的小伙子用他的歌剧镜低头凝视着她，尽管他的价值很高。美妙的音乐你必须听两遍。自然女子半看。上帝为乡下人创造了曲调。遇见了他的长矛软管。哲学。岩石啊！

All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.
全没了。都倒下了。在他父亲罗斯的围攻中，在戈里，他所有的兄弟都阵亡了。对于韦克斯福德来说，我们是韦克斯福德的孩子，他会的。最后是他的名字和种族。

I too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?
我也。我的最后一场比赛。米莉年轻的学生。好吧，也许是我的错。没有儿子。鲁迪.现在太晚了。或者如果没有？如果不？如果还在的话？

He bore no hate.
他没有仇恨。

Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?
恨。爱。这些是名字。鲁迪.很快我就老了。大本钟的声音展开了。里奇·古尔丁用洪亮的声音对即将老去的布鲁姆说道，他的苍白中泛起红晕。但什么时候年轻过呢？

Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.
爱尔兰现在来了。我的国家高于国王。她在听。谁害怕谈论十九四？是时候推推搡搡了。看够了。

Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl’s romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy’s owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.
布卢姆看起来很不幸地离开了。起身去杀人：每周十八鲍勃。研究员们掏出了这笔钱。想要保持警惕。那些女孩，那些可爱的。悲伤的海浪边。歌舞女郎的浪漫。宣读了违反承诺的信件。来自 Chickabiddy 自己的 Mumpsypum。法庭上一片笑声。亨利.我从来没有签署过。你这个可爱的名字。

Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.
音乐、空气和言语都变得低沉。然后就赶紧了。假牧师把士兵从袈裟里扒下来。一名自耕农船长。他们都熟记于心。他们渴望的刺激。自耕农帽。

Tap. Tap.
轻敲。轻敲。

Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.
她听得很兴奋，同情地弯下腰来听。

Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn’t see. They want it. Not too much polite. That’s why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.
面无表情。处女应该说：或者只用手指。在上面写一些东西：页。如果不是，他们会怎样？衰落，绝望。让他们保持年轻。连自己都佩服。看。玩弄她。吹唇。白衣女子身躯，长笛生机。轻轻地吹。大声。三个洞，都是女人。女神我没看到。他们想要它。不太有礼貌。这就是他得到它们的原因。口袋里有黄金，脸上有黄铜。说些什么。让她听见。一起看去看看。无词歌曲。莫莉，那个鲁莽的男孩。她知道他的意思是猴子病了。或者因为很喜欢西班牙人。也可以这样理解动物。所罗门做到了。大自然的恩赐。

Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?
腹语。我的嘴唇闭上了。在我的肚子里思考。什么？

Will? You? I. Want. You. To.
将要？你？我想。你。到。

With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch’s bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour’s your time to live, your last.
农夫粗鲁地嘶哑地咒骂着，中风的母狗的私生子膨胀了。孩子，这是个好主意。一小时是你的生命，也是你的最后一个小时。

Tap. Tap.
轻敲。轻敲。

Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she’s over. Because their wombs.
现在就激动吧。他们感到遗憾。为那些想死的烈士擦去眼泪。为一切将死的事物，为一切诞生的事物。可怜的普尔弗伊夫人。希望她已经结束了。因为他们的子宫。

A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.
女人眼球的子宫里的液体凝视着睫毛栅栏下，平静地倾听着。当她不说话时，看到真正美丽的眼睛。就在那边的河边。每当胸部缓慢起伏（她起伏的余烬）时，红玫瑰就会慢慢地沉下去。心跳：她的呼吸：呼吸就是生命。所有微小的蕨叶都像银线一样颤抖。

But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.
但看。明亮的星星黯淡了。噢，玫瑰！卡斯蒂利亚。早晨。哈。利德威尔。为他则不为。痴情了。我喜欢？不过从这里看她。软木塞爆开，啤酒泡沫四溅，空瓶成堆。

On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.
莉迪亚的手放在光滑突出的啤酒拉手上，轻轻地、软软地，把它交给我的手。所有人都沉浸在对作物的怜悯之中。来来回回：在抛光的旋钮上（她认识他的眼睛，我的眼睛，她的眼睛），她的拇指和手指怜悯地经过：经过，休息，轻轻地触摸，然后如此顺利地滑动，慢慢地向下，一种凉爽的感觉。坚固的白色珐琅警棍从滑环中伸出。

With a cock with a carra.
带着卡拉的公鸡。

By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.
聋哑的帕特在门口竖起耳朵，布鲁姆走过了。

At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.
那个年轻人在日内瓦军营去世了。他的尸体安放在通道上。多洛尔！哦，他多洛雷斯！悲痛的吟唱声唤起了悲伤的祈祷。

By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.
借着玫瑰，借着缎子般的怀抱，借着爱抚的手，借着泔水，借着空瓶，借着爆裂的软木塞，在行进中问候，经过眼睛和银发，深海阴影中的古铜色和淡金色，布卢姆走了，柔软的布卢姆，我感到如此孤独的布卢姆。

为他祈祷，多拉德的低音祈祷。汝等安然听者。呼吸祈祷，流下眼泪，好人，好人。他就是那个邋遢的男孩。

Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.
奥蒙德走廊里，吓人的靴子小男孩布卢姆听到了布拉沃的咆哮声和咆哮声，胖子拍打着后背，他们的靴子都在踩踏，靴子不是男孩的靴子。总合唱结束，用泔水把它冲下去。很高兴我避开了。

盲目地走着，敲着敲着，敲着路边石，敲着，敲着。

Cowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren’t budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.
考利，他自己都惊呆了：有点醉了。最好只让一个男人和一个女仆的一半。实例爱好者。所有的耳朵。不损失半个八分音符。眼睛闭上。及时点头。多蒂。你不敢让步。严禁思考。总是在谈论商店。摆弄笔记。

All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows.

一切都是一种尝试交谈。当它停止时会令人不快，因为你永远不知道确切的情况。加德纳街的管风琴。老格林每年五十英镑。阁楼里很奇怪，独自一人，有停靠点、锁和钥匙。整天坐在风琴前。蒙德一连几个小时，自言自语，或跟另一个吹着风箱的家伙说话。愤怒地咆哮，然后尖声咒骂（想要在他身上塞上棉絮或什么东西，不，她哭了），然后突然间一阵微弱的风声。

Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom’s little wee.

我必须真的。呵呵。现在，如果我在宴会上这样做。只是波斯国王的习俗问题。呼吸祈祷，滴下眼泪。尽管如此，他一定是有点天生没有看出这是一顶自耕农帽子。闷闷不乐。想知道坟墓里那个穿着棕色马金的家伙是谁。噢，巷子里的妓女！

A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane.

O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.
白天，一个戴着黑色水手草草帽、浑身臭气的妓女沿着码头神情呆滞地朝布卢姆先生走来。当他第一次看到这种可爱的形状时？是的。我感到很孤独。巷子里湿漉漉的夜晚。喇叭。谁有？嘿嘿，她看见了。这里偏离了她的节奏。她是什么？希望她。嘘！任何洗漱的机会。认识莫莉。把我打扮得漂漂亮亮的。身着棕色服装的粗壮女士确实和你在一起。让你远离中风，那个。我们在约会时知道我们永远不会，几乎永远不会。太亲爱了，离家太近了，甜蜜的家。她看见我了，是吗？白天看起来很害怕。脸像浸。该死的她。哦，好吧，她必须像其他人一样生活。看看这里。

In Lionel Marks’s antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don’t want it. That’s what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell.

I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.
我当时正和民主党议员的老特洛伊在阿伯山的拐角处打发时间，该死的，但是一场血腥的横扫发生了，他差点把他的装备射进我的眼睛。我转身让他承受我舌头的重量，这时我应该看到谁沿着斯托尼·巴特尔躲闪，只有乔·海因斯。

—Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?
——瞧，乔，我说。你吹得怎么样？你看到那个该死的扫烟囱的人差点用刷子把我的眼睛挖出来吗？

—Soot’s luck, says Joe. Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?
——乔说，这真是运气。和你说话的老家伙是谁？

—Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I’m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.
——我说，老特洛伊在部队里。我有两个想法，不应该让那个用扫帚和梯子堵塞大道的家伙负责。

—What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.
——你在这些部件周围做什么？乔说。

—Devil a much, says I. There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.
——太魔鬼了，我说。在鸡肉巷拐角处的驻军教堂旁边，有一个该死的大狡猾的小偷——老特洛伊只是让我对他感到不满——拿起任何上帝数量的茶和糖，只要付三个鲍勃的钱周说，他在海茨伯里街附近的县里有一个农场，名叫摩西·赫尔佐格（Moses Herzog）。

—Circumcised? says Joe.
——割礼了？乔说。

—Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I’m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a penny out of him.
——哎呀，我说。有点离题了。一位名叫杰拉蒂的老水管工。过去两周我一直紧抓着他的要求，却无法从他那里得到一分钱。

—That the lay you’re on now? says Joe.
——那是你现在所处的位置吗？乔说。

—Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I’ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?
——哎呀，我说。那些强大的人是如何倒下的！坏账和呆账的追收人。但这是你在一天的步行中会遇到的最臭名昭著的血腥强盗，他脸上的麻子可以容纳一场雨。 “告诉他，”他说，“我敢打赌，”他说，“我敢打赌他再派你来这里，或者如果他这样做，”他说，“我会把他传唤到法庭，所以我会的，因为交易没有执照。他把自己塞得满满的，直到他快要爆炸了。天哪，我不得不嘲笑那个小犹太人脱掉衬衫。他给我喝茶。他吃了我的糖。因为他不付钱给我？

—What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.

——关于口蹄疫，乔说，牛贩子。我想对公民说实话。

So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn’t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.
于是我们就在莱恩霍尔军营和法院后面闲逛，谈论一件事或另一件事。乔是个正派的家伙，当他拥有它时，但可以肯定的是，他从未拥有过它。天哪，我无法忘记那个该死的狡猾的杰拉蒂，那个光天化日之下的强盗。他说，这是无证交易。

In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.
在伊尼斯费尔集市上有一片土地，神圣米尚的土地。那里矗立着一座瞭望塔，远远地就能看到人们。那里长眠着那些威名显赫的死者，就像生前一样，是声名显赫的战士和王子。这是一片宜人的土地，河水潺潺，鱼儿多的溪流中游动着鲂鱼、鲽鱼、蟑螂、大比目鱼、黑线鳕、灰鳕鱼、鲽鱼、鲽鱼、比目鱼、狭鳕和混合粗鱼。一般来说，水王国的其他居民不胜枚举。在西边和东边的微风中，高大的树木向不同的方向摇曳着它们一流的叶子，飘逸的悬铃木、黎巴嫩雪松、高大的梧桐树、优生桉树和其他树木世界的装饰品，该地区与该地区有着密切的关系。供应充足。可爱的姑娘们坐在可爱的树根附近，唱着最可爱的歌曲，同时玩弄各种可爱的物体，例如金锭，银鱼，鲱鱼，鳗鱼，鳕鱼，鱼架，紫色的海石和顽皮的昆虫。英雄们从远方远航来吸引他们，从埃布拉纳到斯利夫马吉，无拘无束的明斯特和公正而光滑的伦斯特康诺赫特和克鲁阿汉的土地和辉煌的阿马和博伊尔的高贵地区的无与伦比的王子，王子，国王的儿子。

And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.
那里矗立着一座闪闪发光的宫殿，水手们乘着专门为此目的而建造的小船穿越广阔的大海，看到了它水晶闪闪发光的屋顶，所有的牛群、肥畜和那片土地上的初熟果实都来到了那里，因为奥康奈尔·菲茨西蒙对它们造成了伤害，酋长是酋长的后裔。巨大的马车运来了田里的鹅肉、花椰菜、菠菜、菠萝块、仰光豆、西红柿、无花果鼓、瑞典钻、球形土豆和虹彩羽衣甘蓝、约克甘蓝和萨沃伊甘蓝，以及托盘里的洋葱、地球上的珍珠、小篮子里的蘑菇、奶油冻骨髓、肥荠菜、野豌豆、油菜、红、绿、黄、棕、甜、大、苦、成熟的带糖的苹果、草莓片、筛子的醋栗、果肉、果肉和草莓适合王子和手杖上的覆盆子。

I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
我敢于他，他说，而且我敢于双倍地敢于他。出来吧，杰拉蒂，你这个臭名昭著的血腥强盗！

And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.
无数的领头羊、红毛母羊、长毛公羊、羔羊、短茬鹅、中型公牛、咆哮的母马、无角小牛、长林羊、储羊、卡夫的优质跳马、淘汰的母猪、培根猪以及各种不同品种的品质优良的猪、安格斯小母牛、波利公牛，以及优质的奶牛和牛肉：羊和猪的践踏声、咯咯声、咆哮声、低鸣声、咩咩声、咆哮声、隆隆声、咕噜声、咀嚼声、咀嚼声不绝于耳。来自拉斯克、拉什和卡里克迈恩斯牧场的重蹄牛，来自托蒙德溪流的山谷，来自难以接近、气势雄伟、深不可测的香农的姆吉利卡迪山谷，来自基尔种族所在地的缓坡，它们的乳房膨胀起来。大量的牛奶、黄油、奶酪凝乳酶、农夫的冰激凌、羊肉、玉米饼干和长方形鸡蛋，数百个，大小不一，玛瑙色暗褐色。

So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.
于是我们拐进了巴尼·基尔南酒吧，果然，那个公民在角落里和那个该死的肮脏杂种加里欧文（Garryowen）进行了一场精彩的交谈，而他则等待着天上掉下来的饮料。

—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.
——我说，他就在那里，在他的光荣洞里，在他的草坪和他的文件堆里，为这项事业而努力。

The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.
这该死的杂种狗从他身上放出一只松鸡会让你毛骨悚然。如果有人要夺走那只该死的狗的生命，那就是一种仁慈的下士行为。有人告诉我，他吃了桑特里一名警察的大部分马裤，这名警察有一次带着一张关于执照的蓝纸过来。

—Stand and deliver, says he.
——站起来交付，他说。

—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
——没关系，公民，乔说。朋友们在这里。

—Pass, friends, says he.
——通过吧，朋友们，他说。

Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
然后他用手揉了揉眼睛，说道：

—What’s your opinion of the times?
——你对时代有什么看法？

Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.
做山上的拉帕雷和罗里。但是，天哪，乔能应付这个场合。

—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.
——我认为市场正在上涨，他一边说，一边把手滑下叉子。

So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
于是，这位公民用爪子拍了一下膝盖，说道：

—Foreign wars is the cause of it.
——原因是对外战争。

And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
乔把拇指插在口袋里说道：

—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.
——这是俄罗斯人想要的暴政。

—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.
——哎呀，交出你该死的编码吧，乔，我说。我很渴，我不会卖半个克朗。

—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.
——给它起个名字吧，公民，乔说。

—Wine of the country, says he.
——这个国家的葡萄酒，他说。

—What’s yours? says Joe.
-你的是啥呢？乔说。

—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
——我说，同上，麦克安斯佩。

—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how’s the old heart, citizen? says he.
——三品脱，特里，乔说。公民，老心怎么样？他说。

—Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
——再好不过了，一个角色，他说。什么加里？我们会赢吗？呃？

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
说完，他抓住了那该死的旧拖车的颈背，天哪，他差点把他掐死了。

The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.
坐在圆塔脚下一块大石头上的人物是一位宽肩、深胸、四肢粗壮、红发、雀斑、胡须、宽嘴、大鼻子、长头、低声、赤膝、粗壮的手、毛茸茸的脸、红脸、强健臂膀的英雄。他从肩膀到肩膀测量了好几处，他岩石般的膝盖和身体其他可见的地方都覆盖着长满的黄褐色多刺毛发，其颜色和韧性类似于山金雀花（Ulex Europeus）。宽翅鼻孔中伸出同样黄褐色的刚毛，鼻孔如此宽敞，以至于田百灵很容易在它们的洞穴般的黑暗中安住了自己的巢。那双眼睛有一颗大花椰菜那么大，泪水和微笑都在争先恐后地控制着。一股强大的温热气息，从他口中的深渊里，每隔一段时间就发出一股强大的温热气息，有节奏的共鸣，他那强大心脏的洪亮有力的回响，轰隆作响，轰鸣着大地、高塔之巅，以及更加巍峨的洞壁。振动和颤抖。

He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.
他穿着一件新近剥皮的无袖长袍，长及膝盖，是一条宽松的苏格兰短裙，中间用一条稻草和灯心草编成的腰带束住。里面他穿了几条鹿皮，粗略地用羊肠线缝制而成。他的下肢穿着染成地衣紫色的巴尔布里根高筒皮鞋，脚上穿着盐牛皮布洛克鞋，上面系着同一头野兽的气管。他的腰带上挂着一排海石，随着他那不祥的身躯的每一个动作而发出叮当作响的声音，上面用粗鲁但引人注目的艺术雕刻着许多爱尔兰古代英雄和女英雄的部落形象，库丘林，百场战斗的康恩，九名人质的尼尔, 金科拉的布莱恩、阿德里·玛拉基、阿特·麦克穆拉、谢恩·奥尼尔、约翰·墨菲神父、欧文·罗伊、帕特里克·萨斯菲尔德、雷德·休·奥唐纳、雷德·吉姆·麦克德莫特、索加斯·伊奥根·奥格罗尼、迈克尔·德怀尔、弗朗西·希金斯、亨利乔伊·麦克拉肯、歌利亚、霍勒斯·惠特利、托马斯·康内夫、佩格·沃芬顿、乡村铁匠、月光船长、博伊考特船长、但丁·阿利吉耶里、克里斯托弗·哥伦布、S.弗萨、S.布伦丹、麦克马洪元帅、查理曼、西奥博尔德·沃尔夫·托恩、马卡比之母、最后的莫希干人、卡斯蒂利亚的玫瑰、戈尔韦的男人、在蒙特卡洛破产的男人、间隙中的男人、没有做到的女人、本杰明·富兰克林、拿破仑·波拿巴、约翰·L·沙利文、克利奥帕特拉、萨弗宁·迪利什、朱利叶斯·凯撒、帕拉塞尔苏斯、托马斯·利普顿爵士、威廉·泰尔、米开朗基罗·海耶斯、穆罕默德、拉美莫尔的新娘、隐士彼得、包装工彼得、达克·罗莎琳、帕特里克·W· 莎士比亚、布赖恩·孔子、默塔格·古腾堡、帕特里西奥·委拉斯开兹、尼莫船长、特里斯坦和伊索尔德、第一任威尔士亲王、托马斯·库克父子、勇敢的士兵男孩、阿拉·纳·波格、迪克·特平、路德维希·贝多芬、科琳·鲍恩、瓦德勒·希利、安格斯·库迪、多莉·芒特、西德尼·帕拉德、本·霍斯、瓦伦丁·格雷特雷克斯、亚当和夏娃、亚瑟·韦尔斯利、老大克罗克、希罗多德、巨人杀手杰克、释迦牟尼、戈黛娃夫人、基拉尼百合、邪眼巴洛尔、示巴女王、阿基·内格尔、乔·内格尔、亚历山德罗·沃尔塔、耶利米·奥多诺万·罗萨、唐·菲利普·奥沙利文·贝尔。他身旁放着一根用尖头花岗岩制成的长矛，而他的脚下则躺着一只来自犬类部落的野蛮动物，它的喘息声表明他正陷入不安的睡眠，而他的主人不时压抑的嘶哑的咆哮和痉挛性的动作证实了这一假设。通过用旧石器时代的石头粗制而成的强力棍棒进行镇静打击。

So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I’m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
不管怎样，特里带来了乔站着的三品脱啤酒，当我看到他拿出一英镑时，我的视线几乎离开了我的视线，就像我告诉你的那样。一个英俊的君主。

—And there’s more where that came from, says he.
——他说，还有更多的来源。

—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
——乔，你抢了穷人的钱箱吗？我说。

—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. ‘Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.
——我额头冒汗，乔说。 “正是那位谨慎的成员让我喘不过气来。

—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
——在遇见你之前，我就见过他了，我一边说，一边在皮尔巷和希腊街上倾斜地走来走去，他用鳕鱼般的眼睛数着鱼的内脏。

Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour? O’Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the prudent soul.
谁穿着黑貂盔甲穿过米尚的土地？奥布卢姆，罗里的儿子：就是他。罗里的儿子不受恐惧影响：他有着谨慎的灵魂。

—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I’ll thank you and the marriages.
——给王子街的老妇人，公民说，补贴机关。房子地板上的誓约派对。看看这块该死的破布，他说。看看这个，他说。爱尔兰独立报，如果你愿意的话，由帕内尔创立，是工人的朋友。聆听爱尔兰人的出生和死亡，一切都是为了爱尔兰独立，我会感谢你和婚姻。

And he starts reading them out:
他开始读出它们：

—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How’s that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow …
—戈登，巴恩菲尔德新月，埃克塞特；海上圣安妮伊夫利的雷德梅恩：威廉·T·雷德梅恩的妻子，有一个儿子。怎么样，嗯？赖特和弗林特、文森特和吉列致罗莎·马里恩和已故的乔治·阿尔弗雷德·吉列的女儿，地址：179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington，由伍斯特院长福雷斯特博士尊敬。呃？死亡人数。布里斯托，在伦敦白厅巷：卡尔、斯托克·纽因顿，研究胃炎和心脏病：科伯恩，在切普斯托护城河屋……

—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
——乔说，我从痛苦的经历中认识了那个人。

—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
——科伯恩。迪姆西，大卫·迪姆西的妻子，已故海军部：米勒，托特纳姆，八十五岁：威尔士，6月12日，伊莎贝拉·海伦，利物浦坎宁街35号。对于一家全国性媒体来说怎么样，呃，我的棕色儿子！班特里的打工者马丁·墨菲 (Martin Murphy) 怎么样？

—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.
——啊，好吧，乔一边说，一边递上酒。感谢上帝，他们让我们有了开始。喝这个吧，公民。

—I will, says he, honourable person.
——我会的，他说，可敬的人。

—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
——健康，乔，我说。一切都以表格形式呈现。

Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
啊!噢！别说话！我因为缺那品脱而发霉了。向上帝宣告，我能听到它“咔哒”一声击中我的胃。

And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.
看啊，当他们痛饮欢乐之杯时，一位神明使者迅速走了进来，他的容光焕发，如同天眼，一位英俊的青年，在他身后走过一位步态和面容高贵的长老，手上拿着神圣的法律卷轴，和他在一起。他的夫人是一位有着无与伦比的血统的女士，是她的种族中最美丽的。

Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.
小阿尔夫·伯根从门外突然闯进来，躲在巴尼的后面，笑得挤在一起。而坐在我没见过的角落里打呼噜、喝醉了、对世界视而不见的人只有鲍勃·多兰。我不知道发生了什么事，阿尔夫一直在门外打手势。天哪，那只是那个该死的老马裤丹尼斯·布林穿着浴鞋，腋下夹着两本该死的大书，他的妻子急忙跟在他后面，不幸的可怜女人，像狮子狗一样小跑。我以为阿尔夫会分裂。

—Look at him, says he. Breen. He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li …
——看看他，他说。布林。他带着一张有人用 U.p 寄给他的明信片在都柏林各处闲逛：上来去度假……

And he doubled up.
他加倍了。

—Take a what? says I.
——拿什么？我说。

—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
——诽谤诉讼，他说，赔偿一万英镑。

—O hell! says I.
——天啊！我说。

The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
那该死的杂种开始咆哮，看到有什么事情发生，会让你对上帝产生敬畏，但公民却踢了他的肋骨。

—Bi i dho husht, says he.
——Bi i dho husht，他说。

—Who? says Joe.
-WHO？乔说。

—Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff’s for a lark. O God, I’ve a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
——布林，阿尔夫说。他在约翰·亨利·门顿家，然后又去了科利斯和沃德家，然后汤姆·罗奇福德遇见了他，并把他送到副警长家去玩。天哪，我笑得好痛苦。 U.p：向上。这个高大的家伙给了他一个像过程一样好的眼睛，现在这个该死的老疯子正在格林街寻找一个G人。

—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
——约翰什么时候才能在芒特乔伊绞死那个家伙？乔说。

—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
——伯根，鲍勃·多兰醒来时说道。那是阿尔夫·贝尔根吗？

—Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John’s eye. U. p …
——是的，阿尔夫说。绞刑？等我给你看。特里，给我们一匹小马。这个该死的老傻瓜！一万英镑。你应该看到约翰的眼睛很长。向上 …

And he started laughing.
他开始大笑。

—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
——你在笑谁？鲍勃·多兰说。那是贝尔根吗？

—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
——快点，特里男孩，阿尔夫说。

Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
特伦斯·奥莱恩听到了他的话，立即给他端来了一杯充满泡沫的乌木麦芽啤酒，这是高贵的双胞胎兄弟邦吉维和邦加迪劳恩在他们神圣的酒窖里酿造的，狡猾得就像不死的勒达的儿子们一样。因为他们收集啤酒花和团块的多汁浆果，筛选、捣碎和酿造，他们将其与酸汁混合，并将葡萄汁带到神圣的火中，这些狡猾的兄弟，大桶的领主，日日夜夜不停地辛勤劳作。 。

Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
然后，您，侠义的特伦斯，按照出生的方式，递出了那甘露饮料，并将水晶杯献给了口渴的他，骑士精神的灵魂，美丽如仙。

But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
但他，奥伯根家族的年轻首领，在慷慨的行为上不甘示弱，因此以慷慨的姿态赠送了最昂贵的青铜试炼。其上浮雕着精美的铁制品，是一位皇家港口女王的图像，她是布伦瑞克家族的后裔，维多利亚，她的名字，她最杰出的陛下，承蒙大不列颠及爱尔兰联合王国和英国领土的上帝的恩典在大海彼岸，女王，信仰的捍卫者，印度皇后，甚至她，统治者，许多民族的胜利者，深受人们喜爱，因为从日出到日落，他们都认识并爱着她，苍白、深色、红润和埃塞俄比亚。

—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?
——那个该死的共济会会员在外面徘徊，说道，他在做什么？

—What’s that? says Joe.
-那是什么？乔说。

—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I’ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen’s letters. Look at here.
——给你，阿尔夫一边说着，一边把犀牛扔了出去。说到悬挂，我将向您展示一些您从未见过的东西。刽子手的信。看看这里。

So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.
于是他从口袋里掏出一捆信件和信封。

—Are you codding? says I.
——你在编码吗？我说。

—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
——诚实的印第安人，阿尔夫说。阅读它们。

So Joe took up the letters.
于是乔拿起了这些信。

—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
——你在笑谁？鲍勃·多兰说。

So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:
所以我看到当搬运工在他身上时，鲍勃是个奇怪的家伙，所以他说我只是为了说话：

—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?
——阿尔夫，威利·穆雷那段时间怎么样？

—I don’t know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that …
——我不知道，阿尔夫说，我刚才在卡佩尔街上看到他和帕迪·迪格南。只有我在后面跑……

—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
-你什么？乔一边说，一边扔掉信。与谁？

—With Dignam, says Alf.
——阿尔夫说，和迪格纳姆一起。

—Is it Paddy? says Joe.
——是帕迪吗？乔说。

—Yes, says Alf. Why?
——是的，阿尔夫说。为什么？

—Don’t you know he’s dead? says Joe.
——你不知道他死了吗？乔说。

—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
——帕迪·迪格纳姆死了！阿尔夫说。

—Ay, says Joe.
——嗯，乔说。

—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.
——当然，我是在不到五分钟前见过他的，阿尔夫说，语气平淡得像一根长矛。

—Who’s dead? says Bob Doran.
——谁死了？鲍勃·多兰说。

—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
——那么你就看到了他的鬼魂，乔说，上帝在我们和伤害之间。

—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five … What? … And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s … What? Dignam dead?
-什么？阿尔夫说。天啊，只有五个……什么？ ......威利·默里和他在一起，他们两个就在你叫他的地方附近......什么？迪格纳姆死了吗？

—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who’s talking about …?
——迪格纳姆呢？鲍勃·多兰说。谁在谈论……？

—Dead! says Alf. He’s no more dead than you are.
-死的！阿尔夫说。他并不比你更死。

—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.
——也许是这样，乔说。不管怎样，他们今天早上冒昧地埋葬了他。

—Paddy? says Alf.
-稻田？阿尔夫说。

—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
——嗯，乔说。他还清了大自然的债，愿上帝怜悯他。

—Good Christ! says Alf.
——天哪！阿尔夫说。

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
Begob，你可以说他大吃一惊。

In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn’t pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.
在黑暗中，人们感觉到灵性的双手在颤动，当密宗的祈祷被引导到适当的地方时，微弱但不断增加的红宝石光逐渐可见，以太分身的显现特别栩栩如生，因为从头顶和脸部。通讯是通过垂体以及从骶骨区域和太阳神经丛发出的橙火和猩红色射线实现的。当他的地球名字询问他在天堂世界的下落时，他说他现在正走在 pr lya 或回归的道路上，但仍然受到较低星体层某些嗜血实体的审判。在回答关于他在巨大鸿沟之外的第一感觉的问题时，他说，以前他在玻璃中看到的东西是黑暗的，但那些已经过去的人已经向他们敞开了原子发展的顶峰可能性。当被问及那里的生活是否与我们在肉体中的经历相似时，他说他现在从精神上更受青睐的人那里听说，他们的住所配备了所有现代家庭舒适设施，如塔拉法纳、阿拉瓦塔、哈塔卡尔达、瓦塔克拉萨特，并且最高的行者沉浸在最纯粹自然的狂欢之中。在要求了一夸脱酪乳后，这被送来了，显然缓解了压力。当被问及他是否有任何信息要传达给生者时，他劝告所有仍处于玛雅错误一边的人承认真正的道路，因为据天界圈子报道，火星和木星在公羊拥有力量的东角进行恶作剧。 。 然后被问及死者是否有什么特殊愿望，回答是：我们向你们致意，地球的朋友们，你们仍然在身体里。 Mind C. K. 并没有把它堆砌起来。经查明，该信息指的是 H. J. O’Neill 先生颇受欢迎的殡仪馆经理科尼利厄斯·凯莱赫 (Cornelius Kelleher) 先生，他是已故人士的私人朋友，负责安葬安排。出发前，他要求告诉他亲爱的儿子帕齐，他一直在寻找的另一只靴子目前在返回房间的马桶下，这双靴子应该送到卡伦家，只作为鞋跟的鞋底仍然很好。他表示，这极大地扰乱了他在其他地区的内心平静，并恳切地要求将他的愿望公之于众。

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.
已保证此事将得到处理，并表示对此感到满意。

He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
他离开了凡间：奥迪格纳姆，我们早晨的太阳。弗利特是他的脚踩在蕨菜上：眉毛浓密的帕特里克。哀号，班巴，用你的风；哀号，海洋啊，用你的旋风。

—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
——他又来了，这位公民凝视着窗外说道。

—Who? says I.
-WHO？我说。

—Bloom, says he. He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.
——布鲁姆，他说。在最后十分钟里，他一直在场上值班。

And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
而且，天啊，我看到他的生理机甲往里看了一眼，然后又滑开了。

Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
小阿尔夫被打得哇哇大哭。信仰，他是。

—Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
——天哪！他说。我可以发誓那是他。

And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:
鲍勃·多兰（Bob Doran）在他的民意调查中戴着帽子，他在喝醉酒时是都柏林最低级的流氓：

—Who said Christ is good?
——谁说基督是良善的？

—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.
——我请求你的防风草，阿尔夫说。

—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?
——鲍勃·多兰说，这是一位善良的基督，带走了可怜的小威利·迪格纳姆吗？

—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He’s over all his troubles.
——啊，好吧，阿尔夫说，试图掩饰这一点。他已经克服了所有的麻烦。

But Bob Doran shouts out of him.
但鲍勃·多兰却对他大喊大叫。

—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
——我说，他是个该死的恶棍，他要带走可怜的小威利·迪格纳姆。

Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.
特里下来给他眨了眨眼，让他保持安静，他们不想在一个受人尊敬的有执照的场所进行这种谈话。鲍勃·多兰 (Bob Doran) 开始为帕迪·迪格纳姆 (Paddy Dignam) 哭泣，正如你在场的那样。

—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
——最优秀的人，他抽泣着说，最优秀、最纯洁的性格。

The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
眼泪在你眼睛附近流淌。透过他那该死的帽子说话。更适合他回家去见他娶的梦游小母狗穆尼，管家的女儿，母亲在哈德威克街养了一个小孩子，班塔姆·里昂告诉我，它在凌晨两点停在那里，没有人。缝在她身上，暴露她的身体，向所有人开放，公平的领域，没有偏袒。

—The noblest, the truest, says he. And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.
——最高贵、最真实，他说。他走了，可怜的小威利，可怜的小帕迪·迪格纳姆。

And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.
他怀着悲痛和沉重的心情，为那道天光的熄灭而哭泣。

Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.
老加里欧文又开始对着门外挤来挤去的布鲁姆咆哮。

—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.
——进来吧，来吧，他不会吃你的，公民说。

So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.
于是，布鲁姆斜身进来，用他的鳕鱼眼睛盯着那只狗，他问特里是马丁·坎宁安在那里。

—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?
——哦，天啊，麦克翁，乔读着其中一封信说道。听听这个，好吗？

And he starts reading out one.
他开始朗读其中一篇。

7 Hunter Street, Liverpool.
利物浦亨特街 7 号。

To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.
致都柏林高级警长，都柏林。

Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged …
尊敬的先生，我请求为上述痛苦的案件提供服务，我于 1900 年 2 月 12 日在布特尔监狱绞死了乔·江恩 (Joe Gann)，然后我绞死了……

—Show us, Joe, says I.
——让我们看看，乔，我说。

— … private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when …
——……二等兵阿瑟·切斯（Arthur Chace）因在本顿维尔监狱（Pentonville）杀害杰西·蒂尔西特（Jessie Tilsit）的家禽而被杀，当时我是助手……

—Jesus, says I.
——天哪，我说。

— … Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith …
——……比林顿处决了可怕的凶手托德·史密斯……

The citizen made a grab at the letter.
那位公民抓住了这封信。

—Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.
——坚持住，乔说，我有一个特殊的技巧，一旦套上绞索，他就出不来，希望受到青睐，我留下来，尊敬的先生，我的条件是五个金尼。

H. RUMBOLD,
H.朗博尔德，

MASTER BARBER.
理发师大师。

—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
——这位公民说，他也是一个野蛮的、该死的野蛮人。

—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
——还有那个可怜虫的肮脏潦草的字迹，乔说。在这里，他说，把他们带入地狱，远离我的视线，阿尔夫。你好，布鲁姆，他说，你要吃什么？

So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar. Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.
于是他们开始争论这一点，布鲁姆说他不会，他不能，并原谅他没有冒犯之类的，然后他说好吧，他只是拿一支雪茄。天啊，他是个谨慎的成员，没有错。

—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
——告诉我们你最讨厌的人之一，特里，乔说。

And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.
阿尔夫告诉我们，有一个小伙子寄了一张哀悼卡，上面有黑色边框。

—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
——他说，他们都是理发师，来自黑人国家，他们会为了五英镑的首付和路费而绞死自己的父亲。

And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
他告诉我们，有两个人在下面等着，当他摔倒时，他们会把他的脚后跟拉下来，把他掐死，然后他们把绳子砍断，然后把碎片卖到几个鲍勃一个头骨。

In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.
他们是复仇的剃刀骑士，在黑暗的土地上等待着。他们抓住了它们致命的盘绕：是的，它们将任何犯下流血罪行的人引向埃里波斯，因为即使主如此说，我也决不会忍受它。

So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
所以他们开始谈论死刑，当然，布鲁姆说出了原因和原因以及所有的行业法则和老狗一直在闻他的气味我被告知那些犹太人确实有一种奇怪的气味来了关掉它们对于狗来说我不知道​​有什么威慑作用等等等等。

—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
——阿尔夫说，有一件事它没有威慑作用。

—What’s that? says Joe.
-那是什么？乔说。

—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.
——可怜的虫子的工具被吊起来了，阿尔夫说。

—That so? says Joe.
-这么？乔说。

—God’s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
——上帝的真理，阿尔夫说。我是从监狱长那里听说的

Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.
凯尔梅纳姆绞死了所向无敌的乔·布雷迪。他告诉我，当他们把他摔倒后砍倒时，它就像一根拨火棍一样立在他们脸上。

—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
——正如有人所说，乔说，死亡中的统治激情很强烈。

—That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the …
——这可以用科学来解释，布鲁姆说。这只是一种自然现象，你不明白吗，因为……

And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
然后他开始讲述关于现象和科学以及这种现象和另一种现象的令人惊叹的内容。

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.
杰出科学家 Luitpold Blumenduft 教授先生提供的医学证据表明，根据最受认可的医学传统，颈椎的瞬时骨折和随后的脊髓断裂将不可避免地在人类受试者中产生一种生殖器神经中枢的剧烈神经节刺激，从而导致海绵体的弹性毛孔迅速扩张，从而立即促进血液流向人体解剖学中称为阴茎或男性器官的部分导致了一种现象，该现象被学院称为“每头缩小的死关节病态的向上和向外的生殖性勃起”。

So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
所以，当然，公民只是在等待这个词的眨眼，他开始对无敌者、老守卫和六十七岁的人感到气愤，他害怕谈论九十八岁和乔和他一起谈论所有那些曾经的人。为了这个事业被绞死、拖走和流放，被军事法庭和一个新的爱尔兰以及新的这个、那个和另一个。谈到新爱尔兰，他应该去养一只新狗，所以他应该这样做。疥疮、贪婪的野蛮人到处乱嗅、打喷嚏、抓伤痂。然后他走到鲍勃·多兰那里，阿尔夫站在那儿，巴结着他能得到的东西。所以鲍勃·多兰当然开始和他一起做这个该死的傻事：

—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!
——把爪子给我们！伸出爪子，小狗！好老狗啊！把爪子放在这里！把爪子给我们！

Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.
阿拉，他的爪子该死的结局，阿尔夫试图阻止他从那该死的老狗顶上的血腥凳子上滚下来，他谈论着各种关于善良、纯种狗和聪明狗训练的胡言乱语：给你该死的点。然后他开始从他告诉特里带来的雅各布罐头底部刮出一些旧饼干。哎呀，他像穿旧靴子一样把它吞下去，舌头伸出一码长，想要更多。几乎把罐头和所有的东西都吃光了，饥饿的该死的杂种。

And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don’t you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
公民和布鲁姆就这一点争论不休，谢尔和沃尔夫·托恩兄弟在阿伯山，罗伯特·埃米特为你的国家而死，汤米·摩尔对萨拉·柯兰的触动，她远离了土地。当然，还有布鲁姆，他抽着廉价的雪茄，脸上带着猪油般的表情。现象！他娶的那个胖子是一个漂亮的老现象，背对着她就像一个球球。他们在城市武器店停下来的时候，小便者伯克告诉我，那里有一个老家伙，侄子的屁股已经裂开了，布卢姆试图让她柔软的一面玩贝齐克球，以便进来吃一点贝兹克球。按照她的意愿，周五不吃肉，因为老家伙总是敲打她的小龙虾，带这个笨蛋出去散步。有一次，他带着他在都柏林转了一圈，以神圣的农夫的名义，他从来没有哭过，直到他把他带回家，醉得像一只煮熟的猫头鹰，他说他这样做是为了教他酒精和鲱鱼的罪恶，如果三个女人几乎没有烤他，这是一个奇怪的故事，老故事，布鲁姆的妻子和经营旅馆的奥多德夫人。天哪，我不得不嘲笑小便伯克让他们嚼脂肪。布鲁姆和他在一起，但你没看到吗？但另一方面。当然，更多的是象征性的，据我所知，那个粗鲁的人在科普街的鲍尔酒馆、搅拌机酒馆里喝完这家该死的酒吧里的所有样品后，每周五次赤脚坐出租车回家。现象！

—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.
——对死者的记忆，公民拿起品脱玻璃杯，怒视着布鲁姆说道。

—Ay, ay, says Joe.
——哎，哎，乔说。

—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is …
——你没有明白我的意思，布鲁姆说。我的意思是 …

—Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.
——新芬党！这位公民说。新芬党啊！我们所爱的朋友就在我们身边，我们所恨的敌人就在我们面前。

The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentgeneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
最后的告别给我带来了极大的影响。远近的钟楼里，葬礼的死亡钟声不断地响起，而在阴暗的区域周围，一百个低沉的鼓声响起，不祥的警告声响起，中间夹杂着空洞的军械爆炸声。震耳欲聋的雷声和耀眼的闪电照亮了这可怕的景象，证明天上的大炮为这本来就可怕的景象增添了超自然的威严。倾盆大雨从愤怒的天空的闸门倾泻而下，落在聚集的群众头上，最少也有五十万人。都柏林警察局在首席专员的亲自指挥下，维持着广大人群的秩序，约克街的铜管乐器和簧片乐队用他们的黑布乐器，美妙地演奏了我们从摇篮起就喜爱的无与伦比的旋律，以此打发中间的时间。斯佩兰萨忧伤的缪斯。为了让我们的乡村同胞感到舒适，我们提供了专门的快速旅行火车和软垫拖车，他们有大量的队伍。最受欢迎的都柏林街头歌手 L-n-h-n 和 M-ll-g-n 引起了极大的娱乐，他们以他们一贯的令人欢笑的方式演唱了《拉里前夜》。我们两个独特的滑稽角色在喜剧元素爱好者中用大报做了一笔轰动的交易，没有一个内心深处有真正的爱尔兰乐趣而不粗俗的人会吝惜他们辛苦赚来的钱。 男女育儿院的孩子们聚集在窗户上俯瞰着这一场景，他们对这一天的娱乐活动中意外的增加感到高兴，并对贫困小姐妹表示赞扬，因为他们为贫困的孤儿和孤儿提供了绝妙的主意。没有母亲的孩子是一种真正有教育意义的享受。包括许多知名女士在内的总督家庭聚会在总督阁下的陪同下占据了看台上最有利的位置，而被称为“翡翠岛之友”的风景如画的外国代表团则安排在对面的看台上。代表团成员全部出席，成员包括巴奇巴奇·贝尼诺本诺 (Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone) 司令（半身不遂的党元老，必须借助一台强大的蒸汽起重机才能坐到座位上）、皮埃尔保罗·佩蒂特帕坦 (Pierrepaul Petitépatant) 先生、大小丑弗拉丁迈尔·波克坦科特谢夫 (Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff)、大小丑利奥波德 (Leopold) Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler、Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi、Hiram Y. Bomboost、Count Athanatos Karamelopulos、阿里巴巴 Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi、Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria、Hokopoko Harakiri、Hi Hung Chang 、奥拉夫·科伯克德德尔森（Olaf Kobberkeddelsen）、Mynheer Trik van Trumps、Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky、Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch、Borus Hupinkoff、Hurhausdirektor 主席 Hans Chuechli-Steuerli、国家体育馆、博物馆、疗养院和悬吊馆普通私人讲解员普通历史学特别教授 Kriegfried Ueberallgemein。所有代表无一例外地以最强烈的异类措辞表达了他们被要求目睹的无名野蛮行径。 F. O. 之间随后发生了一场激烈的争吵（所有人都参加了）。 T.E.I.关于三月八号还是三月九号是否是爱尔兰守护神出生的正确日期。在争论过程中，人们使用了炮弹、弯刀、回旋镖、火铳、臭罐、切肉机、雨伞、弹射器、指节套、沙袋、生铁块，互相拳打脚踢。年轻的警察麦克法登警官在特使从布特斯敦召来后，迅速恢复了秩序，并闪电般地迅速提出了本月十七日作为对双方都同样光荣的解决方案。这位机智的九尺人的建议立刻引起了所有人的注意，并被一致接受。麦克法登警官受到了所有 F.O.T.E.I. 的衷心祝贺，其中有几个人流了很多血。贝尼诺贝诺内将军被从总统扶手椅下救了出来，他的法律顾问阿夫沃托·帕加米米解释说，他三十二个口袋里藏着的各种物品是他在斗殴期间从下级同事的口袋里取出来的，目的是为了带回这些物品。到他们的感觉。这些物品（其中包括数百件女士和男士的金银手表）很快就归还给了它们的合法主人，总体和谐。

Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o’clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
朗博尔德穿着完美的晨礼服，戴着他最喜欢的花——唐菖蒲，静静地、谦虚地走上断头台。他用一种温和的伦博尔德式咳嗽来宣布他的到来，很多人都试图模仿这种咳嗽声（但没有成功）——简短、费力，但又具有这个人的特征。世界著名刽子手的到来，在巨大的大厅里引起了热烈的欢呼，总督夫人们兴奋地挥舞着她们的手帕，而更加兴奋的外国代表则大声欢呼，呼喊着“hoch”、“banzai”、“eljen”、“zivio”、“ chinchin、polla kronia、hiphip、vive、Allah，其中歌谣之国代表的响亮的evviva（高音双F让人想起太监卡塔拉尼用这些可爱的音符来迷惑我们的曾曾祖母）很容易被辨别出来。正好十七点钟。然后扩音器立即发出了祈祷的信号，瞬间所有的人都裸露了头，自黎恩齐革命以来一直由他的家人拥有的推荐人的父权宽边帽被他在场的医疗顾问皮皮博士摘下。 。这位博学的主教在这位英雄殉道者即将被处以死刑时，以神圣宗教的最后安慰，以最基督教的精神跪在雨水池里，他的法袍高过白发苍苍的头顶，热切地向施恩宝座献上。恳求的祈祷。刽子手的手站在木块旁边，他的脸被隐藏在一个有两个圆形穿孔的十加仑罐子里，他的眼睛从里面发出愤怒的怒火。 当他等待致命的信号时，他通过在粗壮的前臂上磨磨它来测试他可怕的武器的边缘，或者连续快速地斩首一群羊，这些羊是由他的卑鄙但必要的办公室的崇拜者提供的。在他旁边一张漂亮的红木桌子上，整齐地摆放着四分刀、各种经过精心调质的开膛用具（由世界著名的刀具公司 Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield 特别提供）、一个用于容纳十二指肠的赤土平底锅，成功提取出结肠、盲肠和阑尾等，两个宽敞的奶罐注定会接收最珍贵受害者的最珍贵的血液。猫狗联合之家的管家在场，将这些容器运送到该慈善机构。当局贴心地为这场悲剧的中心人物提供了一顿相当美味的饭菜，包括火腿和鸡蛋、煎牛排和洋葱、美味可口的热早餐卷和提神醒脑的茶。他做好了死亡的准备，从头到尾都对整个过程表现出最浓厚的兴趣，但他以我们这个时代罕见的克制态度，高贵地站起来，表达了临终的愿望（立即同意），即应将这顿饭分成等份。加入病人和贫困客房管理员协会的成员，以表达他的尊重和尊重。当这位满脸通红的当选新娘冲破拥挤的旁观者队伍，扑到他即将为她而进入永恒的肌肉发达的怀抱时，情感达到了极致。 英雄将她柔美的身躯拥抱在爱意的怀抱中，深情地低声低语着我自己的希拉。在使用她的基督教名字的鼓励下，她热情地亲吻了他身上所有合适的部位，体面的监狱服装使她的热情能够到达这些部位。当他们混合着咸涩的泪水时，她向他发誓，她将永远珍惜他的记忆，她永远不会忘记她的英雄男孩，他嘴里唱着歌，就好像他只是去参加一场投掷比赛一样。在克朗图克公园。她让他回忆起在安娜·利菲河畔一起度过的幸福童年时光，当时他们沉浸在年轻人天真的消遣之中，忘记了可怕的现在，他们都开怀大笑，所有的观众，包括可敬的人，都开怀大笑。牧师也加入到大家的欢乐之中。那些怪物观众简直欣喜若狂。但很快他们就悲伤不已，最后一次紧握双手。一股新的泪水从他们的泪管中涌出，广大的人群被触动了内心深处，爆发出令人心碎的抽泣，其中最受影响的是年迈的预科生本人。高大的强者、治安官员和爱尔兰皇家警察的和蔼巨人，都在坦率地使用他们的手帕，可以肯定地说，在这个创纪录的集会中，没有人干眼。发生了一件最浪漫的事情，一位英俊的年轻牛津大学毕业生，以对待女性的骑士精神而闻名，他走上前来，出示他的名片、银行存折和家谱，向这位倒霉的年轻女士伸出援手，请求她为这一天命名。 ，并当场接受。 观众中的每一位女士都获得了一份精美的骷髅胸针形状的纪念品，这一及时而慷慨的举动引起了新的情感爆发：当英勇的年轻牛津人（顺便说一句，持有者）阿尔比恩 (Albion) 历史上最受尊敬的名字之一）将一枚昂贵的订婚戒指戴在他满脸通红的未婚妻的手指上，戒指上镶嵌着四叶三叶草形状的祖母绿，兴奋之情无以复加。不仅如此，就连主持这一悲伤时刻的最高元帅、中校汤姆金-马克斯韦尔·弗伦奇穆兰·汤姆林森，他毫不退缩地从炮口中炸掉了相当多的印度兵，现在也无法抑制他自然的情感。 他用邮寄的手套擦去一滴眼泪，被那些碰巧在他身边的特权市民无意中听到，他用结结巴巴的低声自言自语道：

—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.
——上帝啊，如果她不是熟料，那就是流血的馅饼。天哪，这让我有点流血的哭泣，直接，确实如此，当我看到她时，我想起了我的旧土豆泥在莱姆豪斯路上等着我。

So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.
然后公民开始谈论爱尔兰语和公司会议以及所有这些，以及不会说自己语言的少年，乔插手，因为他塞了某人一英镑，布鲁姆用他的两便士投入了他的旧粘液他从乔那里讨来了树桩，谈论盖尔联盟和反待遇联盟，以及酗酒，爱尔兰的诅咒。抗治疗的规模大约如此。天哪，他会让你把各种各样的饮料倒进他的喉咙，直到主召唤他，然后你才能看到他的品脱啤酒的泡沫。有一天晚上，我和一个人一起参加了他们的一个音乐晚会，歌舞升平，她可以在干草捆上站起来，她可以我的莫林·莱，还有一个戴着大肆宣传的蓝丝带徽章的家伙在他身上吹来吹去。爱尔兰人和很多科琳·鲍恩（colleen bawns）拿着禁酒饮料、卖奖牌、橙子、柠檬水和一些老干面包，gob，flahoolagh娱乐，别说话。爱尔兰清醒就是爱尔兰自由。然后，一个老家伙开始吹风笛，所有的盗贼都跟着老牛死去的曲子拖着脚。一两个空中飞行员环顾四周，发现雌性没有发生任何事情，击中腰带以下。

So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him.
然而，正如我所说，那只老狗看到罐子是空的，开始在乔和我身边徘徊。我会善意地训练他，如果他是我的狗，我也会这么做。时不时地踢他一脚，以免他失明。

—Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.
——害怕他会咬你？市民嘲笑道。

—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
——不，我说。但他可能会把我的腿当作路灯柱。

So he calls the old dog over.
于是他把老狗叫了过来。

—What’s on you, Garry? says he.
——你身上有什么，加里？他说。

Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.
然后他开始用爱尔兰语拖拉、殴打他，并与他交谈，旧拖车咆哮着，做出回应，就像歌剧中的二重唱一样。他们之间发出的咆哮声是你从未听到过的。一个无事可做的人应该向报纸无偿公开写一封信，讨论对狗戴口罩之类的命令。他咆哮着，抱怨着，眼睛因干燥而布满了血丝，恐惧症从他的下巴里掉了出来。

All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.
所有对人类文化在低等动物中传播感兴趣的人（它们的名字很多）都应该注意不要错过由著名的古老爱尔兰红塞特狼狗（以前的绰号为“狼狗”）所进行的真正精彩的犬儒表演。加里欧文 (Garryowen)，最近被他的一大群朋友和熟人欧文·加里 (Owen Garry) 重新命名。这次展览是多年善意训练和精心设计的饮食体系的成果，其中包括诗歌朗诵等成就。我们当今最伟大的语音专家（野马不能把它从我们身边拖走！）在他不遗余力地解释和比较所背诵的诗句的过程中，发现它与古代的韵律有着惊人的相似之处（斜体是我们的）。凯尔特吟游诗人。我们并不是在谈论那些以“小甜枝”这个优雅的笔名隐藏自己身份的作家所用的那些令人愉悦的情歌，而是通过这些情歌熟悉了书迷的世界（正如撰稿人 D. O. C. 在当代晚间出版的一篇有趣的通讯中指出的那样） ）在著名的拉夫特里和多纳尔·麦康斯丁的讽刺性流露中发现了更严厉和更个人化的音符，更不用说目前在公众眼中非常流行的更现代的抒情诗人了。我们附上一个由一位著名学者翻译成英文的样本，我们暂时不能随意透露他的名字，尽管我们相信我们的读者会发现这个话题暗示而不是一个暗示。 犬科动物原著的格律系统让人想起威尔士英语错综复杂的头韵和同音节规则，它要复杂得多，但我们相信我们的读者会同意，它的精神已经被很好地抓住了。也许应该补充一点，如果欧文的诗句以一种暗示压抑仇恨的语气稍微缓慢而含糊地说出，效果会大大增加。

The curse of my curses
我的诅咒中的诅咒

After Lowry’s lights.
在洛瑞的灯光之后。

So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.
于是他让特里给狗带点水，天哪，你可以听到他在一英里外舔水的声音。乔问他还能再来一个吗？

—I will, says he, a chara, to show there’s no ill feeling.
——我会的，他，一个角色说，以表明我没有恶意。

Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:
天哪，他可不像卷心菜那样绿。从一家酒吧到另一家酒吧，把它留给你自己的荣誉，带着老吉尔特拉普的狗，厌倦了纳税人和公司。人与兽的娱乐。乔说：

—Could you make a hole in another pint?
——你能在另一品脱啤酒上打个洞吗？

—Could a swim duck? says I.
——鸭子会游泳吗？我说。

—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.
——同样，特里，乔说。您确定不会有任何液体茶点吗？他说。

—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.
——谢谢，不，布鲁姆说。事实上，我只是想见见马丁·坎宁安，你明白吗，关于可怜的迪格纳姆的保险。马丁叫我去他家。你看，他，迪格纳姆，我的意思是，当时没有向公司发出任何转让通知，名义上根据抵押权人无法根据保单收回的法案。

—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?
——《圣战》，乔笑着说，如果老夏洛克登陆了，那就太好了。所以妻子表现得最好，什么？

—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.
——嗯，对于妻子的崇拜者来说，布鲁姆说，这就是要点。

—Whose admirers? says Joe.
——谁的崇拜者？乔说。

—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.
——我是说，妻子的顾问，布鲁姆说。

Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you’re there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
然后他开始困惑地把抵押贷款搞砸了，就像大法官在替补席上为妻子的利益而发放抵押贷款一样，并且建立了信托，但另一方面，迪格纳姆欠布里奇曼钱，如果现在妻子或寡妇对抵押权人的权利提出了异议，直到他几乎根据该法案将我的头与他的抵押人搞混了。他非常安全，他自己没有被指控为流氓和流浪汉，只是他在法庭上有一个朋友。出售集市门票或者你称之为匈牙利皇家特权彩票。真实如你在那里。哦，请将我推荐给以色列人！匈牙利皇室和特权抢劫。

So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You’re a rogue and I’m another.
于是鲍勃·多兰摇摇晃晃地走过来，要求布鲁姆转告迪格纳姆夫人，他对她的麻烦感到抱歉，对葬礼也感到非常抱歉，并告诉她，他说过，所有认识他的人都说过，没有比贫穷更真实、更优秀的人了。小威利死死地告诉她。因该死的愚蠢而窒息。并与布鲁姆握手，以悲剧的方式告诉她这一点。握手吧，兄弟。你是一个流氓，我是另一个。

—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.
——让我，他说，到目前为止，我们的相识，无论以时间的标准来判断，无论多么微不足道，正如我希望并相信的那样，是建立在相互尊重的情感之上的，所以请求你这样做赞成。但是，如果我超越了矜持的限度，就让我的真诚的感情成为我大胆的借口吧。

—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.
——不，另一个人反驳道，我完全理解你的行为动机，我将履行你委托给我的职务，想到这一点，我会感到安慰，虽然这次差事是一件悲伤的事，但你的信任的这种证明在一些人看来是甜蜜的。测量杯子的苦味。

—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.
——那么请允许我握住你的手，他说。我相信，你的善良之心会比我不恰当的言语更好地告诉你最适合表达一种情感的表达方式，如果我要发泄我的情感，这种情感的辛酸甚至会剥夺我的言语。

And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o’clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney’s sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.
和他一起出去，试着笔直地走。五点钟就热闹了。那天晚上，他几乎落后了，只有帕迪·伦纳德认识鲍比，14A。关门后，在新娘街的一家酒吧里，对外面的世界视而不见，用两条围巾和一个看守的恶霸通奸，用茶杯喝波特酒。他称自己是披肩的法国人，约瑟夫·马诺，反对天主教，他年轻时闭着眼睛在亚当和夏娃的教堂里做弥撒，他写了新约，旧约，拥抱和拥抱走私。两条披肩笑得死去活来，扒他的口袋，那个该死的傻瓜和他把搬运工洒了一床，两条披肩互相尖叫着大笑。你的遗嘱怎么样？你有旧约吗？我告诉你，只有帕迪经过那里。然后在周日看到他和他的小妾，她在教堂的过道上摇着尾巴，穿着她的漆皮靴子，同样，她的紫罗兰，像馅饼一样，做着小淑女的样子。杰克·穆尼的妹妹。还有一位母亲的老妓女为街头情侣提供房间。天哪，杰克让他听话了。告诉他如果他不把锅补好，天哪，他就会把他踢出去。

So Terry brought the three pints.
于是特里带来了三品脱啤酒。

—Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.
——在这里，乔说，表示荣幸。在这里，公民。

—Slan leat, says he.
——斯兰利特，他说。

—Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.
——《财富》，乔，我说。祝你健康，公民。

Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.
哎呀，他的嘴已经到了玻璃杯的一半了。想要一笔小钱让他喝酒。

—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.
——阿尔夫，谁是长期竞选市长的人？乔说。

—Friend of yours, says Alf.
——你的朋友，阿尔夫说。

—Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?
——楠楠？乔说。会员？

—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.
——我不会提及任何名字，阿尔夫说。

—I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.
——我也是这么想的，乔说。我现在在与牲畜贸易商议员威廉·菲尔德（William Field）的会议上看到了他。

—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.
——毛茸茸的伊奥帕斯，公民说，那座爆发的火山是所有国家的宠儿，也是他自己的偶像。

So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What’s your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he’d have a soft hand under a hen.
于是，乔开始向市民讲述口蹄疫和牲畜贸易商的情况，并就此事采取行动，市民将他们全部送到右边，布鲁姆带着他的羊药水来治疗痂病，并用软管给咳嗽的小牛喝水，木舌的保证补救措施。因为有一次他在一个屠宰场里。拿着书和铅笔走来走去，这是我的头和我的脚后跟，直到乔·卡夫对他发出了靴子的命令，因为他对一个放牧者说了唇语。诺沃尔先生。教你的祖母如何给鸭子挤奶。皮瑟·伯克在旅馆里告诉我，她的妻子有时会泪流满面，奥多德夫人浑身八英寸厚，哭得眼睛都肿了。无法松开她放屁的绳子，但老鳕鱼的眼睛在她周围旋转，向她展示如何做到这一点。今天你的节目是什么？哎呀。人道的方法。专家表示，因为可怜的动物正在遭受痛苦，而最知名的治疗方法不会给动物带来疼痛，并且可以在疼痛部位轻轻施药。天啊，他在母鸡下面会有一只柔软的手。

Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.
嘎嘎嘎拉。客路客路客路客路。黑莉兹是我们的母鸡。她为我们下蛋。当她生下蛋时，她非常高兴。加拉。客路客路客路客路。然后是好叔叔利奥。他把手放在黑莉兹身下，拿起她的新鲜鸡蛋。嘎嘎嘎嘎嘎啦。客路客路客路客路。

—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.
——无论如何，乔说，菲尔德和南内蒂今晚将前往伦敦，在下议院询问此事。

—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.
——布鲁姆说，你确定议员要去吗？碰巧我想见他。

—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
——嗯，今晚他要乘邮船出发，乔说。

—That’s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn’t phone. No. You’re sure?
——那太糟糕了，布鲁姆说。我特别想要。也许只有菲尔德先生会去。我无法打电话。不，你确定吗？

—Nannan’s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.
——楠楠也要去，乔说。联盟要求他明天就警察局长禁止在公园举行爱尔兰比赛的问题提出问题。公民，您对此有何看法？ Sluagh na h-Eireann。

Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?
Cowe Conacre 先生 (Multifarnham. Nat.)：出于我尊敬的朋友、Shillelagh 议员的问题，我想请问这位尊敬的先生，在没有医学证据的情况下，政府是否已下令屠宰这些动物至于他们的病理状况？

Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.
奥尔福斯先生（塔莫尚特议员）：尊敬的议员们已经掌握了向全院委员会提交的证据。我觉得我无法对此添加任何有用的内容。对于议员的提问，答案是肯定的。

Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?
Orelli O’Reilly 先生（蒙特诺特，国民）：是否曾下达过类似命令，屠杀胆敢在凤凰城公园玩爱尔兰游戏的人类动物？

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.
Allfours 先生：答案是否定的。

Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)
考·康纳克先生：这位尊敬的先生著名的米切尔斯敦电报是否启发了财政部长的政策？ （噢！噢！）

Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.
Allfours 先生：我必须注意到这个问题。

Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.
Staylewit 先生（印第安纳州邦科姆）：不要犹豫，开枪吧。

(Ironical opposition cheers.)
（讽刺的反对者欢呼。）

The speaker: Order! Order!
发言者：命令！命令！

(The house rises. Cheers.)
（房子升起。干杯。）

—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?
——乔说，就是这个人让盖尔体育复兴了。他就坐在那里。那个逃走了詹姆斯·斯蒂芬斯的人。全爱尔兰 16 磅铅球冠军。公民，你最好的投掷是什么？

—Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.
——Na bacleis，这位公民说道，表现得很谦虚。曾经有一段时间我无论如何都和其他人一样好。

—Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.
——把它放在那里，公民，乔说。你真是好多了。

—Is that really a fact? says Alf.
——这真的是事实吗？阿尔夫说。

—Yes, says Bloom. That’s well known. Did you not know that?
——是的，布鲁姆说。这是众所周知的。你不知道吗？

So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That’s a straw. Declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.
因此，他们开始谈论爱尔兰体育和青少年运动，例如草地网球和赫尔利，以及重新建立一个国家的石头和活力，以及所有这些。当然，对于划船运动员的心脏剧烈运动是否不好，布鲁姆也必须发表自己的看法。如果你从血淋淋的地板上拿起一根吸管，并且对布鲁姆说：看，布鲁姆，我就向我的反望卡萨尔宣告。你看到那根稻草了吗？那是一根稻草。向我姑姑宣布他会谈论这个问题一个小时，这样他就会平稳地谈论这件事。

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O’ciarnain’s in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.
在 Sluagh na h-Eireann 的主持下，在 Sraid na Bretaine Bheag 的 Brian O'ciarnain 的古老大厅里进行了一场最有趣的讨论，讨论了古代盖尔运动的复兴以及古希腊所理解的体育文化的重要性以及古罗马和古爱尔兰，为种族的发展。会议由德高望重的贵族会主席主持，出席人数众多。在主席的富有启发性的演讲和雄辩有力的精彩演讲之后，接下来就我们古代潘塞尔特人祖先的古代竞技和运动复兴的愿望进行了关于通常的高标准的最有趣和富有启发性的讨论。我们古语事业中著名且备受尊敬的工作者约瑟夫·麦卡锡·海因斯先生雄辩地呼吁复兴古老的盖尔运动和消遣活动，芬恩·麦克库尔早晚都在练习这些运动和消遣活动，旨在复兴最好的文化。自古以来我们就继承了男子气概和英勇的传统。 L. Bloom 得到了热烈的掌声和嘘声，他支持了歌手主席的否定，并通过一个非常值得注意的渲染结束了讨论，以回应来自保险杠各部分的反复要求和热烈的掌声。不朽的托马斯·奥斯本·戴维斯（Thomas Osborne Davis）的常青诗句（幸好太熟悉了，不需要在这里回忆）一个国家再次在执行过程中，这位经验丰富的爱国冠军可以说，不用担心矛盾，已经相当出色了。 爱尔兰人卡鲁索-加里波第的表演最为出色，他那洪亮的音符在这首只有我们公民才能唱的历史悠久的国歌中得到了最大的优势。他精湛的高级声乐以其卓越的品质极大地提高了他已经国际化的声誉，受到大批观众的热烈鼓掌，其中值得注意的是许多神职人员的杰出成员以及新闻界、律师界和其他学术界的代表。诉讼程序随后终止。

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?
——谈到剧烈运动，阿尔夫说，你参加了基奥与贝内特的比赛吗？

—No, says Joe.
——不，乔说。

—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
——我听说某某人因此赚了一百英镑，阿尔夫说。

—Who? Blazes? says Joe.
-WHO？火焰？乔说。

And says Bloom:
布鲁姆说：

—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.
——例如，我所说的网球是敏捷性和训练眼睛。

—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.
——嗯，布雷泽斯，阿尔夫说。他透露说迈勒正在喝啤酒来提高赔率，而且他一直在殴打。

—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor’s son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.
——我们认识他，公民说。叛徒的儿子。我们知道是什么让英国的黄金进入了他的口袋。

—-True for you, says Joe.
——对你来说确实如此，乔说。

And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:
布鲁姆再次插话关于草地网球和血液循环，问阿尔夫：

—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?
——伯根，你不这么认为吗？

—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.
——迈勒用他擦地板上的灰尘，阿尔夫说。希南和塞耶斯对此来说简直是个该死的傻瓜。递给他爸爸妈妈一顿毒打。看小鱼没到肚脐眼，大家伙在猛划。天哪，他在风中给了他最后一个冰球，昆斯伯里规则等等，让他吐出了他从未吃过的东西。

It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.
当迈勒和珀西计划为五十英镑的钱包戴上手套时，这是一场历史性的激烈战斗。尽管他因体重不足而受到限制，但都柏林的宠物羔羊通过高超的环术技术弥补了这一缺陷。最后一场烟花表演对两位冠军来说都是一场艰苦的比赛。次中量级军士长在之前的混战中喝了一些活泼的红葡萄酒，在此期间基奥担任左右将军，炮兵在宠物的鼻子上做了一些巧妙的工作，而迈勒看上去昏昏沉沉的。这名士兵言归正传，首先一记有力的左刺拳，这位爱尔兰角斗士以一记僵硬的刺拳击中贝内特的下巴进行报复。红衣人闪身躲开，但都柏林人用左勾拳将他举起，身体一拳打得很漂亮。男人们来了。迈勒很快就开始忙碌起来，把他的对手压倒在地，比赛以那个体型更大的人被绑在绳子上而结束，迈勒惩罚了他。英国人的右眼几乎是闭着的，他在自己的角落里被大量的水淋湿了，当铃声响起时，他充满了斗志和勇气，有信心在吉格泰姆中击倒埃布兰尼特的拳头。这是一场坚持到底的战斗，也是这场比赛的最佳人选。两人打得如虎添翼，气氛异常激动。裁判两次警告帕金·珀西不要抱住，但这只宠物很狡猾，他的步法很值得一看。在一番寒暄之后，这名军人巧妙地上一刀，让对手嘴里的血流出来，羔羊突然冲进了对手的全身，一记左拳狠狠地击中了贝内特的腹部，把他摔倒在地。这是一场干净而聪明的淘汰赛。 在紧张的期待中，当贝内特的第二个奥勒·普福茨·韦特斯坦（Ole Pfotts Wettstein）认输时，这位波托贝洛拳手被算出局了，这位桑特里男孩在公众的疯狂欢呼声中被宣布为胜利者，他们冲破了绳索，高兴地围观了他。

—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north.
——阿尔夫说，他知道他的面包哪一面涂了黄油。我听说他现在正在北方进行巡回演唱会。

—He is, says Joe. Isn’t he?
——他是的，乔说。他不是吗？

—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That’s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.
-WHO？布鲁姆说。是啊。确实如此。是的，你看，这是一种夏季旅行。只是一个假期。

—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe.
—B 女士是最耀眼的明星，不是吗？乔说。

—My wife? says Bloom. She’s singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.
-我的妻子？布鲁姆说。她在唱歌，是的。我认为这也会成功。

He’s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.
他是一个出色的组织者。出色的。

Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That’s the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip. ‘Twixt me and you Caddareesh.
Hoho Begob 对自己说“我”说“我”。这解释了椰子中含有牛奶以及动物胸部没有毛发的原因。火焰在长笛上吹奏着。巡回演唱会。肮脏的丹是岛桥附近狡猾的人的儿子，他两次将同样的马卖给政府来对抗布尔人。老什么什么。博伊兰先生，我打电话询问了贫困和水费问题。你什么？水费，博伊兰先生。你什么什么？这是能组织她的家伙，听我的建议。 ‘把我和你卡达雷什交织在一起。

Pride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
卡尔佩岩石山的骄傲，特威迪的黑发女儿。她长得绝世美貌，空气中弥漫着枇杷和杏仁的香气。阿拉米达的花园知道她的脚步：橄榄园知道她的脚步并鞠躬。利奥波德的贞洁配偶是她：丰满胸怀的玛丽昂。

And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.
瞧，奥莫洛伊家族的一位成员进来了，他是一位英俊的英雄，脸色白皙，但有些红润，国王陛下的律师学过法律，和他一起的是兰伯特贵族血统的王子和继承人。

—Hello, Ned.
——你好，内德。

—Hello, Alf.
——你好，阿尔夫。

—Hello, Jack.
——你好，杰克。

—Hello, Joe.
——你好，乔。

—God save you, says the citizen.
——上帝保佑你，公民说。

—Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned?
——请救救你吧，J.J. 说。那会是什么，内德？

—Half one, says Ned.
——半个，内德说。

So J. J. ordered the drinks.
于是 J.J. 点了饮料。

—Were you round at the court? says Joe.
——你在法庭附近吗？乔说。

—Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he.
——是的，J.J. 说。他会解决这个问题，内德，他说。

—Hope so, says Ned.
——希望如此，奈德说。

Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs’s. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What’s your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he’ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I’m thinking.
现在那两个人在做什么？ J.J.把他从大陪审团名单上除名，另一个则给了他一条腿。他的名字就在斯塔布斯的名下。打牌，与眼睛里戴着时髦眼镜的时髦人士交往，喝汽水，他在令状和扣押令中几乎窒息。在弗朗西斯街的康明斯当了他的金表，当我和皮瑟一起从流行中释放他的靴子时，在私人办公室里没有人会认识他。先生，您叫什么名字？邓恩，他说。哎呀，我说完了。天啊，总有一天他会哭着回家，我想。

—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.
——你看到那儿那个该死的疯子布林了吗？阿尔夫说。 U.p：向上。

—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.
——是的，J.J. 说，正在寻找私家侦探。

—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.
——嗯，内德说。他想要在法庭上发表讲话，但科尼·凯莱赫(Corny Kelleher)绕过他，告诉他先检查笔迹。

—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I’d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.
——一万英镑，阿尔夫笑着说道。天啊，为了在法官和陪审团面前听到他的演讲，我愿意付出一切。

—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
——是你干的吗，阿尔夫？乔说。真相，全部真相，只有真相，所以帮助你吉米·约翰逊。

—Me? says Alf. Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.
-我？阿尔夫说。别把你的金莲花浇在我的性格上。

—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.
——乔说，无论你发表什么声明，都会被记下来作为对你不利的证据。

—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.
——当然，行动会撒谎，J.J. 说。这意味着他不够冷静。 U.p：向上。

—Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he’s balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.
——构图你的眼睛！阿尔夫笑着说道。你知道他很温和吗？看看他的头。你知道吗，有些早上他必须用鞋拔子戴上帽子。

—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
——是的，J.J. 说，但从法律的角度来看，诽谤的真相并不能成为对发表诽谤罪的起诉的辩护。

—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.
——哈哈，阿尔夫，乔说。

—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
——不过，布鲁姆说，考虑到那个可怜的女人，我指的是他的妻子。

—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.
——可怜她，公民说。或者任何其他女人都嫁给了一半。

—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he …
——多少一半？布鲁姆说。你的意思是他……

—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that’s neither fish nor flesh.
——我是说一半一半，公民说。一个非鱼非肉的家伙。

—Nor good red herring, says Joe.
——这也不是转移注意力的好办法，乔说。

—That what’s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.
——这就是我的意思，公民说。一个 pishogue，如果你知道那是什么的话。

Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.
贝戈布 我看到麻烦来了。布卢姆解释说，他的意思是因为妻子不得不到处追随那个口吃的老傻瓜，这太残忍了。残忍地对待动物，所以让那个该死的贫困的布林在草地上，他的胡子绊倒了他，带来了雨水。嫁给他后，她的鼻子也变得很臭，因为他老朋友的一个表弟对教皇很开放。墙上挂着他的照片，留着斯马歇尔·斯威尼的小胡子，来自夏山的布里尼先生，埃塔利亚诺，教宗的教皇佐瓦夫，已经离开码头，前往莫斯街。告诉我们他是谁？一个无名小卒，两双背心和通道，每周七先令，他身上戴着各种各样的胸甲，向世界发出蔑视。

—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.
——而且，J.J. 说，明信片就是出版物。在萨德格罗夫诉霍尔案中，这被认为是恶意的充分证据。在我看来，行动可能会撒谎。

Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.
请给我六先令八便士。谁想要你的意见？让我们安静地喝我们的品脱吧。天啊，我们自己连那么多事都不会被允许。

—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
——嗯，祝你身体健康，杰克，内德说。

—Good health, Ned, says J. J.
——祝你身体健康，内德，J. J.

—-There he is again, says Joe.
——他又来了，乔说。

—Where? says Alf.
-在哪里？阿尔夫说。

And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.
结果他腋下夹着书经过门口，妻子在他身边，科尼·凯莱赫用他的墙眼在他们经过时往里看，像父亲一样跟他说话，试图卖给他一口二手棺材。

—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
——加拿大的诈骗案是如何进行的？乔说。

—Remanded, says J. J.
——还押，J. J.

One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
其中一个名叫詹姆斯·沃特（James Wought）、萨菲罗（Saphiro）、斯巴克（Spark）和斯皮罗（Spiro）的宽吻兄弟会在报纸上登了一则广告，称他愿意花二十鲍勃提供前往加拿大的机票。什么？你看到我的眼白里有绿色吗？当然是一个该死的巴尼。什么？骗走了他们所有人，来自米斯郡的小伙子和巴德哈克斯，是的，还有他自己的肾。 J.J. 告诉我们，有一个古老的希伯来人扎雷茨基（Zaretsky）或者什么东西在证人席上哭泣，他戴着帽子，向神圣的摩西发誓，他被困在两英镑。

—Who tried the case? says Joe.
——谁审理了这个案子？乔说。

—Recorder, says Ned.
——录音机，内德说。

—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
——可怜的弗雷德里克老先生，阿尔夫说，你可以把他的两只眼睛都蒙住。

—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench.
——内德说，心像狮子一样大。告诉他一个关于拖欠房租、生病的妻子和一群孩子的悲惨故事，相信他会在板凳上泪流满面。

—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.
——嗯，阿尔夫说。鲁本·J 真是太幸运了，那天他没有因为巴特桥附近的公司起诉可怜的小古姆利而把他送上被告席，那是个介石。

And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
他开始摘下旧录音机，哭了起来：

—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?
——一件最可耻的事！这个勤劳的可怜人！有多少儿童？十，你说是吗？

—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
——是的，您的崇拜。我的妻子患有伤寒。

—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.
——还有患伤寒的妻子！可耻！立即离开法庭，先生。不，先生，我不会下订单付款。先生，你竟然敢到我面前来让我下订单！一个勤劳勤劳的可怜人！我驳回此案。

And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.
然而，在牛眼女神月的十六日，以及天空之女神圣不可分割的三位一体节日之后的第三周，当时处女月亮正处于她的上弦月，事情是这样的：博学的法官将它们送上了法庭。考特尼大师坐在自己的房间里，进行了重述，而大师安德鲁斯法官在没有陪审团的情况下坐在遗嘱认证法庭上，仔细权衡并思考了第一负责人在遗嘱和最终遗嘱问题上对财产的主张。已故的葡萄酒商雅各布·哈利迪 (Jacob Halliday) 的不动产和个人财产的处置，与婴儿、心智不健全的利文斯通 (Livingstone) 和另一个人的关系。驯鹰人弗雷德里克爵士来到了格林街庄严的宫廷。大约五点钟的时候，他坐在那里，在都柏林市县的所有地区和部分的委员会上执行布雷恩法。与他坐在一起的是伊尔十二个部落的最高辛赫德里姆，每个部落都有一个人，帕特里克部落、休部落、欧文部落、康恩部落和奥斯卡部落弗格斯部落、芬恩部落、德莫特部落、科马克部落、凯文部落、考尔特部落、奥西安部落，总共有十二个好人和真实的。他借着死在十字架上的主召唤他们，让他们在他们的至高无上的主国王和法庭上的囚犯之间的问题上做出真正的解脱，并根据证据做出真正的判决，所以帮助他们上帝和亲吻这本书。 他们在座位上站了起来，那十二位伊阿尔人，他们以自古以来的上帝之名起誓，他们将行他的正义之事。执法人员立即从他们的主楼中带出一名正义侦探犬根据收到的信息逮捕了他。他们铐住了他的手脚，不保释就将他带走，但更愿意对他提出指控，因为他是一个罪犯。

—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.
——那些来到爱尔兰的公民说，这些都是好事，让这个国家充满了虫子。

So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.
所以布卢姆假装他什么也没听到，然后他开始和乔说话，告诉他在第一次之前不必为那件小事烦恼，但如果他愿意对克劳福德先生说一句话的话。因此，乔发誓，他会做所有的事情。

—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That’s the whole secret.
——因为，你看，布鲁姆说，对于广告来说，你必须有重复。这就是全部秘密。

—Rely on me, says Joe.
——相信我，乔说。

—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.
——爱尔兰公民和穷人说，这是在欺骗农民。我们不想再有陌生人进入我们的房子。

—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It’s just that Keyes, you see.
——哦，我相信不会有问题的，海因斯，布鲁姆说。你看，这就是凯斯。

—Consider that done, says Joe.
——就这样吧，乔说。

—Very kind of you, says Bloom.
——你真好，布卢姆说。

—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.
——陌生人，公民说。我们自己的错。我们让他们进来。我们把他们带进来。奸妇和她的情人把撒克逊强盗带到了这里。

—Decree nisi, says J. J.
——J. J. 下令

And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.
布卢姆表现出对任何事情都非常感兴趣，桶后面的角落里有一张蜘蛛网，公民在他身后皱着眉头，而他脚下的老狗则抬起头来知道该咬谁以及何时咬。

—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes.
——一位不名誉的妻子，公民说，这就是我们所有不幸的原因。

—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
——阿尔夫说，她就在这里，在《警察公报》上咯咯地笑着，特里则站在柜台上，身上涂满了战衣。

—Give us a squint at her, says I.
——让我们斜视她一下，我说。

And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.
这只是特里借用科尼·凯莱赫的一张肮脏的洋基照片。增大私处的秘密。社会美女的不当行为。富有的芝加哥承包商诺曼·W·塔珀 (Norman W. Tupper) 在泰勒警官的腿上找到了漂亮但不忠的妻子。穿着灯笼裤的贝尔行为不端，她的情人在抚摸她的痒痒，诺曼·W·塔珀拿着豌豆射手跳了进来，正好在她和泰勒警官完成了循环戏法后迟到了。

—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
——噢，杰克斯，珍妮，乔说，你的衬衫多短啊！

—There’s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?
——有头发，乔，我说。从那一根上取下一根奇怪的老咸牛肉尾巴，什么？

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.
不管怎样，约翰·怀斯·诺兰和莱内汉和他一起进来了，脸上的表情就像一顿迟到的早餐一样长。

—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?
——好吧，这位公民说，行动现场的最新情况是什么？市政厅的那些修补匠在党团会议上对爱尔兰语做出了什么决定？

O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.
奥诺兰身穿闪亮的盔甲，低着头向艾琳的强大、崇高而强大的酋长致敬，并让他知道所发生的事情，如何让最顺从的城市的严肃长老，王国的第二个，在索尔塞尔遇见了他们，在那里，在向居住在天堂的诸神进行了适当的祈祷之后，他们进行了庄严的商议，如果可能的话，他们可能会再次在凡人中使带翅膀的语言受到尊重。分裂的盖尔人。

—It’s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.
——公民说，它正在游行。让那些该死的野蛮萨森纳赫人和他们的方言见鬼去吧。

So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.
所以 J.J. 插了一句话，在你听到另一个故事之前，对一个故事做一些大事是好的，然后眨眼的事实和纳尔逊的政策，对望远镜视而不见，起草一份剥夺公民权利的法案来弹劾一个国家，而布鲁姆试图支持他的温和和忧虑以及他们的殖民地和文明。

—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.
——你是说，他们的梅毒，公民说。让他们见鬼去吧！一个无用之神的诅咒从侧面射到了该死的粗鲁妓女身上！没有音乐，没有艺术，也没有名副其实的文学。他们从我们这里偷走了任何文明。私生子鬼魂的舌头之子。

—The European family, says J. J. …
——欧洲家庭，J. J. 说……

—They’re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d’aisance.
——公民说，他们不是欧洲人。我和巴黎的凯文·伊根一起在欧洲。除了内阁外，在欧洲的任何地方你都看不到他们或他们的语言的踪迹。

And says John Wyse:
约翰·怀斯说道：

—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
——许多花朵生来就是为了不被人看见而脸红的。

And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
懂得一点行话的 Lenehan 说道：

—Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!
——Conspuez les Anglais！佩菲德·阿尔比恩！

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.
他说着，然后用粗鲁、粗壮、有力的双手举起了浓浓的泡沫麦芽酒，嘴里念叨着他的部落口号“Lamh Dearg Abu”，他一饮而尽，毁灭了他的敌人，这是一个由强大英勇的英雄组成的种族，海浪的统治者。 ，他们坐在雪花石膏的王座上，像不死的众神一样沉默。

—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.
——你怎么了，我对莱内汉说。你看起来就像一个失去了鲍勃并找到了制革商的人。

—Gold cup, says he.
——金杯，他说。

—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
——谁赢了，莱纳汉先生？特里说。

—Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.
——一次性的，他说，比例是二十比一。一个等级外人。其余的无处可去。

—And Bass’s mare? says Terry.
——巴斯的母马呢？特里说。

—Still running, says he. We’re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.
——还在跑，他说。我们都在购物车里。博伊兰为他自己和一位女性朋友在我的权杖小费上投入了两英镑。

—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden’s.
——特里说，我自己也有半克朗，是弗林先生送给我的仙粉黛。霍华德·瓦尔登勋爵的。

—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.
——二十比一，莱内汉说。这就是户外厕所的生活。扔掉，他说。拿起饼干，谈论拇囊炎。脆弱，你的名字是权杖。

So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
于是他走到鲍勃·多兰留下的饼干罐边，看看是否有什么东西他可以点头举起，老杂种狗在他身后用他肮脏的鼻子支撑着他的运气。老母亲哈伯德走到橱柜前。

—Not there, my child, says he.
——不在那里，我的孩子，他说。

—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She’d have won the money only for the other dog.
——保持你的鸡鸡向上，乔说。她只会为另一只狗赢得钱。

And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.
J.J. 和公民就法律和历史进行争论，而布鲁姆却坚持说了一个奇怪的词。

—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own.
——布鲁姆说，有些人可以看到别人眼中的微粒，但看不到自己眼中的梁木。

—Raimeis, says the citizen. There’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?
——雷梅斯，公民说。如果你知道这意味着什么的话，没有人比看不见的人更盲目。今天我们失踪的两千万爱尔兰人在哪里，而不是我们失落的四个部落？我们的陶器和纺织品是全世界最好的！还有我们在尤维纳尔时期在罗马出售的羊毛，我们的亚麻和来自安特里姆织布机的锦缎，还有我们利默里克的蕾丝，我们的制革厂和巴利伯的白色燧石玻璃，以及我们自提花以来一直拥有的胡格诺派府绸。里昂和我们的丝织品、福克斯福德花呢和来自新罗斯加尔默罗修道院的象牙绒，全世界都没有类似的。穿过大力神柱的希腊商人在哪里？直布罗陀现在被人类的敌人夺走了，他们带着黄金和泰尔紫在韦克斯福德的卡门集市上出售？阅读塔西佗和托勒密，甚至吉拉尔杜斯·坎布伦西斯。葡萄酒、毛皮、康尼马拉大理石、来自蒂珀雷里的银器，首屈一指，我们至今仍享有盛名的马匹，爱尔兰的爱好，西班牙国王菲利普愿意支付关税以换取在我们水域捕鱼的权利。安格利亚的黄色约翰因我们的贸易和壁炉被毁而欠我们什么？巴罗河和香农河的河床不会加深数百万英亩的沼泽和沼泽，让我们都死于肺结核吗？

—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown’s …
——约翰·怀斯说，如果不采取措施重新造林，我们很快就会像葡萄牙一样没有树木，或者像黑尔戈兰岛一样只有一棵树。落叶松，冷杉，所有针叶树科的树木都长得很快。我正在读卡斯尔敦勋爵的报告……

—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.
——公民说，拯救它们吧，戈尔韦的巨型白蜡树和基尔代尔树干长达四十英尺、树叶面积一英亩的酋长榆树。在俄亥俄州爱尔兰美丽的山丘上，为未来的爱尔兰人拯救爱尔兰的树木。

—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
——欧洲正在关注你，莱内汉说。

The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
国际时尚界今天下午出席了爱尔兰国家林务员高级首席护林员 Jean Wyse de Neaulan 骑士与 Pine Valley 的 Fir Conifer 小姐的婚礼。西尔维斯特·埃尔姆谢德夫人、芭芭拉·洛夫伯奇夫人、波尔·阿什夫人、霍莉·黑兹莱斯夫人、达芙妮·贝斯小姐、多萝西·坎布雷克小姐、克莱德·十二树夫人、罗温·格林夫人、海伦·维内加丁夫人、弗吉尼亚·克里珀小姐、格拉迪斯·比奇小姐、奥利弗·加斯小姐、布兰奇小姐梅普尔、莫德·桃花木夫人、迈拉·默特尔小姐、普里西拉·接骨木花小姐、蜜蜂·金银花小姐、格蕾丝·白杨小姐、O·含羞草·桑小姐、雷切尔·雪松小姐、莉莉安和维奥拉·丁拉克小姐、胆怯·阿斯彭纳尔小姐、基蒂·杜威-莫斯夫人、梅小姐Hawthorne、Gloriana Palme 夫人、Liana Forrest 夫人、Arabella Blackwood 夫人和 Oakholme Regis 的 Norma Holyoake 夫人出席了仪式，为仪式增光添彩。被她的父亲，腺体的麦康尼弗送走的新娘，在一件用绿色丝光丝绸制成的作品中看起来非常迷人，在微光灰色的下衬上塑形，用宽祖母绿的轭系着，最后用深色流苏的三层荷叶边，橡子青铜色的布纹和臀部插入物缓解了这一方案。伴娘，新娘的姐妹拉奇·康尼弗小姐和云杉·康尼弗小姐，穿着同样色调的非常合身的服装，精致的羽毛玫瑰图案被加工成细条纹的褶皱，并在翡翠无边无边帽上反复出现。苍鹭羽毛的淡色珊瑚的形式。恩里克·弗洛尔先生以其众所周知的能力主持了管风琴，除了规定数量的婚礼弥撒外，还在仪式结束时演奏了一首新颖而引人注目的曲目《樵夫，饶恕那棵树》。 在得到教皇的祝福后，离开霍尔托的圣菲亚克教堂时，这对幸福的夫妇受到了榛子、山毛榉、月桂叶、柳絮、常春藤、冬青莓、槲寄生小枝和速生芽的有趣交火。 Wyse Conifer Neaulan 夫妇将在黑森林度过一个安静的蜜月。

—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
——这位公民说，我们的目光投向欧洲。在这些杂种狗生出来之前，我们就与西班牙、法国、弗莱明人进行了贸易，戈尔韦的西班牙麦芽酒，酒黑水道上的酒树皮。

—And will again, says Joe.
——而且还会再来，乔说。

—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh. our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.
——在圣母的帮助下，我们会再次做到这一点，”公民拍着大腿说道。我们空荡荡的港口将再次满员，皇后镇、金塞尔、戈尔韦、布莱克索德湾、凯里王国的文特里、基利贝格斯，世界第三大港口，拥有戈尔韦林奇斯和卡文奥的桅杆船队当戴斯蒙德伯爵可以与查理五世皇帝本人签订条约时，赖利斯和都柏林的奥肯尼迪家族。他说，当人们看到第一艘爱尔兰战列舰迎风而行，我们自己的旗帜出现在前面时，你的亨利·都铎的竖琴都没有，不，最古老的旗帜漂浮着，德斯蒙德和托蒙德省的旗帜，三蓝色田野上的王冠，是米利修斯的三个儿子。

And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.
他喝掉了最后一品脱啤酒。莫亚。浑身都是风和尿，就像一只鞣革猫。康诺特的牛有长角。尽管他的血腥生活值得被记录下来，并向聚集在沙纳戈尔登的群众发表他的长篇大论，但他不敢向莫莉·马奎尔家族露面，他们正在寻找他，让他因为抢占了一个被驱逐的房客的土地而被曝光。 。

—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?
——听听，听听，约翰·怀斯说。你会得到什么？

—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
——莱内汉说，皇家自耕农来庆祝这一时刻。

—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?
——半个，特里，约翰·怀斯说，然后举起了手。特里！你睡着了吗？

—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
——是的，先生，特里说。小杯威士忌和一瓶奥尔索普。是的，先生。

Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.
阿尔夫悬在该死的报纸上寻找辛辣的东西，而不是关注公众。画面中，一场激烈的比赛，试图打破他们血淋淋的头骨，一个人低着头攻击另一个人，就像门口的一头公牛一样。还有另一件事：佐治亚州奥马哈的《黑兽焚烧》。许多戴着宽边软帽的戴德伍德迪克斯，他们向挂在树上的桑博开枪，桑博的舌头伸出来，他身下有篝火。天哪，他们应该把他淹死在海里，然后电死他，把他钉在十字架上，以确保他们的工作。

—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?
——但是内德说，那能够让我们的敌人陷入困境的战斗海军呢？

—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.
——我会告诉你那是怎么回事，公民说。这真是人间地狱。阅读报纸上有关朴茨茅斯训练船上鞭刑的报道。一位自称“令人厌恶的人”的人写道。

So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.
于是他开始向我们讲述体罚的事，以及戴着三角帽的焦油船员、军官和海军少将的故事，还有拿着新教圣经见证惩罚的牧师，还有一个年轻的小伙子被带出来，哭喊着要他妈妈，他们把他绑了起来在枪托上。

—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.
——这位公民说，老流氓约翰·贝雷斯福德爵士称之为“臀部一打”，但现代上帝的英国人称之为“鞭打臀部”。

And says John Wyse:
约翰·怀斯说道：

—‘Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
——这种习俗在违反时比在遵守时更受尊重。

Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.
然后他告诉我们，武装长官带着一根长手杖来了，他抽出手杖，用鞭子抽打这个可怜小伙子血淋淋的后背，直到他大喊“梅拉谋杀”。

—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.
——那是你们光荣的英国海军，公民说，统治着地球。

The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.
这些家伙永远不会成为奴隶，拥有上帝地球上唯一的世袭房间，他们的土地掌握在十几个野猪和棉球男爵手中。这就是他们所吹嘘的由苦役和鞭打农奴组成的伟大帝国。

—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
——太阳永远不会升起，乔说。

—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.
——而悲剧的是，公民说，他们相信这一点。不幸的雅虎相信这一点。

They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.
他们相信罗德，全能的鞭笞者，人间地狱的创造者，也相信杰基·塔尔，枪之子，因邪恶的夸耀而孕育，出生于战斗海军，遭受过臀部和打打的折磨，被撕裂，被剥皮，被剥皮。咖喱，像该死的地狱一样大喊大叫，第三天他再次从床上爬起来，驶入避难所，坐在他的横梁上，等待进一步的命令，从那里他将来做苦工谋生并获得报酬。

—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force?
——但是，布鲁姆说，纪律并非在任何地方都一样。我的意思是，如果你以武力对抗武力，这里不也是一样吗？

Didn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.
我没告诉过你吗？就像我正在喝这杯黑啤酒一样，如果他在最后一口气，他会试图让你相信死亡也是活着。

—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
——我们将以武力对抗武力，该公民说。我们在海的另一边有我们的大爱尔兰。他们被赶出家门，被赶出家门，在黑色的47。他们的泥舱和路边的盾牌被攻城锤压低了，《泰晤士报》搓着手告诉白人撒克逊人，爱尔兰的爱尔兰人很快就会像爱尔兰的红皮人一样少。美国。就连大土耳其人也给我们送来了他的皮亚斯特。但萨塞纳赫人试图在国内让国家挨饿，而土地上却长满了英国鬣狗在里约热内卢买卖的农作物。哎，他们把成群结队的农民赶走了。其中两万人死在棺材里。但那些来到自由之地的人却记得那片奴役之地。他们将再次复仇，毫无胆怯，格拉努阿莱的儿子们，凯瑟琳·尼·胡利汉的冠军。

—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was …
——完全正确，布鲁姆说。但我的观点是……

—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.
——我们已经等那一天很久了，公民，内德说。因为可怜的老妇人告诉我们法国人在海上并在基拉拉登陆。

—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?
——是的，约翰·怀斯说。我们为斯图亚特王室而战，他们背叛了我们，反对威廉派，他们背叛了我们。记住利默里克和破碎的条约石。我们把最好的血液献给了法国和西班牙大雁。丰特努瓦，是吗？还有西班牙得土安公爵萨斯菲尔德和奥唐纳，以及玛丽亚·特蕾莎的陆军元帅加缪的尤利西斯·布朗。但我们为此得到了什么？

—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.
-法国人！这位公民说。舞蹈大师集！你知道这是什么吗？对于爱尔兰来说，它们根本不值一个烤屁。他们现在不是想在泰佩的晚宴上与背信弃义的阿尔比恩达成友好协约吗？欧洲的煽动者，他们一直都是。

—Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
——Conspuez les Français，莱内汉一边喝着啤酒一边说道。

—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?
——至于普罗什派和汉诺威派，乔说，我们还没有受够那些王位上的那些吃香肠的混蛋吗？从选帝侯乔治到德国小伙子和那个死了的气胀的老母狗？

Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.
天哪，我不得不嘲笑他对那个戴着眼罩的老家伙的说法，她每天晚上都在她的皇宫里喝得烂醉，老维克，带着她的满山露水和她的车夫把她拉起来身体和骨头滚到床上，她拉着他的胡须，给他唱一些关于莱茵河上埃伦的老歌，然后到酒更便宜的地方去。

—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
——好吧，J.J. 说。我们现在有和平缔造者爱德华了。

—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There’s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!
——把这句话告诉一个傻瓜，公民说。那个男孩身上看起来更像是痘而不是和平。爱德华·圭尔夫-韦廷！

—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.
——乔说，对于那些神圣的男孩、爱尔兰的牧师和主教，他们用撒旦陛下的赛马颜色装饰他在梅努斯的房间，并贴上他骑师所骑的所有马匹的照片，你对此有何看法。都柏林伯爵，同样如此。

—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.
——他们应该把他自己骑过的所有女人都贴上来，小阿尔夫说。

And says J. J.:
J.J. 说：

—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.
——对空间的考虑影响了领主们的决定。

—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
——公民，你愿意再尝试一下吗？乔说。

—Yes, sir, says he. I will.
——是的，先生，他说。我会。

—You? says Joe.
-你？乔说。

—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
——感谢你，乔，我说。愿你的影子永远不会减少。

—Repeat that dose, says Joe.
——重复该剂量，乔说。

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.
布卢姆正在和约翰·怀斯聊个不停，他对他戴着的厚厚的泥色杯子和他那双老羽毛眼珠转动起来感到非常兴奋。

—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.
——迫害，他说，世界历史上都充满了迫害。民族仇恨在民族之间延续。

—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
——但是你知道国家意味着什么吗？约翰怀斯说。

—Yes, says Bloom.
——是的，布鲁姆说。

—What is it? says John Wyse.
-它是什么？约翰怀斯说。

—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.
-一个国家？布鲁姆说。民族是生活在同一个地方的同一个人。

—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m living in the same place for the past five years.
——那么，内德笑着说，如果真是这样的话，我就是一个国家了，因为过去五年我都住在同一个地方。

So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:
当然，每个人都嘲笑布鲁姆，并说他试图摆脱困境：

—Or also living in different places.
——或者也住在不同的地方。

—That covers my case, says Joe.
——这就是我的情况，乔说。

—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.
—如果我可以问的话，你是哪个国家的？这位公民说。

—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.
——爱尔兰，布鲁姆说。我出生在这里。爱尔兰。

The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.
这名市民什么也没说，只是清理了喉咙里的口水，然后，天哪，他在角落里把一只红岸牡蛎吐了出来。

—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.
——在你推开之后，乔，他一边说，一边拿出手帕擦干自己。

—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.
——给你，公民，乔说。把它拿在右手上，跟着我重复下面的话。

The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S. Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.
由《巴利莫特之书》的作者德罗马的所罗门和马努斯·托马尔塔赫·麦克唐诺创作的珍贵且绣有精美刺绣的古代爱尔兰面巾随后经过精心制作，并引起了长期的钦佩。无需细想角落装饰的传奇之美，艺术的巅峰，人们可以清楚地辨别出四位福音传教士中的每一位，依次向四位大师中的每一位展示他的福音派标志，一根博戈克权杖，一只北美美洲狮（一只美洲狮）。顺便说一下，比英国文章高贵得多的百兽之王），一头克里小牛和一只来自卡兰托山的金雕。墓地上描绘的场景，展示了我们古老的邓恩、拉斯、克罗姆莱奇、格里诺恩、学问和诅咒石的座位，这些场景都非常美丽，颜料也像很久以前斯莱戈照明师尽情发挥他们的艺术幻想一样精美。在Barmecides时代。格兰达洛 (Glendalough)、基拉尼 (Killarney) 美丽的湖泊、克朗马克诺伊斯 (Clonmacnois) 遗址、康恩修道院 (Cong Abbey)、格伦伊纳 (Glen Inagh) 和十二针山 (Twelve Pins)、爱尔兰之眼 (Ireland's Eye)、塔拉特 (Tallaght) 的青山、克罗帕特里克 (Croagh Patrick)、亚瑟·吉尼斯 (Arthur Guinness) 先生及其儿子和公司 (Limited) 啤酒厂、湖内伊河岸、奥沃卡谷、伊索尔德塔、马帕斯方尖碑、帕特里克·邓爵士医院、克利尔角、阿赫洛峡谷、林奇城堡、苏格兰房子、拉夫林斯敦的拉斯当联合济贫院、塔拉莫尔监狱、卡斯尔康内尔急流、基尔巴利麦克肖纳基尔、位于莫纳斯特博伊斯 (Monasterboice) 十字路口，朱里酒店 (Jury's Hotel)，S. 帕特里克炼狱、鲑鱼跃、梅努斯学院食堂、柯利洞、第一任惠灵顿公爵的三个出生地、卡舍尔岩石、艾伦沼泽、亨利街仓库、芬格尔洞穴——所有这些动人的场景仍然存在。今天的我们，因流过他们的悲伤之水和时间的丰富而变得更加美丽。

—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
——让我们看看饮料，我说。哪个是哪个？

—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
——那是我的，乔说，就像魔鬼对死去的警察说的那样。

—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.
——布鲁姆说，我也属于一个被仇恨和迫害的种族。现在也是。就在这一刻。这非常即时。

Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.
天哪，他的旧雪茄烟蒂差点烫伤了他的手指。

—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.
——被抢劫了，他说。被掠夺。被侮辱了。受迫害。理所应当地拿走属于我们的东西。就在此时此刻，他举起拳头说道，他在摩洛哥像奴隶或牛一样被拍卖。

—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
——你是在谈论新耶路撒冷吗？这位公民说。

—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.
——我说的是不公正，布鲁姆说。

—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
——是的，约翰·怀斯说。然后像男人一样用力量挺身而出。

That’s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he’d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.
这是给你的年历图片。标记软头子弹。老猪脸站在枪的末端。天哪，他会装饰一把扫帚，所以他会的，只要他身上只有一条护士围裙。然后他突然倒下，反向扭动，像一块湿抹布一样瘫软。

—But it’s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.
——但这没有用，他说。武力、仇恨、历史，所有这些。这不是男人和女人的生活，侮辱和仇恨。每个人都知道这与真正的生活截然相反。

—What? says Alf.
-什么？阿尔夫说。

—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second. Just a moment.
——爱，布鲁姆说。我的意思是仇恨的反面。我现在必须走了，他对约翰·怀斯说。去球场看看马丁是否在场。如果他来了，就说我一会儿就回来。一会儿。

Who’s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.
谁在阻碍你？然后他就像涂了油的闪电一样突然弹出。

—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
——这位公民说，一位外邦人的新使徒。博爱。

—Well, says John Wyse. Isn’t that what we’re told. Love your neighbour.
——嗯，约翰·怀斯说。这不是我们被告知的吗？爱你的邻居。

—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.
——那个家伙？这位公民说。以邻为壑是他的座右铭。爱，莫亚！他是罗密欧与朱丽叶的典范。

Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.
爱爱爱爱。护士很喜欢新来的药剂师。 14A 警员喜欢玛丽·凯利。格蒂·麦克道威尔喜欢那个拥有自行车的男孩。 M.B.喜欢一位公正的绅士。李智涵 (Li Chi Han) 与Cha Pu Chow 亲吻。大象珍宝喜欢大象爱丽丝。长着喇叭的老弗斯乔伊尔先生爱着眼睛翻过来的老弗斯乔伊尔夫人。穿棕色麦金塔电脑的男人爱上了一位死去的女士。国王陛下爱女王陛下。诺曼·W·塔珀夫人喜爱泰勒警官。你爱某个人。这个人爱另一个人，因为每个人都爱某人，但上帝爱每个人。

—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.
——好吧，乔，我说，你身体健康，唱歌也很好。更多权力，公民。

—Hurrah, there, says Joe.
——万岁，就在那里，乔说。

—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
——上帝、玛丽和帕特里克对你的祝福，公民说。

And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.
他举起一品脱啤酒来润湿他的哨子。

—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?
——我们知道那些慢跑，他说，一边说教一边偷窃。那么道貌岸然的克伦威尔和他的铁甲党又如何呢？他们将德罗赫达的妇女和儿童置于刀剑之下，并在他的炮口上贴上了《上帝就是爱》的文字？圣经！你今天读过《爱尔兰联合报》上有关祖鲁族酋长访问英格兰的小品吗？

—What’s that? says Joe.
-那是什么？乔说。

So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:
于是，这位公民拿起他的一张随身物品，开始宣读：

—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.
——昨天，曼彻斯特主要棉花巨头代表团由沃库普鸡蛋沃库普勋爵金棒在等待中，向阿贝库塔阿拉基国王陛下致以衷心感谢英国贸易商为他们提供的便利。他的领土。代表团参加了午餐会，午餐结束时，这位肤色黝黑的君主在由英国牧师阿纳尼亚斯·赞美神·巴雷博内斯牧师免费翻译的愉快讲话中，向马萨·沃库普致以最诚挚的谢意，并强调了阿比库塔与阿比库塔之间存在的友好关系。和大英帝国，声称他珍视一本插图圣经，这是一本上帝话语的书，也是英国伟大的秘密的一本，是他最珍贵的财产之一，是由白人酋长、伟大的女人维多利亚慷慨地赠送给他的，来自皇家捐赠者威严之手的个人奉献。随后，阿拉基人喝了一杯充满爱意的第一杯乌斯奎堡酒，以敬酒，敬酒时取自他的前任卡卡查卡查克王朝的前任，姓四十疣的头骨，之后他参观了棉花城的主要工厂，并在访客登记簿上签下了自己的标记，随后，他表演了一种迷人的阿比库蒂克古老的舞蹈，在女孩们热烈的掌声中，他吞下了几把刀叉。

—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.
——寡妇，内德说。我不会怀疑她。想知道他是否像我一样使用那本圣经。

—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.
——莱内汉说，同样如此。此后，在那片肥沃的土地上，阔叶芒果生长得非常茂盛。

—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
——这是格里菲斯写的吗？约翰怀斯说。

—No, says the citizen. It’s not signed Shanganagh. It’s only initialled: P.
——不，公民说。上面没有署名“Shanganagh”。只是缩写：P。

—And a very good initial too, says Joe.
——而且首字母也非常好，乔说。

—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
——这就是它的运作方式，这位公民说。贸易跟随旗帜。

—Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is?
——好吧，J.J. 说，如果他们比刚果自由邦的比利时人更糟糕，那他们一定很糟糕。你读过那个男人的报告吗？他叫什么名字？

—Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.
——凯斯门特，公民说。他是爱尔兰人。

—Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.
——是的，就是这个男人，J.J. 说。他强奸了妇女和女孩，并鞭打当地人的腹部，以榨干他们身上所有的红色橡胶。

—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
——我知道他去了哪里，莱内汉打着响指说道。

—Who? says I.
-WHO？我说。

—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.
——布鲁姆，他说。法院大楼是盲人。他在 Throwaway 上有一些鲍勃，现在他去收谢克尔了。

—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?
——是那个白眼非洲人吗？那位公民说，他一生中从未在愤怒中支持过马？

—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.
——莱内汉说，他就去了那里。我遇到班塔姆·里昂斯（Bantam Lyons）打算支持那匹马，但我阻止了他，他告诉我布鲁姆给了他小费。你敢打赌，他有一百先令比五先令。他是都柏林唯一拥有它的人。一匹黑马。

—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
——乔说，他自己就是一匹该死的黑马。

—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
——请注意，乔，我说。给我们看看出口。

—There you are, says Terry.
——你来了，特里说。

Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she’s better or she’s (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.
再见爱尔兰，我要去戈特。所以我就绕到院子后面去泵船和贝戈布（一百先令到五），当我放下我的（扔掉二十先令）放下我的负载时，戈布对自己说，我知道他对他的（两品脱）感到不安乔的一个和斯莱特里的一个）在他的脑海里要偏离目标（一百先令是五英镑），当他们在（黑马）小便时伯克告诉我卡片聚会并让孩子病了（天哪，一定做了大约一加仑）一个软弱的妻子在管子里说她更好了或者她（噢！）所有的计划都是这样，如果他赢了，他就可以用游泳池来迷失，或者（天哪，我已经满了）交易没有许可证（噢！）爱尔兰，我的国家说他（hoik！phthook！）永远不会对付那些该死的（这是最后一个）耶路撒冷（啊！）杜鹃。

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one.
无论如何，当我回来的时候，他们正忙着呢，约翰·怀斯说是布鲁姆把新芬党的想法交给了格里菲斯，让格里菲斯在他的报纸上写了各种各样的偷工减料、挤满陪审团、骗取政府税收和任命所有执政官的内容。走遍世界各地推销爱尔兰工业。抢彼得来付钱给保罗。哎呀，如果那双老邋遢的眼睛把演出搞砸了，那就太该死了。给我们一个该死的机会。愿上帝保佑爱尔兰免遭那些该死的老鼠之类的祸害。布卢姆先生和他的阿戈尔巴戈尔。还有他之前的老伙计，老伙计，老麦土撒勒姆·布鲁姆，那个抢劫的推销员，在带着他的小玩意和便士钻石淹没了这个国家后，用氢氰酸毒死了自己。邮寄贷款，条件宽松。手头预付的任何金额的款项。距离没有物体。没有安全感。天哪，他就像兰蒂·麦克海尔的山羊一样，会和每个人一起走一段路。

—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
——嗯，这是事实，约翰·怀斯说。现在有一个人可以告诉你这一切，马丁·坎宁安。

Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense.
果然，城堡车开过来了，马丁在车上，杰克·鲍尔和他一起，还有一个叫克罗夫特或克罗夫顿的家伙，来自征收将军的养老金领取者，登记册上确实有一个橙色人布莱克本，他拿着工资，或者克劳福德在全国各地游荡。以国王的费用。

Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.
我们的旅客到达乡村旅馆并下了马。

—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!
——嗬，小家伙！他喊道，从他的神态来看，他似乎是这支队伍的领袖。猥琐流氓！对我们来说！

So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
说着，他用剑柄敲打着敞开的格子。

Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.
我的主人应召而来，给他穿上了战袍。

—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
——给你们一个好巢穴，我的主人，他谄媚地鞠了一躬。

—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.
——振作起来，先生！敲门的人喊道。看看我们的马。对于我们自己来说，如果我们需要的话，请给我们最好的帮助。

—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.
——拉卡迪，好主人，主人说，我可怜的房子只有一个空荡荡的食品储藏室。我不知道该向大人提供什么。

—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?
——现在怎么样，伙计？队伍中第二个面容和蔼可亲的人喊道，塔普顿大人，你是国王的使者吗？

An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.
房东的脸色瞬间发生了变化。

—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.
——先生们，请怜悯吧，他谦虚地说。如果你是国王的使者（愿上帝保佑陛下！），你将一无所缺。我保证，国王的朋友们（上帝保佑国王陛下！）不会在我的家里禁食。

—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?
——那么关于！没有说话的旅行者喊道，从他的外表来看，他是一个精力旺盛的贪吃者。有什么可以给我们的吗？

Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
矿主再次鞠躬回答道：

—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?
——各位好主人，对于乳鸽馅饼、鹿肉块、小牛肉、猪肋排配脆猪培根、野猪头配开心果、一盆快乐蛋奶冻、一杯枸杞艾菊和一壶陈年酒，您有何看法？莱尼什？

—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
——小鬼！最后一位发言者喊道。那很喜欢我。开心果！

—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ‘Tis a merry rogue.
——啊哈！他对着那张令人愉快的面容喊道。简陋的房子和空荡荡的食品储藏室，哎呀！这是一个快乐的盗贼。

So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.
马丁进来问布鲁姆在哪里。

—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
-他在哪里？莱内汉说。诈骗寡妇和孤儿。

—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?
——约翰·怀斯说，我向公民讲述的关于布鲁姆和新芬党的事，这不是事实吗？

—That’s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
——正是如此，马丁说。或者说他们是这么声称的。

—Who made those allegations? says Alf.
——这些指控是谁提出的？阿尔夫说。

—I, says Joe. I’m the alligator.
——我，乔说。我是鳄鱼。

—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow?
——约翰·怀斯说，毕竟，为什么犹太人不能像其他人一样热爱自己的国家呢？

—Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.
-为什么不？当 J.J. 非常确定那是哪个国家时，他说道。

—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.
——他是犹太人、外邦人、神圣罗马人还是襁褓中的人，还是他到底是什么？内德说。或者说他是谁？无意冒犯，克罗夫顿。

—Who is Junius? says J. J.
——朱尼厄斯是谁？ J. J. 说

—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
——我们不需要他，橙人或长老会教徒克罗夫特说。

—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.
——马丁说，他是一个变态的犹太人，来自匈牙利的一个地方，所有的计划都是他根据匈牙利的制度制定的。我们在城堡里就知道了。

—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
——他不是牙医布鲁姆的表弟吗？杰克·鲍尔说。

—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.
——一点也不，马丁说。仅同名。他的名字叫维拉格，是服毒的父亲的名字。他通过契约改变了它，父亲也这么做了。

—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!
——这就是爱尔兰的新弥赛亚！这位公民说。圣贤之岛！

—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.
——嗯，他们仍在等待他们的救赎者，马丁说。就此而言，我们也是如此。

—Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he’s a father or a mother.
——是的，J.J. 说，每个出生的男性都认为这可能是他们的弥赛亚。我相信，每个犹太人都处于高度兴奋的状态，直到他知道自己是父亲还是母亲。

—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
——莱内汉说，期待每一刻都将是他的下一刻。

—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.
——哦，上帝啊，内德说，你应该在布鲁姆死去的儿子出生之前就见过他。有一天，我在南部城市市场遇到了他，当时我在妻子临产前六周买了一罐尼夫的食物。

—En ventre sa mère, says J. J.
—En ventre sa mère，J. J. 说道。

—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
——你管那叫男人吗？这位公民说。

—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
——我想知道他有没有把它放在看不见的地方，乔说。

—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
——好吧，无论如何，有两个孩子出生了，杰克·鲍尔说。

—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
——他怀疑谁？这位公民说。

Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I’m telling you? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.
天哪，有很多真话都是开玩笑说的。他就是那些混杂的中产阶级之一。皮瑟每个月躺在旅馆里告诉我一次，她的课程让我头痛得像个小孩子。你知道我在告诉你什么吗？抓住这样的人，把他扔进血海里，简直就是天意。正当杀人，就这样吧。然后带着他的五英镑溜走，没有像个男人那样放一品脱东西。给我们你的祝福。不至于蒙蔽你的眼睛。

—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can’t wait.
——对邻居仁慈，马丁说。但他在哪里？我们等不及了。

—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. That’s what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.
——公民说，是披着羊皮的狼。他就是这样。来自匈牙利的维拉格！我称他为亚哈随鲁。被上帝诅咒了。

—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
——马丁，你有时间喝点酒吗？内德说。

—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
——只有一个，马丁说。我们必须快点。 J.J.和S.

—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
——你，杰克？克罗夫顿？三个半，特里。

—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.
——在允许类似的事情污染我们的海岸后，这位公民说，圣帕特里克希望再次登陆巴利金拉并改变我们的信仰。

—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.
——好吧，马丁一边说，一边敲击着他的杯子。我祈祷上帝保佑这里的所有人。

—Amen, says the citizen.
——阿门，公民说。

—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.
——我相信他会的，乔说。

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.

And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.

—And so say all of us, says Jack.
——我们所有人都这么说，杰克说。

—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.

—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.

I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.
我只是环顾四周，看看谁会在该死的时候想到快乐的想法，但他又来了，表现得非常匆忙。

—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I’m not …
——我刚刚在法院附近，他说，正在找你。我希望我不是……

—No, says Martin, we’re ready.
——不，马丁说，我们已经准备好了。

Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There’s a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.
我的眼睛和你的口袋里挂满了金银。意味着该死的伤口。请我们喝一杯。魔鬼，甜蜜的恐惧！有一个犹太人适合你！一切都是为了第一。可爱得像只茅屋里的老鼠。百比五。

—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen,
——不要告诉任何人，该公民说，

—Beg your pardon, says he.
——请原谅，他说。

—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
——来吧，孩子们，马丁说，看到它看起来是蓝色的。现在就来吧。

And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.
那条该死的狗醒了，发出一声咆哮。

—Bye bye all, says Martin.

—-Off with you, says
----随你而去，说

Martin to the jarvey.
马丁对贾维。

The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.
乳白色的海豚甩动着鬃毛，舵手在金色的船尾升起，将腹帆迎风展开，所有帆都挂在船头，从三角帆到左舷。许多美丽的仙女靠近右舷和左舷，紧贴着高贵的树皮的两侧，它们将自己闪亮的形状连接在一起，就像狡猾的轮匠在他的轮子的中心周围塑造等距离的光线一样，每个人都是姐妹另一个，他用外环把它们全部绑起来，当男人们骑马去参加宴会或争夺女士们的微笑时，他会加快他们的脚步。即便如此，她们还是来安置了她们，那些心甘情愿的仙女，那些不朽的姐妹。他们大笑着，在泡沫中嬉戏：树皮拍打着波浪。

But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.
但天哪，我刚刚放下酒杯，就看到那个公民起身摇摇晃晃地走到门口，气喘吁吁，浑身浮肿，他用爱尔兰语咒骂克伦威尔对他的诅咒，钟声、书本和蜡烛，吐着口水。然后他、乔和小阿尔夫就向他吐口水，像小妖精一样围着他，试图让他平静下来。

—Let me alone, says he.
——别管我，他说。

And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:
结果他一直走到门口，他们抓住了他，他嚎啕大哭起来：

—Three cheers for Israel!
——为以色列欢呼三声！

Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there’s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.
啊啊，看在上帝的份上，坐在你屁股的议会一侧，不要公开展示你自己。天哪，总有一些该死的小丑或其他人在毫无血腥的事情上煽动一场血腥的谋杀。天哪，它会让你的胃里的搬运工变酸，所以它会的。

And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:
全国所有的衣衫褴褛和荡妇都围在门口，马丁叫贾维开车走在前面，市民们大喊大叫，阿尔夫和乔向他吹口哨，他趾高气扬地谈论犹太人和游手好闲的人要求发表演讲，而杰克权力试图让他坐在车上，按住他血淋淋的下巴，一只眼睛上蒙着眼罩的乐福鞋开始唱歌，如果月亮上的男人是犹太人，犹太人，犹太人，还有一个荡妇从她的嘴里喊道：

—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
——呃，先生！你的苍蝇已经打开了，先生！

And says he:
他说：

—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.
——门德尔松是犹太人，卡尔·马克思、梅尔卡丹特和斯宾诺莎也是。救世主是犹太人，他的父亲也是犹太人。你的上帝。

—He had no father, says Martin. That’ll do now. Drive ahead.
——他没有父亲，马丁说。现在就可以了。向前行驶。

—Whose God? says the citizen.
——谁的上帝？这位公民说。

—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.
——嗯，他叔叔是犹太人，他说。你的上帝是犹太人。基督和我一样是犹太人。

Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.
哎呀，这位公民又一头扎进了商店。

—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.
——上帝啊，他说，我会责怪那个该死的犹太人使用这个圣名。

By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.
以耶稣的名义，我会把他钉在十字架上，所以我会的。把饼干盒给我们。

—Stop! Stop! says Joe.
-停止！停止！乔说。

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy’s March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontlátásra, kedves baráton! Visszontlátásra! Gone but not forgotten.
来自都柏林和都柏林大区的数千名朋友和熟人聚集在一起，在亚历山大·托姆先生的已故印刷工亚历山大·托姆先生启程前往遥远的欧洲之际向他告别。 Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas（潺潺水草甸）。仪式在盛大的气氛中进行，其特点是最感人的诚挚。一幅由爱尔兰艺术家创作的带有插图的古爱尔兰牛皮纸卷轴，被代表社区的大部分人赠送给这位杰出的现象学家，并附有一个银棺材的礼物，该银棺材以古代凯尔特装饰风格精心制作，这部作品充分体现了创作者雅各布·阿古斯·雅各布先生的功劳。离开的客人受到了热烈的掌声，当精选的爱尔兰管弦乐团演奏出著名的《回到艾琳》曲调，紧接着是拉科奇的进行曲时，许多在场的人明显被感动了。沿着四海海岸线，霍斯山、三石山、舒格洛夫山、布雷海德山、莫恩山、加尔蒂斯山、奥克斯山、多尼戈尔山、斯佩林山、纳格尔斯山和斯佩林山的山顶上都点燃了焦油桶和篝火。博格拉斯、康尼马拉山、M Gillicuddy、Slieve Aughty、Slieve Bernagh 和 Slieve Bloom 的恶臭。 在欢呼声中，远处寒武纪和喀里多尼亚山上一大群追随者的欢呼声回应了这艘乳齿象的快乐船慢慢地离开了，在场的女性代表最后献上了鲜花致敬。当它在驳船队的护送下顺河而下时，压舱物办公室和海关的旗帜以及鸽子屋和普尔贝格灯塔的发电站的旗帜都降下了敬礼。 Visszontlátásra，kedves baráton！ Visszontlátásra！走了但没有忘记。

Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre:
天哪，魔鬼不会阻止他，除非他无论如何都抓住了那个该死的罐子，然后和他一起出去，小阿尔夫抓住了他的肘部，他像一头被困住的猪一样大喊，就像女王皇家剧院里的任何血腥戏剧一样好：

—Where is he till I murder him?
——在我谋杀他之前他在哪里？

And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.
内德和 J.J. 笑得瘫痪了。

—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.
——血腥的战争，我说，我将参加最后的福音。

But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him.
但幸运的是，贾维把那匹马的头转过来，带着他走了。

—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
——等等，公民，乔说。停止！

Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.
贝戈布伸出手来，一挥，飞了出去。上帝仁慈，阳光照在他的眼睛里，否则他就丢下他等死了。天啊，他差点就把它送到朗福德郡了。那该死的老马吓坏了，老杂种跟在汽车后面，就像该死的地狱一样，所有的民众又喊又笑，旧铁盒在街上叮当作响。

The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of débris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall’s light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus.

这场灾难的影响是可怕的、瞬间的。邓辛克天文台记录了全部 11 次地震，全部为麦卡利震级第五级，自 1534 年（西尔肯·托马斯叛乱那年）地震以来，我们岛上没有任何类似地震扰动的记录。震中似乎是大都市的一部分，由旅馆码头区和圣米尚教区组成，占地四十一英亩，有两根路和一根方杆或栖息处。司法宫附近的所有贵族住宅都被拆除了，而在灾难发生时，重要的法律辩论正在进行中的那座高贵的建筑本身实际上是一堆废墟，在它下面，令人恐惧的是所有的居住者已被活埋。根据目击者的报告，地震波伴随着气旋性的剧烈大气扰动。一件头饰已被确定属于备受尊敬的王室与和平书记员乔治·福特雷尔先生，还有一把金柄丝质雨伞，上面刻有这位博学而受人尊敬的季度会议主席的姓名首字母、徽章、徽章和门牌号都柏林记录员弗雷德里克·福尔金纳爵士分别被搜索队在岛上偏远地区发现，前者在巨人堤道的第三玄武岩山脊上，后者埋在都柏林的沙滩上一英尺三英寸的地方。位于金塞尔旧海角附近的 Holeopen 湾。其他目击者称，他们观察到一个巨大的白炽物体以可怕的速度沿着西南偏西的轨迹冲过大气层。 每小时都会收到来自各大洲各地的哀悼和同情信息，教宗仁慈地颁布法令，所有主教教区的每座大教堂的普通人员应同时庆祝特别的弥撒临终弥撒服从罗马教廷的精神权威，对那些意外地被召回我们中间的忠实离世者的灵魂进行选举。打捞、清除碎片、人体遗骸等工作已委托给位于 Great Brunswick 街 159 号的 Michael Meade 父子先生以及北墙 77、78、79 和 80 号的 T. 和 C. Martin 先生，并由人员协助康沃尔公爵的轻步兵军官，由海军少将 H. R. H.、赫拉克勒斯·汉尼拔·汉尼拔·安德森爵士阁下指挥，K. G.、K. P.、K. T.、P. C.、K. C. B.、M. P、J. P.、M. B.、D. S. O.、S. O. D. ，M.F.H.，M.R.I.A.，B.L.，Mus。 Doc.、P. L. G.、F. T. C. D.、F. R. U.

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.
你从来没有在你天生的气焰中见过类似的东西。天啊，如果他在民意调查中拿到了那张彩票，他就会记住金杯，他会的，但天哪，这个公民会因为攻击和殴打而被追上，而乔会因为协助和教唆而被追上。贾维通过猛烈的驾驶救了他的命，就像上帝创造了摩西一样。什么？噢，耶稣，他做到了。他在身后咒骂了一连串。

—Did I kill him, says he, or what?
——他说，是我杀了他，还是什么？

And he shouting to the bloody dog:
他对着那条该死的狗喊道：

—After him, Garry! After him, boy!
——跟着他，加里！追他吧，孩子！

And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.
我们最后看到的是那辆该死的汽车拐过街角，上面有一张老羊脸在打手势，而那该死的杂种狗则用后背追赶着它，尽管他非常值得把他撕成碎片。百比五！天哪，他剥夺了他的价值，我向你保证。

When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.
看啊，当他们周围出现一道巨大的光辉时，他们看到耶稣所站的战车升入天堂。他们看见他坐在战车上，身穿光辉的荣耀，衣着如太阳，美丽如月亮，可怕得他们不敢正视他。从天上有声音呼喊：以利亚！以利亚！他以一声主要的呼喊来回答：阿爸！阿多奈！他们甚至看到了他，本·布卢姆·以利亚，在天使云彩中，以四十五度角上升到小格林街多诺霍的光辉荣耀中，就像从铲子上射出的一枪。

The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.
夏日的傍晚开始将世界包裹在神秘的怀抱中。遥远的西边，太阳正在落山，转瞬即逝的白昼的最后一丝余辉可爱地徘徊在大海和海岸上，在亲爱的老霍斯骄傲的海角上，一如既往地守卫着海湾的水域，在桑迪山海岸长满杂草的岩石上，最后但并非最不重要的一点是，在安静的教堂里，在寂静中时不时地传来向她祈祷的声音，她纯洁的光辉是永远照亮人心的灯塔，玛利亚，海洋之星。

The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.
三个闺蜜坐在岩石上，享受着傍晚的景色和清新但不太寒冷的空气。很多时候，他们常常会来到那个最喜欢的角落，在波光粼粼的海浪旁舒适地聊天，讨论女性问题，西西·卡弗里和伊迪·博德曼带着婴儿车里的婴儿，还有汤米和杰克·卡弗里，两个卷发小男孩身着水手服，戴着与之相配的帽子，名字上写着 H.M.S. Belleisle 印在两者上。对汤米和杰基·卡弗里来说，他们是双胞胎，才四岁，有时非常吵闹，被宠坏了，但对于那些可爱的小家伙来说，他们有着明亮快乐的面孔和可爱的举止。他们用铁锹和水桶在沙子里嬉戏，像孩子一样建造城堡，或者玩他们的大彩球，快乐得就像白天一样漫长。伊迪·博德曼（Edy Boardman）在手推车里摇晃着胖乎乎的婴儿，而那位年轻的绅士则高兴地咯咯笑。他只有十一个月零九天大，虽然还是个小孩子，但刚刚开始口齿不清地说出他的第一句话。西茜·卡弗里向他弯下腰，逗弄他肥硕的小勇气和下巴上精致的酒窝。

—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.
——现在，宝贝，西西·卡弗里说。说大就大。我想喝点水。

And baby prattled after her:
婴儿在她身后喋喋不休地说：

—A jink a jink a jawbo.
——叮当叮当，叮叮当当。

Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.
西西·卡弗里 (Cissy Caffrey) 拥抱着这个小家伙，因为她非常喜欢孩子，对小病人很有耐心，而汤米·卡弗里 (Tommy Caffrey) 永远不可能接受他的蓖麻油，除非是西西·卡弗里 (Cissy Caffrey) 捏着他的鼻子，向他许诺给他面包的碎脚跟，或者涂有金色糖浆的黑面包。这姑娘的说服力何其强大啊！但可以肯定的是，小博德曼就像金子一样，是他新奇特围兜里的完美小宠儿。你们那些被宠坏的美女，弗洛拉·麦克弗利姆西之类的，都不是西西·卡弗里。心地善良的姑娘从来没有吸过生命的气息，吉普赛般的眼睛里总是带着笑意，樱桃熟的红唇上总是带着嬉闹的话语，可爱到极点的女孩。伊迪·博德曼也被弟弟的古怪语言逗笑了。

But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.
但就在这时，汤米少爷和杰基少爷之间发生了轻微的口角。男孩就是男孩，我们的两个双胞胎也不例外。不和谐的苹果是杰基大师建造的一座沙堡，汤米大师会希望它能像马泰洛塔那样在建筑上进行改进，增加一个前门。但是，如果说汤米大师是任性的，那么杰基大师也是任性的，而且，正如每一个爱尔兰小人的房子都是他的城堡的格言一样，他向他可恶的对手发起攻击，并达到了这样的目的，以至于潜在的袭击者陷入了悲痛之中，并且（唉，联系起来！）还有令人垂涎的城堡。不用说，汤米少爷狼狈的叫声引起了女朋友们的注意。

—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.
——过来，汤米，他妹妹命令般地喊道。立刻！还有你，杰基，羞愧地将可怜的汤米扔进肮脏的沙子里。等我抓住你。

His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure. His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.
汤米大师应她的召唤来到了他的眼睛，泪水模糊了，因为他们的姐姐的话对双胞胎来说就是法律。在他的不幸遭遇之后，他也陷入了悲伤的困境。他的小战舰上衣和难以形容的东西都沾满了沙子，但西西是一位过去的情妇，善于消除生活中的小麻烦，很快他漂亮的小西装上就看不到一粒沙子了。蓝色的眼睛仍然闪烁着即将涌出的滚烫泪水，所以她吻掉了伤害，并向罪魁祸首杰基大师握手，说如果她靠近他，她就不会远离他，她的眼睛在警告中跳舞。

—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.
——可恶的大胆杰基！她哭了。

She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
她用一只手臂搂住小水手，迷人地哄道：

—What’s your name? Butter and cream?
-你叫什么名字？黄油和奶油？

—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?
——告诉我们谁是你的爱人，伊迪·博德曼说道。西西是你的爱人吗？

—Nao, tearful Tommy said.
——不，汤米泪流满面地说。

—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.
——伊迪·博德曼是你的甜心吗？西西问道。

—Nao, Tommy said.
——不，汤米说。

—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart.
——我知道，伊迪·博德曼用她那双近视的眼睛扫了一眼，语气不太和蔼可亲地说。我知道谁是汤米的情人。格蒂是汤米的甜心。

—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.
——不，汤米快要哭了。

Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.
西西的聪明才智猜到出了什么问题，她低声告诉伊迪·博德曼，把他带到手推车后面，那位绅士看不到的地方，并注意他没有弄湿他的新棕褐色鞋子。

But who was Gerty?
但格蒂是谁？

Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.
格蒂·麦克道威尔坐在她的同伴旁边，陷入沉思，凝视着远方，事实上，她是人们希望看到的迷人爱尔兰少女时代的典范。所有认识她的人都称赞她很漂亮，但正如人们常说的那样，她更像是吉尔特拉普而不是麦克道尔。她的身材纤细而优雅，甚至有些脆弱，但她最近服用的那些铁胶体对她的好处比韦尔奇寡妇的女性药丸要好得多，而且她比以前的那些分泌物要好得多，而且疲倦的感觉。她蜡质苍白的脸像象牙一样纯洁，几乎具有灵性，尽管她的玫瑰花蕾般的嘴巴是真正的丘比特之弓，希腊式的完美。她的手是雪花石膏般的，纹理细腻，手指逐渐变细，洁白得像柠檬汁和无数药膏一样，尽管她以前在床上并不戴小山羊皮手套，也不用牛奶泡脚。伯莎·苏普尔有一次对伊迪·博德曼说过，这是一个故意的谎言，当时她被格蒂拔出的匕首吓得昏了过去（这两个女孩的好友当然和其他凡人一样，时不时会发生小争吵），她告诉她不要让无论她做了什么，都是她告诉她的，否则她就再也不会和她说话了。不，该荣誉的荣誉。格蒂有一种与生俱来的优雅，一种慵懒的女王般的傲慢，这在她精致的双手和高高的脚背上得到了明显的体现。 命运善良，但愿她生来就是一位高学历的淑女，如果她接受了良好的教育，格蒂·麦克道威尔可能会轻松地与这个国家的任何女士并肩而立，并看到自己穿着精致的礼服。她额头上的珠宝和她脚下的贵族追求者们竞相向她表达他们的敬意。也许正是这种爱，也许就是这种爱，让她那柔和的面庞上时不时流露出一种紧张而压抑的神情，让那双美丽的眼睛流露出一种奇怪的渴望倾向，一种很少有人能抗拒的魅力。为什么女人的眼睛那么有魔力？格蒂的头发是最蓝的爱尔兰蓝色，衬托出有光泽的睫毛和富有表现力的深色眉毛。曾经，那些眉毛不再那么丝滑诱人。正是《中篇公主》的“美丽女人”版块的女主管维拉·维蒂夫人首先建议她尝试眉毛，这种眉毛赋予眼睛令人难以忘怀的表情，因此成为了时尚界的领导者，而她也从未后悔过。那么脸红是科学治愈的，如何长高才能拥有漂亮的脸蛋但鼻子呢？这很适合迪格纳姆太太，因为她有一颗纽扣。但格蒂最大的荣耀是她美丽的头发。它是深棕色的，里面有自然的波浪。那天早上，她因为新月的缘故把头发剪掉了，头发簇拥在她美丽的脑袋上，周围长满了茂密的一簇簇头发，周四她还为了财富而剪掉了指甲。刚才听到伊迪的话，她的脸颊上泛起一抹明显的红晕，精致得像最淡的玫瑰花一样，她甜美的少女般的羞涩看起来是如此可爱，可以肯定，上帝的美丽土地爱尔兰无法与她相媲美。

For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel. As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.
一时之间，她沉默了，双眸低垂，颇为悲伤。她正想反驳，但话到嘴边却被什么东西止住了。倾向促使她说出来，尊严却让她保持沉默。漂亮的嘴唇撅起一会儿，但随后她抬起头来，爆发出一阵愉快的小笑，其中充满了五月早晨的新鲜气息。她很清楚，没有人比她更清楚，是什么让斜视的伊迪说出这样的话，因为他的注意力冷静了下来，而这只是一场恋人的争吵。和往常一样，有人对那个在伦敦桥路上骑着自行车总是在她窗前上上下下的男孩感到不舒服。只是现在，他的父亲让他在晚上努力学习，以便在中级考试中参加一场表演赛，当他像他参加赛车的兄弟 W. E. Wylie 一样离开高中时，他本来打算去三一学院攻读医生。在三一学院大学的自行车比赛中。他几乎没有意识到她的感受，有时她内心深处隐隐作痛的空虚感，刺入核心。然而他还年轻，也许他会及时学会爱她。他的家人都是新教徒，格蒂当然知道谁是第一位的，在他之后是圣母，然后是圣约瑟夫。 但不可否认的是，他很英俊，鼻子精致，而且他就是他的外表，每一寸都是绅士，他的头的形状也在后面，不戴帽子，她会知道任何地方的一些不寻常的东西以及他转动自行车的方式他的手离开了车把，站在灯前，还有那些好香烟的香味，而且他们俩的尺寸也一样，他和她，这就是为什么伊迪·博德曼认为她聪明得可怕，因为他没有去骑马在她的小花园前上上下下。

Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the Lady’s Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday.
格蒂穿着简单，但有着时尚达人的本能品味，因为她觉得他有可能出局。一件整洁的电蓝色衬衫，用多莉染料自染（因为《女士画报》中预计会穿电蓝色），带有漂亮的 V 字形开口，一直延伸到分隔和头巾口袋（她总是在里面放一块带有香味的棉绒）她最喜欢的香水，因为手帕破坏了坐姿）和一件剪裁合身的海军蓝四分之三裙子，完美地展示了她苗条优雅的身材。她戴着一顶风骚的小爱，宽叶黑草草制成的帽子，边缘饰有蛋蓝色绳绒线的下沿，旁边还系着蝴蝶结的丝绸蝴蝶结。整个星期二下午，她都在寻找与那条绳绒相配的衣服，但最后她在克莱里的夏季促销中找到了她想要的东西，正是它，有点被商店弄脏了，但你永远不会注意到，七个手指两个和一便士。这一切都是她自己做的，当她试穿时，对着镜子反射给她的可爱倒影微笑，她是多么高兴啊！当她把它放在水壶上以保持形状时，她知道这会让她认识的一些人失去光彩。她的鞋子是鞋类中最新的款式（伊迪·博德曼（Edy Boardman）为自己非常娇小而自豪，但她从来没有像格蒂·麦克道尔（Gerty MacDowell）那样的脚，五岁的脚，也永远不会选择白蜡木、橡木或榆木），鞋头是专利的，上面只有一个智能带扣脚背高。她的脚踝在裙子下展现出完美的比例，恰到好处的比例，她匀称的四肢不再被细纺长筒袜、高跟鞋和宽吊袜带包裹着。 至于内衣，它们是格蒂最关心的事情，谁知道甜蜜的十七岁的飘动的希望和恐惧（尽管格蒂再也见不到十七岁了）会在心里责怪她吗？她有四套小套装，缝线非常漂亮，另外还有三件衣服和睡衣，每套都镶有不同颜色的丝带，玫瑰粉色、淡蓝色、淡紫色和豌豆绿，当它们洗完回家后，她亲自将它们晾干并染成蓝色。熨烫它们时，她有一个砖棒来保持熨斗打开，因为她不相信那些洗衣女工，因为她会看到她们把东西烧焦。她穿蓝色衣服是为了运气，希望在希望中，她自己的颜色，对于一个新娘来说，身上有一点蓝色也是幸运的，因为她那天穿的绿色带来了悲伤，因为他的父亲带他去学习中间的展览，因为她认为也许他可能出去了，因为那天早上她穿衣服时，她差点把那双旧衣服翻过来，如果你把这些东西翻过来，或者如果它们得到了，那是为了运气和恋人会面。只要不是星期五，他就会想念你。

And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.
然而，然而！她脸上那紧张的表情！一种令人痛苦的悲伤始终存在。她的灵魂就在她的眼睛里，她愿意在她自己熟悉的房间的私密空间里付出一切，在那里，她可以痛哭一场，释放压抑的感情，尽管哭得不会太多，因为她知道如何哭得好听。镜子前。你很可爱，格蒂，它说。苍白的夜色照在一张无限悲伤和渴望的脸上。格蒂·麦克道威尔的渴望是徒劳的。是的，她从一开始就知道，她的白日梦婚姻已经安排好了，雷吉·怀利夫人 T.C.D. 的结婚钟声已经敲响（因为嫁给哥哥的人就是怀利夫人），而在时尚界，格特鲁德·怀利夫人是穿着一件华丽的灰色衣服，镶着昂贵的蓝色狐狸是不可以的。他还太小，无法理解。他不相信爱情，这个女人与生俱来的权利。很久以前，在斯托尔家举办的聚会之夜（他还穿着短裤），当时只有他们两个人，他用一只手臂搂住了她的腰，她的脸色变得苍白到了嘴唇。他用一种奇怪的沙哑的声音呼唤她的小宝贝，并抢下一个半吻（第一个！），但那只是她的鼻子末端，然后他匆匆离开房间，说了一些茶点。浮躁的家伙！坚强的性格从来都不是雷吉·威利的强项，而他若能吸引并赢得格蒂·麦克道威尔，他一定是男人中的男人。但是等待，总是等待被询问，而且这也是闰年，很快就会结束。 她的理想对象不是白马王子，而是一个有男子气概、面容坚强、安静的男人，他没有找到自己的理想，也许他的头发略带灰白，谁会理解并接纳她呢？他用双臂庇护着她，用他深沉热情的本性的全部力量将她拉向他，并用一个长长的吻安慰她。那就像天堂一样。她渴望这样一个温暖的夏夜。她全心全意地渴望成为他唯一的新娘，无论贫穷还是疾病，无论健康还是疾病，直到死亡我们都将分开，从现在到今天，成为他的未婚新娘。

And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.
当伊迪·博德曼和小汤米坐在手推车后面时，她只是在想，有一天她可以称自己为他的小妻子。然后他们就可以谈论她，直到他们脸色发青，还有伯莎·苏普尔，还有伊迪，小脾气，因为到十一月她就二十二岁了。她也会用物质上的舒适来照顾他，因为格蒂具有女性智慧，知道一个男人喜欢这种温馨的感觉。她做的金黄色煎饼和安女王制作的令人愉悦的奶油布丁赢得了所有人的好评，因为她还有一双幸运的手，会生火，撒上细细的自发面粉，总是朝同一个方向搅拌，然后给牛奶打奶油。和糖，搅拌均匀的蛋清，尽管她不喜欢吃的部分，因为有人让她害羞，她常常想知道为什么你不能吃一些像紫罗兰或玫瑰这样有诗意的东西，他们会有一个精美的布置客厅里摆满了图画和雕刻，还有爷爷吉尔特拉普的可爱狗加里欧文的照片，几乎说它是如此人性化，椅子上有印花棉布套，克莱里夏季杂货拍卖中的银色烤面包片就像在富人家里一样。他身材高大，肩膀宽阔（她一直很欣赏高个子男人做丈夫），精心修剪的大胡子下有洁白闪亮的牙齿，他们会去非洲大陆度蜜月（美妙的三个星期！），然后，当他们安顿下来时每天早上，他们都会在一个舒适温馨的小房子里，为自己的两个人吃早餐，简单但服务完美，在出去做生意之前，他会给他亲爱的小妻子一个衷心的拥抱和凝视。她的眼睛深处有一瞬间。

Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.
伊迪·博德曼（Edy Boardman）问汤米·卡弗里（Tommy Caffrey）他玩完了吗，他说是的，然后她为他扣上小灯笼裤的扣子，并告诉他跑出去和杰基（Jacky）一起玩，现在要乖一点，不要打架。但汤米说他想要这个球，伊迪告诉他不，宝宝正在玩球，如果他接了球，果岭上就会有假发，但汤米说这是他的球，他想要他的球，他在地上蹦蹦跳跳。 ， 如果你能够。他这脾气！哦，自从小汤米·卡弗里不再穿内裤后，他就已经是个男人了。伊迪告诉他不，不，现在就和他走吧，她告诉西西·卡弗里不要向他屈服。

—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.
——你不是我妹妹，淘气的汤米说。这是我的球。

But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.
但西西·卡弗里让小博德曼抬头看，高高地看着她的手指，她迅速抓住了球，把它扔到了沙子上，汤米全力追赶，赢得了胜利。

—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.
——为了安静的生活，什么都可以，西斯笑道。

And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.
她挠了挠小家伙的两个脸颊，让他忘记，然后扮演市长大人，这是他的两匹马，这是他的姜饼马车，他走进来，下巴，下巴，下巴。但伊迪对他如此随心所欲地对待每个人总是爱抚他感到非常生气。

—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.
——我想送点东西给他，她说，所以我就送了，但我不会说。

—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.
——在 Beeotetom 上，西西愉快地笑道。

Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.
格蒂·麦克道尔低下头，一想到西西大声说出这样不淑女的话，她就会为自己的人生感到羞愧，脸红了，脸红了，伊迪·博德曼说她确信对面的那位绅士听到了什么她说。但没有人关心西斯。

—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.
-让他！她俏皮地摇摇头，鼻子调皮地翘起。我一看到他，就在同一个地方把它也给他。

Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.
疯狂的西斯，有着一头呆萌的卷发。有时你不得不嘲笑她。例如，当她问你要不要再喝点中国茶和覆盆子公羊时，当她把罐子也画出来时，指甲上的男人脸用红墨水让你分裂，或者当她想去你知道的地方时，她说她想跑去拜访怀特小姐。这就像西西库姆一样。噢，你会忘记她那天晚上穿着她父亲的西装，戴着帽子，留着烧焦的软木小胡子，抽烟，沿着特里顿维尔路走。没有人来找她玩。但她本身就是真诚的，是上天创造的最勇敢、最真诚的心之一，而不是你的两面之物之一，过于甜蜜而无法健康。

And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.
然后空气中传来了人声和管风琴震耳欲聋的赞歌声。这是由传教士约翰·休斯·S.J.牧师主持的男士禁酒静修，念珠、布道和至圣圣事的祝福。在这个疲惫世界的风暴之后，他们聚集在一起，不分社会阶级（这是一个最有启发性的奇观），在海浪边那个简单的神殿里，在这个疲惫世界的风暴之后，跪在完美无瑕的脚前，背诵我们的连祷文。洛雷托夫人，恳求她为他们求情，古老熟悉的话语，圣母玛利亚，童女中的圣童贞女。可怜的格蒂的耳朵多么悲伤啊！如果她的父亲只是通过服用皮尔逊周刊上的承诺或那些治愈酗酒习惯的粉末来避免恶魔饮料的魔掌，她现在可能会在马车上滚动，这是首屈一指的。她一遍又一遍地告诉自己，当她在没有灯的棕色书房里沉思时，因为她讨厌两盏灯，或者时常梦幻般地凝视着窗外，看着雨点落在生锈的水桶上，思考着。但那股肮脏的汤剂毁掉了许多壁炉和家庭，给她的童年留下了阴影。不仅如此，她甚至亲眼目睹了家里因不节制而引发的暴力行为，还亲眼目睹了自己的父亲，一个醉酒的牺牲品，完全忘记了自己，因为如果格蒂知道一件事，那就是：男人向女人伸出手，除非是出于善意，否则就应该被贴上最低等的标签。

And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.
人们仍然在歌唱，祈求最强大、最仁慈的圣母玛利亚。格蒂全神贯注地思考着，很少看到或听到她的同伴或双胞胎孩子气的嬉戏，或桑迪蒙特绿地的那位绅士，西西·卡弗里称他为那个与他非常相似的人，沿着海岸散步了一小段路。你从来没有见过他以任何方式搞砸了，但尽管如此，她还是不喜欢他作为父亲，因为他太老了，或者其他什么，或者因为他的脸（这是费尔医生的一个明显的例子），或者他的红肿的鼻子，脸上长满了粉刺，鼻子下面的沙色胡须有点白。可怜的父亲！尽管他有种种缺点，当他唱着《告诉我，玛丽，如何向你求爱》或《我的爱和罗谢尔附近的小屋》时，她仍然爱着他。晚餐时，他们用拉赞比的沙拉酱炖了蛤蜊和生菜，当他唱着《月亮已与先生一起升起》时，她仍然爱着他。迪格纳姆因中风突然去世并被埋葬，上帝怜悯他。那天是她母亲的生日，查理放假回家，汤姆、迪格南先生、帕西夫人和弗雷迪·迪格南他们要带一群人去。没有人会想到末日已经如此临近。现在他已经安息了。她母亲对他说，让这成为他余生的一个警告，由于痛风，他甚至不能去参加葬礼，她不得不进城给他带来信件和样品。他的办公室采用 Catesby 的软木油毡，艺术、标准的设计，适合宫殿，给人顶级的穿着感，在家中总是明亮而愉快。

A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.
格蒂是一个纯正的好女儿，就像家里的第二个母亲一样，也是一个服务天使，有着一颗价值金子般的小心。当她母亲头痛欲裂时，是谁在她的额头上擦了薄荷醇锥，但格蒂虽然不喜欢她母亲吸鼻烟，但吸鼻烟是他们唯一说过的事情。每个人都因为她温柔的举止而对她刮目相看。每天晚上都是格蒂关掉总管的煤气，也是格蒂在那个地方的墙上钉上每两周一次的氯酸盐石灰，杂货商汤尼先生的圣诞年鉴，那是宁静日子的照片，在那里她永远不会忘记。年轻的绅士穿着当时的服装，戴着三角帽，正透过格子窗向他的爱人献上一束鲜花，充满了旧时的骑士精神。可见其背后是有故事的。颜色做得很可爱。她穿着一身柔和贴身的白色，神情严肃，而这位绅士则穿着巧克力色的衣服，看上去完全是个贵族。当她为了某种目的去那里时，她常常会出神地看着他们，感受自己的手臂，白皙柔软，就像她的手臂一样，袖子向后，回想起那些时光，因为她在沃克的发音词典中找到了属于吉尔特拉普爷爷的东西。关于太平日子的含义。

The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.
双胞胎现在以最受认可的兄弟方式进行比赛，直到最后杰基大师真的像黄铜一样大胆，没有落后，他故意用尽全力将球踢向海藻岩石。不用说，可怜的汤米很快就表达了他的沮丧，但幸运的是，独自坐在那里的黑衣绅士勇敢地伸出援手并拦截了球。我们的两位冠军大声叫喊着夺走了他们的玩具，为了避免麻烦，西西·卡弗里打电话给这位绅士，请把它扔给她。这位绅士瞄准了球一两次，然后把球沿着绳子扔向西西·卡弗里，但球滚下斜坡，停在岩石旁小水池附近的格蒂裙子下面。双胞胎再次吵闹着要球，西西让她把球踢开，让他们去争取，格蒂收回了脚，但她希望他们那愚蠢的球没有滚到她身上，她踢了一脚，但没踢中，伊迪西西笑了。

—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.
——如果你失败了，再试一次，伊迪·博德曼说。

Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.
格蒂微笑着表示同意，咬着嘴唇。精致的粉红色爬上她漂亮的脸颊，但她决心让他们看到，所以她只是稍微抬起裙子，但已经足够了，瞄准好，把球踢得很开心，球踢了这么远，两个双胞胎随后它向下朝向木瓦。当然，纯粹是嫉妒，并不是因为对面那位绅士的长相而引起注意。她感到一股温暖的红晕涌上她的脸颊，那是格蒂·麦克道威尔身上始终存在的危险信号。在那之前，他们只交换了最随意的眼神，但现在她在新帽子的帽檐下大胆地看了他一眼，暮色中与她目光相遇的那张脸，苍白而奇怪地憔悴，在她看来，这是她一生中最悲伤的一张脸。曾经见过。

Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.
透过教堂敞开的窗户，飘散着芬芳的香火，伴随着她的芬芳名字，她是在没有原罪玷污的情况下受孕的，精神容器，为我们祈祷，尊贵的容器，为我们祈祷，非凡奉献的容器，为我们祈祷我们，神秘的玫瑰。那里有忧心忡忡的心，为每天的面包而劳作，许多人犯了错误，迷失了方向，他们的眼睛因悔悟而湿润，但对所有那些充满希望的人来说，尊敬的父亲休斯神父告诉他们伟大的圣伯纳德在他著名的祈祷中所说的话圣母玛利亚，最虔诚的圣母玛利亚的代祷力量，在任何时代都没有记录到那些恳求她强大保护的人被她抛弃了。

The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.
双胞胎现在又快乐地玩耍了，因为童年的烦恼不过是转瞬即逝的夏日阵雨。西西·卡弗里 (Cissy Caffrey) 和婴儿博德曼 (Boardman) 一起玩耍，直到他高兴地欢呼雀跃，在空中拍着婴儿的手。窥视，她在手推车的引擎盖后面哭了，伊迪问西西去哪儿了，然后西西探出头哭啊！而且，我的话，这个小家伙不喜欢这样吗！然后她让他说爸爸。

—Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.
——说爸爸，宝贝。说啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪啪。

And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.
宝宝尽了最大的努力来表达这一点，因为每个人都说他非常聪明，十一个月了，而且相对于他的年龄和健康状况来说，他很聪明，是一群完美的爱，他们说他肯定会成为伟大的人物。 。

—Haja ja ja haja.
——哈贾贾贾哈贾。

Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
西西用流着口水的围嘴擦了擦他的小嘴，想让他坐起来说“爸爸爸爸爸爸”，但当她解开带子时，她喊道，神圣的圣丹尼斯，他浑身湿透了，把半条毯子翻过来放在下面。他。当然，他的婴儿陛下对这种厕所仪式是最难处理的，他让所有人都知道了这一点：

—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.
——哈巴啊啊啊啊啊啊啊。

And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.
两颗又大又大、又大又大的泪水顺着他的脸颊流下来。用“不，不，宝贝，不”来安抚他，告诉他吉吉的事和泡芙在哪里，都是没有用的，但总是机智的西斯把奶瓶的奶嘴塞进了他的嘴里，这个年轻的异教徒很快就安息了。

Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.
格蒂真希望他们能把哭闹的孩子带回家，摆脱这一切，不要让她心烦意乱，没有时间出去，还有双胞胎的小孩子。她凝视着远处的大海。这就像人们过去用彩色粉笔在人行道上画的画，可惜把它们留在那里，被全部抹掉，傍晚和云彩出来，贝利灯照在霍斯，听着音乐就像那样，他们在教堂里燃烧的香的香气就像一股飘逸的气息。当她凝视着的时候，她的心开始跳动。是的，他看着的就是她，而且他的眼神里充满了意义。他的目光灼灼地注视着她，仿佛要彻底地审视她，读懂她的灵魂。他们的眼睛很漂亮，富有表现力，但你能相信他们吗？人们太奇怪了。从他的黑眼睛和苍白知识分子的脸上，她立刻就看出他是个外国人，她有一张日场偶像马丁·哈维的照片，只是因为她更喜欢小胡子，因为她不像温妮那样上台。里平汉姆希望他们两个在看戏时总是穿同样的衣服，但她从他坐的地方看不出他是鹰钩鼻还是略微后凸的鼻子。她看得出来，他正沉浸在深深的悲痛之中，他的脸上写满了难以忘怀的悲伤。她愿意付出很多努力才能知道那是什么。他如此专心、如此安静地抬起头，看到她踢球，如果她像那样若有所思地把脚趾朝下地摆动鞋子，也许他能看到她鞋子上明亮的钢扣。她很高兴有人告诉她穿上透明丝袜，以为雷吉·怀利可能会出去，但那是遥远的事情。这就是她经常梦想的事情。 重要的是他，她脸上洋溢着喜悦，因为她想要他，因为她本能地感觉到他与众不同。女孩的心都向着他，她的梦想丈夫，因为她立刻就知道那就是他。如果他受了罪，甚至是他自己就是一个罪人、一个恶人，她也不在乎。即使他是新教徒或卫理公会教徒，如果他真的爱她，她也可以轻松地改变他的信仰。有些伤口需要用心灵药膏来治愈。她是一个有女人味的女人，不像他所认识的其他轻浮的女孩，没有女人味，那些骑自行车的人炫耀他们没有得到的东西，她只是渴望了解一切，原谅一切，如果她能让他爱上她，让他忘记过去的记忆。然后也许他会像一个真正的男人一样温柔地拥抱她，将她柔软的身体压向他，并爱她，他自己的女孩，只为她自己。

Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. Ora pro nobis. Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.
罪人的避难所。受苦者的安慰。奥拉亲诺比斯。据说，凡是怀着信心和坚定不移地向她祈祷的人都永远不会迷失或被抛弃：她也恰如其分地成为受苦者的避难所，因为她内心深处有七种悲伤。格蒂可以想象教堂里的整个场景，彩色玻璃窗亮起来，蜡烛，鲜花和圣母联谊会的蓝色横幅，康罗伊神父正在祭坛上帮助卡农·奥汉隆，用手提箱搬进搬出东西。他的目光垂下。他看起来几乎是一个圣人，他的忏悔室是如此安静、干净、黑暗，他的手就像白蜡，如果她成为穿着白色服装的多米尼加修女，也许他可能会来圣多米尼克修道院参加九日敬礼。他告诉她，当她在忏悔中告诉他这件事时，她的脸涨得通红，生怕他看到，不要担心，因为那只是自然的声音，我们都受到自然法则的约束，他他说，在今生，这不是罪，因为那是来自上帝所设立的女人本性，而我们的圣母亲自对大天使加百列说，愿这事按照你的话语成就在我身上。他是如此善良和神圣，她常常想，她可以为他制作一个带有刺绣花卉图案的褶皱茶室作为礼物或时钟，但她注意到壁炉架上有一个时钟，白色和金色，上面有一只金丝雀鸟。她走出一间小房子，告诉她那天去那儿的时间是关于鲜花，进行了四十个小时的崇拜，因为很难知道该送什么样的礼物，或者也许是一本包含都柏林或其他地方的明亮景色的相册。

The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.
令人恼火的双胞胎小鬼又开始争吵，Jacky把球扔向大海，他们都追着球跑。小猴子像沟水一样常见。应该有人把他们带走，给他们一个很好的藏身之处，让他们俩都呆在自己的地方。西西和伊迪喊叫着让他们回来，因为他们担心潮水会淹没他们并被淹死。

—Jacky! Tommy!
——杰基！汤米！

Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.
不是他们！他们的想法多么棒啊！所以西西说这是她最后一次带它们出去。她跳起来叫他们，然后跑下斜坡，从他身边经过，把头发抛在身后，如果头发再多一点的话，颜色已经足够好了，但她总是在头发上摩擦那么多东西，她却无法得到它。长得长是因为这不自然，所以她只能去向它扔帽子。她迈着大步跑，令人惊奇的是她没有撕开太紧的裙子一侧，因为西西·卡弗里身上有很多假小子的气质，每当她认为自己有能力时，她就是一个前锋。这是一个展示自己的好机会，仅仅因为她是一名优秀的跑步者，她就这样跑步，这样他就可以看到她跑动的衬裙末端和她尽可能向上的瘦小腿。如果她为了让自己看起来很高而踩着高弯的法式高跟鞋，故意不小心被什么东西绊倒，然后摔了一跤，那就对了。画面！对于这样一位绅士来说，目睹这将是一次非常迷人的暴露。

Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer gosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.
天使女王，族长女王，先知女王，所有圣徒，他们祈祷，最神圣的念珠女王，然后康罗伊神父将香炉交给佳能奥汉隆，他放入香炉，焚圣圣礼和西西卡弗里抓住了这两个双胞胎，她很想在他们的耳朵上狠狠地夹一下，但她没有这么做，因为她认为他可能会在旁边看着，但她一生中从未犯过更大的错误，因为格蒂不用看就能看到他卡农·奥汉隆 (Canon O'Hanlon) 的目光始终没有离开过她，然后卡农·奥汉隆 (Canon O'Hanlon) 将锡炉递回给康罗伊神父，跪下，抬头看着圣体圣事，唱诗班开始唱《坦图姆尔戈》(Tantum ergo)，她只是及时将脚进进出出。音乐随着“坦图默·戈萨·克拉门”的节奏起起伏伏。三点和十一点，她周二在乔治街的斯帕罗店付了钱，不是复活节前的星期一，而且袜子上没有支架，这就是他看到的，透明的，而不是她那些微不足道的袜子。既不是形状也不是形状（她的脸颊！），因为他脑子里有眼睛可以亲眼看到其中的差异。

Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.
西西带着两个双胞胎和他们的球沿着河岸走来，跑完后她的帽子无论如何都戴在了她的一侧，她确实看起来像个流浪者，拖着两个孩子，穿着她两周前才买的单薄衬衫，就像一块抹布一样。她的背影和裙子像漫画一样悬挂着。格蒂只是暂时摘下帽子，整理了一下头发，女孩的肩膀上从来没有见过一头更漂亮、更精致的棕色头发——这是一种容光焕发的小景象，温柔得令人心旷神怡，几乎令人发狂。你得走了很多英里才能找到一头这样的头发。她几乎可以看到他眼中闪过的钦佩之光迅速回应，这让她的每一根神经都感到刺痛。她戴上帽子，这样她就可以从帽檐下面看到，当她看到他眼中的表情时，她加快了呼吸，呼吸困难。他看着她，就像蛇看着猎物一样。她女人的本能告诉她，她已经在他体内激起了恶魔，一想到这里，一股燃烧的猩红就从喉咙蔓延到额头，直到她脸上可爱的颜色变成了一朵灿烂的玫瑰。

Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:
伊迪·博德曼也注意到了这一点，因为她眯着眼睛看着格蒂，半微笑着，她的眼镜就像一个老处女，假装给婴儿喂奶。她是个易怒的小昆虫，而且永远都是，这就是为什么没有人可以和她一起去干涉与她无关的事情。她对格蒂说：

—A penny for your thoughts.
——一分钱代表你的想法。

—What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I was only wondering was it late.
-什么？格蒂回答道，露出洁白的牙齿，笑容更加灿烂。我只是想知道是不是晚了。

Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.
因为她真希望他们能把这对流鼻涕的双胞胎和他们的婴儿带回家，让他们免遭恶作剧，所以她只是温柔地暗示已经迟到了。当西西过来时，伊迪问她时间，西西小姐，不管你喜欢什么油嘴滑舌的，说已经是接吻时间过半了，是时候再接吻了。但伊迪想知道，因为他们被告知要早点到。

—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum.
——等等，西西说，我去问问那边的彼得叔叔，他的难题现在几点了。

So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.
于是她走了过去，当他看到她过来时，她可以看到他把手从口袋里拿出来，变得紧张起来，开始摆弄他的表链，抬头看着教堂。尽管格蒂生性热情，但他可以看出他对自己有很强的控制力。前一刻他还在那里，被一种让他凝视的可爱所迷住，下一刻却是那位安静、严肃的绅士，他高贵的身材的每一处线条都表现出自制力。

Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.
西西说要原谅她，他介意告诉她什么是正确的时间吗？格蒂可以看到他拿出手表，听着手表，抬起头，清了清喉咙，他说他很抱歉手表停了，但他想一定是八点以后了，因为太阳已经落山了。他的声音带着一种有教养的韵律，尽管他说话的口音很谨慎，但柔和的语调中却让人怀疑他在颤抖。西西说了声谢谢，然后伸出舌头回来说叔叔说他的自来水厂坏了。

Then they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.
然后他们唱了《Tantum ergo》的第二节，卡农·奥汉隆再次站起来，焚了圣礼，跪下，他告诉康罗伊神父，其中一支蜡烛正要点燃鲜花，康罗伊神父站了起来一切都解决了，她可以看到那位绅士正在给他的手表上发条，听着作品，她及时地更加进出地摆动腿。天色越来越暗，但他看得见，而且他一直在看着他正在给手表上发条或者正在对它做什么，然后他把它放回去，把手放回口袋里。她感到一种感觉涌遍全身，通过头皮的感觉和对她留下的刺激，她知道那件事一定要发生了，因为上次也是她因为月亮而剪头发的时候。他的黑眸再次注视着她，注视着她的每一个轮廓，简直就是在崇拜她的神殿。如果说一个男人的热情目光中曾有过毫不掩饰的钦佩的话，那么在这个男人的脸上就显而易见了。这是给你的，格特鲁德·麦克道威尔，你知道的。

Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.
伊迪开始准备出发，她的时间到了，格蒂注意到她给出的那个小暗示达到了预期的效果，因为沿着海岸线到推手推车和西西的地方还有很长的路要走。摘下双胞胎的帽子，整理一下头发，当然是为了让自己更有吸引力，卡农·奥汉隆站起来，外套伸到脖子上，康罗伊神父递给他卡片让他宣读，他宣读了“Panem de coelo praestitisti eis”。伊迪和西西一直在谈论这件事，问她，但格蒂可以用自己的钱偿还他们，当伊迪问她是否因为她最好的男孩把她扔下而感到心碎时，她只是以严厉的礼貌回答。格蒂猛地皱起眉头。她的眼眸中闪过一抹冰冷的光芒，其中蕴含着不可估量的蔑视。这很痛——哦，是的，很深，因为伊迪有她自己安静的方式说这样的话，她知道这些话会像她那只令人困惑的小猫一样受伤。格蒂的嘴唇迅速张开，准备说出这个词，但她强忍住了喉咙里的抽泣，她的身材如此纤细、如此完美、如此美丽，似乎是一位艺术家梦寐以求的。她比他想象的更爱他。像他所有的性别一样，他是个无忧无虑的骗子和善变的人，他永远不会明白他对她意味着什么，一瞬间，蓝色的眼睛里涌出一阵刺痛的泪水。他们的目光无情地审视着她，但她勇敢地努力回报以同情，她向他们看了一眼她的新征服者。

—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.
——哦，格蒂回答道，快如闪电，大笑起来，骄傲的脑袋一闪而过。我可以向我喜欢的人致敬，因为今年是闰年。

Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.
她的话语听起来十分清晰，比斑鸠的咕咕声更具音乐性，但它们冰冷地打破了沉默。从她年轻的声音中就可以看出，她不是一个可以轻易惹事的人。至于雷吉先生，他的炫耀和他的一点钱，她可以把他扔到一边，就好像他是个肮脏的东西一样，她再也不会对他有哪怕一丁点的想法，把他的愚蠢的明信片撕成十几块。如果以后他敢假设她会用一种有节制的轻蔑的眼神看着他，那会让他当场枯萎。娇小的小伊迪小姐的脸色没有丝​​毫下降，格蒂从她那黑如雷霆的脸色看出，她只是处于一种巨大的愤怒之中，尽管她隐藏了它，小金纳特，因为那根箭已经击中了她小小的嫉妒心，他们两人都知道她是一个冷漠的、孤立的、在另一个领域的人，她不属于他们，也永远不会属于他们，而且还有其他人知道这一点并看到它，这样他们就可以把它放进烟斗里抽烟。

Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.
伊迪扶起小博德曼准备出发，西西把球、黑桃和水桶塞进去，时间也到了，因为沙人正在前往小博德曼大师的路上。西西还告诉他，比利眨眼就要来了，宝宝要出去了，宝宝看起来太鸭子了，从他高兴的眼睛里笑出来，西西就这样用他那肥嘟嘟的肚子和宝宝开玩笑地戳他，没有拜托，他向所有人表达了他的致意，并在他全新的运球号码布上留言。

—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.
——天啊！普德尼馅饼！西斯抗议道。他的围兜被毁了。

The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.
这些轻微的意外引起了她的注意，但她很快就把这件小事解决了。

Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.
格蒂压抑着一声惊呼，紧张地咳嗽了一声，伊迪问什么，她只是想告诉她在它飞翔的时候抓住它，但她的举止一向像淑女，所以她只是以完美的机智假装说：这是祝福，因为就在那时，钟声从宁静海岸的尖塔上响起，因为卡农·奥汉隆站在祭坛上，康罗伊神父将面纱披在肩上，手里拿着圣体进行祝福。

How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel Vaughan and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art thou real, my ideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if—what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.
暮色渐浓，艾琳的最后一眼，那些动人的晚钟声，与此同时，一只蝙蝠从长满常春藤的钟楼飞过黄昏，从这里飞到那里，带着微弱的迷失的叫声，这是多么令人感动的场景。她可以看到远处灯塔的灯光，如此美丽，她会喜欢用一盒颜料来做，因为这比做一个男人更容易，很快点灯人就会巡视长老会教堂的场地，沿着路过阴凉的特里顿维尔大街，情侣们在那里散步，点燃窗边的灯，雷吉·怀利经常在那里转动他的飞轮，就像她在康明斯小姐所著的《点灯人》一书中读到的那样，康明斯小姐是梅布尔·沃恩和其他故事的作者。因为格蒂有着无人知晓的梦想。她喜欢读诗，当她从伯莎·苏普尔那里得到那张可爱的告白专辑的纪念品时，她用珊瑚粉色的封面写下了她的想法，她把它放在梳妆台的抽屉里，尽管它不失奢华，非常整洁干净。在那里，她保存了她少女时代的宝藏：玳瑁梳子、她的玛丽之子徽章、白玫瑰香味、眉毛、她的雪花石膏蓬盒和丝带，当她的东西洗完回家时，可以更换，上面写着一些美丽的想法里面的紫罗兰墨水是她在达姆街的赫利买的，因为她觉得如果她能像那首深深吸引她的诗一样表达自己，她也可以写诗，这首诗如此吸引她，以至于她从一天晚上找到的报纸上抄下来野菜。我的理想，你是真实的吗？它被路易斯·J·沃尔什（Louis J Walsh）称为“马赫拉费尔特”（Magherafelt），在出现了有关暮光的事情之后，你愿意吗？ 有时，诗歌之美，在其转瞬即逝的可爱中如此悲伤，让她的眼睛蒙上无声的泪水，因为她觉得岁月对她来说，正在一点一点地流逝，但为了这个缺点，她知道她不需要害怕任何竞争。那是从达尔基山下来时发生的一场事故，而她总是试图隐瞒这一点。但她觉得这一切必须结束。如果她看到他眼中的魔力诱惑，她就会毫无保留。爱嘲笑锁匠。她将做出巨大的牺牲。她的一切努力都是为了分享他的想法。她对他来说比整个世界还要珍贵，让他的日子充满幸福。有一个最重要的问题，她很想知道他是一个已婚男人，还是一个失去妻子的鳏夫，还是像歌之国的外国名字贵族那样的悲剧，不得不把她关进疯人院，只是残酷友善。但即使——然后呢？这会带来很大的不同吗？她高贵的天性本能地回避一切不雅的事情。她讨厌那种人，那些从菟丝子旁边的住宿人行道上倒下的女人，那些跟士兵和粗鲁男人一起走的，不尊重女孩的荣誉，侮辱性别，然后被带到警察局。不，不：不是那样。尽管社会上有大人物的惯例，他们只是像哥哥姐姐一样的好朋友，没有其他一切。也许这是他从记不清的日子里一直在哀悼的旧情人。她以为她明白了。她会尝试理解他，因为男人是如此不同。旧爱在等待，等待着，伸出洁白的小手，蓝色迷人的眼睛。我的心！ 她会追随她的爱情梦想，她内心的指令告诉她，他就是她的一切，全世界唯一一个对她来说爱情的男人就是导师。其他的都不重要了。无论发生什么，她都会是狂野的、不受约束的、自由的。

Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:
卡农·奥汉隆将圣体放回圣体圣堂，跪下，唱诗班唱起《万民之主》，然后他锁上了圣体堂的门，因为祝福已经结束，康罗伊神父递给他帽子，让他戴上，伊迪问道。她来了，但杰基·卡弗里喊道：

—O, look, Cissy!
——噢，看，西西！

And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
他们都看着那是片状闪电，但汤米也在教堂旁边的树林上看到了它，蓝色，然后是绿色和紫色。

—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.
——这是烟花，西西·卡弗里说。

And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.
他们全都跑下海滩，匆匆忙忙地查看房屋和教堂，伊迪推着婴儿车，车里坐着婴儿博德曼，西西拉着汤米和杰基的手，以免他们逃跑。

—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.
——来吧，格蒂，西西喊道。这是集市烟花。

But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.
但格蒂态度坚决。她无意听从他们的指挥。如果他们能像玫瑰一样奔跑，她就可以坐下来，这样她就可以从她所在的地方看到。那双眼睛紧紧地盯着她，让她的脉搏刺痛。她看了他一会儿，与他的目光相遇，一道光芒照在她身上。那张脸上洋溢着白热化的激情，激情如坟墓般沉默，它让她成为了他的。最后只剩下他们一人，没有其他人来打探和议论，她知道他可以至死不渝地信任，坚定，一个纯正的人，一个牢牢掌握着荣誉的人。他的手和脸在动，她浑身颤抖。她远远地向后靠去，仰望烟花所在，双手抱住膝盖，以免向后仰望，当她露出那双优美的美腿时，没有人看到只有他和她。 ，柔软而精致的圆润，她似乎听到了他的心跳，他嘶哑的呼吸，因为她也知道这样的男人的激情，热血，因为伯莎·苏普尔曾经秘密地告诉过她，并让她发誓她我从来没有听说过拥挤地​​区委员会的一位绅士房客，他用报纸剪下了那些裙子舞者和高踢腿者的照片，她说他过去常做一些你有时在床上可以想象的不太好的事情。但这与类似的事情完全不同，因为这一切都是不同的，因为她几乎可以感觉到他将她的脸贴向他的，以及他英俊的嘴唇的第一次快速的热接触。 此外，只要你在结婚前没有做其他事情，就可以得到赦免，而且应该有女牧师，不用你说出来就能理解，西西·卡弗里有时也有那种梦幻般的眼神，所以她亲爱的，温妮·里平厄姆也对演员的照片如此着迷，除此之外，还因为它发生的另一件事。

And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!
杰基·卡弗里大喊着看，还有另一个，她向后靠去，吊袜带是蓝色的，因为是透明的，所以他们都看到了，他们都大喊着看，看，就在那里，她向后靠了这么远看到烟花，有一个奇怪的东西在空中飞舞，一个柔软的东西，来来回回，黑暗。她看到一根长长的罗马蜡烛在树上升起，升起，升起，在紧张的寂静中，随着它越来越高，他们都激动得喘不过气来，她不得不越来越向后靠去仰望它。 ，高，高，几乎看不见，她的脸充满了一种神圣的，因向后紧张而迷人的红晕，他还可以看到她的其他东西，nainsook内裤，抚摸皮肤的面料，比其他的衬裙更好，绿色的，四岁和十一岁，因为是白色的，她让他看到，她看到了他看到了，然后它升得很高，一瞬间就看不见了，她的四肢都在颤抖，因为她向后弯得太远了，以至于他看到了。在她膝盖以上的高处可以看到全景，那里没有人甚至没有秋千或涉水，她并不感到羞耻，他也不会以那种不谦虚的方式看着，因为他无法抗拒看到奇妙的揭露一半像那些裙子舞者在绅士们面前表现得如此不谦虚，而他一直在看，看。她真想哽咽地向他哭泣，伸出雪白纤细的手臂，让他过来，感受他的嘴唇贴在她白皙的额头上，这是一个年轻女孩的爱的哭声，是从她身上挤出来的一点窒息的哭声，那哭声是已经响彻千古。然后一枚火箭弹射了出来，砰地一声，一片空白，哦！然后罗马蜡烛爆裂了，就像一声叹息！大家都喊道“噢！”哦！ 欣喜若狂，它从里面涌出一股金色的发丝雨，它们脱落了，啊！它们都是绿色的、带着露珠的星星，带着金色的光芒坠落，啊，多么可爱，啊，柔软，甜蜜，柔软！

Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.
然后一切都如露水般地融化在灰色的空气中：一切都寂静无声。啊!她迅速向前倾身，瞥了他一眼，可怜兮兮的小眼神，带着可怜的抗议，带着害羞的责备，他的脸色像个女孩，他靠在后面的岩石上。利奥波德·布鲁姆（因为他就是他）静静地站着，低着头看着那双年轻而纯真的眼睛。他是多么的野蛮啊！又来了？一个美丽纯洁的灵魂向他呼唤，而他是个可怜人，他是如何回答的呢？他真是个彻头彻尾的流氓！所有人中的他！但那双眼睛里却充满了无限的怜悯，即使他犯了错误、犯了罪、迷失了方向，对他来说也有一句宽恕的话。女孩应该告诉吗？不，一千次不。那是他们的秘密，只有他们自己，独自在隐秘的暮色中，没有人知道或告诉别人，除了那只小蝙蝠，它在夜晚如此轻柔地飞来飞去，小蝙蝠不会告诉。

Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:
西西·卡弗里吹着口哨，模仿足球场上的男孩们，展示她是一个多么伟大的人：然后她哭了起来：

—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.
——格蒂！格蒂！本来打算。快点。我们可以从更远的地方看到。

Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.
格蒂想到了一个主意，这是爱情的小诡计之一。她把手伸进头巾口袋，掏出棉絮，挥手回应，当然没有让他这么做，然后又把它放了回去。想知道他是否太远了。她站了起来。是再见吗？不。她必须走，但他们会在那里再次见面，直到那时，明天，她都会梦见昨天晚上的梦。她挺直了身子。他们的灵魂在最后的缠绵一瞥中相遇，那双直达心底的眼睛充满异样的光芒，痴迷地挂在她如花般甜美的脸上。她对他微弱地笑了笑，那是一种甜蜜、宽容的微笑，一种近乎泪水的微笑，然后他们就分开了。

Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was …
慢慢地，她头也不回地沿着参差不齐的绳子走向西西，走向伊迪，走向杰基和汤米·卡弗里，走向小博德曼。现在天色更暗了，海岸上有石头和木头，还有滑溜溜的海藻。她走路时带着她特有的安静尊严，但很小心，而且非常缓慢，因为——因为格蒂·麦克道威尔……

Tight boots? No. She’s lame! O!
紧身靴？不，她是瘸子！哦！

Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something in the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. Reserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O. Pity they can’t see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy’s hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside her deshabillé. Excites them also when they’re. I’m all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn’t in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I’ll write to you. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. Tableau! O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each other’s appearance. You’re looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t lend each other a pinch of salt.
布卢姆先生看着她一瘸一拐地走开。可怜的姑娘！这就是为什么她被搁置在架子上而其他人则进行了冲刺。看到她的前臂被割断，我以为出了什么问题。被抛弃的美丽。女性的缺陷要严重十倍。但让他们很有礼貌。很高兴她表演时我不知道。热辣的小恶魔都一样。我不介意。像修女、黑人或戴眼镜的女孩一样好奇。那个斜视的很精致。我想，靠近她的月刊，会让他们感到痒痒的。我今天头疼得很厉害。我把信放在哪儿了？嗯，好。各种疯狂的渴望。舔便士。修女告诉我，在宁静修道院里的女孩喜欢闻岩油的味道。我想处女最终都会发疯。姐姐？今天都柏林有多少女性患有这种疾病？玛莎，她。空气中有些东西。那是月亮。但我的意思是，为什么不是所有女性都在同一个月亮的同一时间来月经呢？我想取决于他们出生的时间。或者一切都从头开始，然后就失去了步调。有时莫莉和米莉在一起。不管怎样，我已经充分利用了这一点。该死的，我很高兴今天早上我没有因为她那封愚蠢的“我会惩罚你”的信而在浴室里这么做。今天早上补偿了那个电车司机。那个奸诈的麦考伊阻止我说什么。和他的妻子订婚在乡下提包，声音像镐。感谢小怜悯。也便宜。供您询问。因为他们自己也想要。他们自然的渴望。每天晚上都有一大群人从办公室里涌出来。预留更好。不想要它，他们就把它扔给你。活捉他们吧，O。可惜他们看不到自己。一个充满软管的梦想。那是哪里？是啊。卡佩尔街的 Mutscope 图片：仅限男性。偷窥狂。威利的帽子以及女孩们用它做了什么。他们给那些女孩拍照还是都是假的？内衣做到了。 感受她的 deshabillé 内部的曲线。当他们在的时候也会让他们兴奋。我很干净，来吧，弄脏我。他们喜欢在牺牲时互相打扮。米莉对莫莉的新衬衫很满意。首先。将它们全部穿上，然后将它们全部脱下。莫莉。为什么我给她买了紫罗兰吊袜带。我们也是：他打的领带，他可爱的袜子和翻起的裤子。我们第一次见面的那天晚上，他戴着绑腿。他可爱的衬衫在他的什么下面闪闪发光？喷气机。假设一个女人每拔掉一根别针就会失去魅力。钉在一起。哦，梅里丢了她的别针。为了某人而盛装打扮。时尚是他们魅力的一部分。只有当你走上秘密的轨道时才会改变。除了东方：玛丽，玛莎：现在和那时一样。没有拒绝合理的报价。她也不着急。当他们有的时候，总是去找一个伙伴。他们永远不会忘记约会。可能不符合规格。他们相信机会，因为就像他们自己一样。其他人则倾向于对她进行奇怪的挖苦。学校里的女朋友们，互相搂住对方的脖子，或者十根手指紧扣在一起，在修道院花园里接吻，低声谈论一些无关紧要的秘密。修女们的脸被粉刷成白色，头巾很酷，她们的念珠上下摆动，对她们得不到的东西也怀有报复心理。铁丝网。现在确定并写信给我。我会写信给你。现在你不会吗？莫莉和乔西·鲍威尔。直到Mr Right出现，然后千载难逢。画面！噢，看看这是谁！看在上帝的份上！你怎么样？你自己都做了什么？亲吻并很高兴亲吻见到你。互相挑刺对方的外表。你看起来棒极了。姐妹的灵魂。互相露出牙齿。你还剩多少？不会互相借一撮盐。

Ah!
啊!

Devils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance. Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn’t let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he’s another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?
当这一切临到他们身上时，他们就是魔鬼。外表阴暗恶魔般。莫莉经常告诉我感觉事情有千吨重。抓破我的脚底板。噢，这样！哦，那真是太精致了！我自己也感受一下。偶尔休息一下也不错。想知道那时和他们一起去是不是很糟糕。一方面是安全的。转动牛奶，使琴弦折断。我在花园里读到一些关于枯萎植物的内容。此外，他们还说，如果她戴的花枯萎了，她就是一个调情者。全部是。 Daresay 她的感受 1. 当你有这样的感觉时，你常常会遇到你所感受到的。喜欢我还是什么？他们看的着装。永远了解求爱对象：衣领和袖口。好吧，公鸡和狮子也会做同样的事情，雄鹿也会这样做。同时可能更喜欢解开领带之类的。裤子？假设我当时呢？不，轻轻地做。不喜欢粗暴和翻滚。在黑暗中亲吻，永不诉说。在我身上看到了一些东西。想知道什么。早点拥有我这个样子，就比某个诗人小伙子更早了，他的头发涂满了熊脂，右眼镜上戴着爱情锁。助君子文学。应该注意我的外表我的年龄。没有让她看到我的侧面。不过，你永远不知道。漂亮的女孩和丑陋的男人结婚。美女和野兽。此外，如果莫莉的话我就不能这样。摘下帽子，露出头发。宽帽檐。买来遮脸，遇到可能认识的人，弯下腰或者捧一束花去闻闻。头发强韧。当我们在霍尔斯街的岩石上时，我为莫莉梳头买了十鲍勃。为什么不？假设他给了她钱。为什么不？都是偏见。她值十英镑、十五英镑、甚至更多，一英镑。什么？我想是这样。这一切都是徒劳的。大胆的手：马里恩夫人。我是否忘记在那封信上写上地址，就像我寄给弗林的明信片一样？那天我没有系领带去德里米家。和莫莉吵架让我厌烦了。不，我记得。 里奇·古尔丁：他是另一个。压在他的心头。有趣的是我的手表停在四点半了。灰尘。他们用鲨鱼肝油来清洁。我自己就可以做。节省。那是他，她的时候吗？

O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.
哦，他做到了。进入她体内。她做过。完毕。

Ah!
啊!

Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren’t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That’s the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn’t have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you’re stuck. Gain time. But then you’re in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It’s so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn’t called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That’s what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap’s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don’t think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it’s not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.
布卢姆先生小心翼翼地将湿衬衫重新整理好。主啊，那个跛行的小恶魔。开始感到寒冷和湿冷。后遗症不愉快。但你仍然必须以某种方式摆脱它。他们不在乎。也许受到了称赞。回家吃美味的面包和牛奶，和孩子们一起做晚祷。好吧，不是吗？看看她，因为她毁了一切。必须有舞台布景、胭脂、服装、位置、音乐。名字也。女演员的恋情。内尔·格温、布雷斯格窦夫人、莫德·布兰斯科姆。窗帘拉起来。月光银辉。少女被发现怀着沉思的心情。小甜心过来亲我一下。尽管如此，我还是觉得。它赋予男人力量。这就是它的秘密。干得好，我从迪格纳姆酒吧出来，在墙后面下了车。就是苹果酒。否则我不可能有。让你想唱歌。 Lacaus esant taratara。假设我和她说话。关于什么？然而，如果你不知道如何结束谈话，那就糟糕了。问他们一个问题，他们就会问你另一个问题。如果你被困住了，这是个好主意。赢得时间。但那时你就在购物车里了。当然，如果你说：晚上好，然后你看到她就在说：晚上好，那就太好了。啊，但是那个漆黑的夜晚，我差点就以亚壁古式的方式跟克林奇太太说话了，我以为她就是这样。哇！那天晚上米斯街的女孩。所有那些脏话都是我让她说的。当然都是错的。她称之为我的方舟。很难找到一个这样的人。啊嗬！如果你在他们提出要求时不回答，对他们来说一定很可怕，直到他们变得坚强。当我给她额外的两先令时，她吻了我的手。鹦鹉。按下按钮，小鸟就会发出吱吱声。希望她没有叫我先生。哦，她的嘴在黑暗中！而你是一个已婚男人，带着一个单身女孩！这就是他们所享受的。从另一个女人身上夺走一个男人。或者甚至听说过。与我不同。 很高兴摆脱其他人的妻子。吃着他的冷盘。今天伯顿的小伙子吐出了嚼过的软骨。法文信还在我的钱包里。一半麻烦的原因。但有时可能会发生，我不认为。进来吧，一切都准备好了。我梦到。什么？最坏的情况开始了。当场地不符合他们的喜好时，他们如何改变场地。问你喜欢蘑菇吗，因为她曾经认识一位绅士。或者问你当某人改变主意并停下来时他会说什么。然而，如果我全力以赴，就说：我想要，类似这样的事情。因为我做到了。她也是。得罪她了。然后补起来。假装非常想要某样东西，然后为了她而哭泣。讨好他们。她一定一直在想着别人。有什么害处？一定是她既然来了，就用理智，他，他，他。初吻就起到了作用。吉祥时刻。他们内心的某些东西突然流行起来。糊状的，通过他们的眼睛，偷偷地看出来。第一个想法是最好的。记住这一点，直到他们去世的那一天。莫莉，穆尔维中尉，在花园旁边的摩尔墙下亲吻了她。她告诉我十五岁。但她的胸部很发达。然后就睡着了。格伦克里晚餐后，我们开车回家。羽毛山。睡觉时咬牙切齿。市长大人也看上了她。瓦尔·狄龙.中风了。

There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother’s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.
她和他们一起去那里看烟花。我的烟花。上升如火箭，下降如棍子。还有孩子们，他们肯定是双胞胎，正在等待事情发生。想成为大人。穿着妈妈的衣服。时间充裕，了解人情世故。还有那个长着拖把头和黑鬼嘴的深色的。我知道她会吹口哨。嘴巴就是为此而生的。就像莫莉一样。为什么贾梅家的那个高级妓女只把面纱戴到鼻子上。请您告诉我正确的时间好吗？我会告诉你走黑暗小巷的正确时间。每天早上说梅子和棱镜四十遍，治愈嘴唇肥胖。还抚摸着小男孩。旁观者看到了比赛的大部分内容。当然，他们了解鸟类、动物、婴儿。在他们的行列中。

Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn’t give that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyes she had, clear. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what’s not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don’t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.
当她沿着海滩走下去时，她没有回头。不会给人那种满足感。那些女孩，那些女孩，那些可爱的海边女孩。她的眼睛很漂亮，清澈。是眼白带来的，而不是瞳孔。她知道我的事吗？课程。就像一只猫坐在狗的跳跃之外。女人从来没有遇到过像威尔金斯那样的人，他在高中时画了一张维纳斯的照片，并展示了他所有的物品。这叫无辜？可怜的白痴！他的妻子有自己的工作要做。永远不要看到他们坐在标有“油漆未干”的长凳上。眼睛都盯着他们。看看床底下有没有什么东西。渴望获得一生的恐惧。它们像针一样锋利。当我对莫莉说卡夫街拐角处的那个男人很帅，我想她可能会喜欢时，我立即扭动了一下他有一只假手臂。也曾有过。他们从哪里得到的？打字员一次爬两级罗杰·格林的楼梯来表达她的理解。我的意思是，从父亲传给母亲，传给女儿。骨子里孕育的。例如，米莉将手帕放在镜子上擦干，以节省熨烫的时间。广告在镜子上吸引女性眼球的最佳位置。当我派她去普雷斯科特那儿买莫莉的佩斯利披肩时，我必须把她的袜子里的零钱带回家！聪明的小妖精。我从来没有告诉过她。她搬运包裹的方式也很整齐。吸引男人，就是这样的小事。举起她的手，摇晃着，让血红的时候回流。你是跟谁学的？没有人。护士教我的一些东西。哦，他们难道不知道吗！就在我们离开西伦巴第街之前，她三岁了，站在莫莉的梳妆台前。我的节奏很好。穆林加尔。谁知道？世间之道。年轻的学生。无论如何，直接在她的别针上，不像其他人。但她仍然很活跃。主啊，我湿了。 你真是魔鬼。她的小腿肿胀起来。透明的丝袜，拉伸到了断裂点。不像今天那个邋遢的人。 A.E. 皱巴巴的丝袜。或者格拉夫顿街的那个。白色的。哇！牛肉到脚后跟。

A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.
一枚猴子拼图火箭爆炸了，发出噼啪声。兹拉德和兹拉德，兹拉德，兹拉德。西西、汤米和杰基跑出去看看，伊迪推着手推车跟在后面，然后格蒂跑到了岩石的拐弯处。她会吗？手表！手表！看！环顾。她闻到了洋葱的味道。亲爱的，我看到了，你的。我都看到了。

Lord!
主！

Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s. For this relief much thanks. In Hamlet, that is. Lord! It was all things combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He’s right. Might have made a worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldn’t be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.
还是对我有好处。继基尔南（Kiernan）、迪格纳姆（Dignam）之后颜色变差。非常感谢这种缓解。在《哈姆雷特》中，就是这样。主！这是所有事情的结合。激动。当她向后靠去时，我感到舌头根部疼痛。你的头只是在旋转。他是对的。然而，我可能会犯下更严重的错误。而不是无话可说。然后我就告诉你一切。但这仍然是我们之间的一种语言。不可能吧？不，他们叫她格蒂。可能是假名，但是就像我的名字和地址一样，海豚的谷仓是百叶窗。

Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
她的娘家姓是杰米娜·布朗

And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.
她和母亲住在爱尔兰镇。

Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram’s horn. Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harm’s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam. Children’s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women’s fault also. That’s where Molly can knock spots off them. It’s the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn’t know what to call her. Always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife. Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.
我想这个地方让我想到了这一点。所有人都用同一把刷子涂柏油，擦袜子里的钢笔。但球滚向她，仿佛它明白了。每一颗子弹都有它的坯料。当然，我永远不会把任何东西直接扔到学校。像公羊角一样弯曲。然而可悲的是，因为这种情况只持续了几年，他们就开始安定下来，当他们抱着孩子做“啊啊”时，爸爸的裤子很快就会适合威利和富勒的婴儿土。没有软的工作。拯救他们。让他们远离伤害。自然。洗孩子，洗尸体。迪格南。孩子们的手总是围绕着他们。椰子头骨，猴子，一开始甚至没有闭合，襁褓中的酸牛奶和受污染的凝乳。不应该给那个孩子一个空奶头来吸吮。用风充满它。博福伊夫人，普尔福伊。必须打电话去医院。奇怪卡兰护士还在那儿。莫莉在咖啡宫的某些夜晚，她常常去看看。我注意到那位年轻的奥黑尔医生正在帮他刷外套。布林夫人和迪格纳姆夫人也曾经喜欢这样，适合结婚。最糟糕的是晚上，杜根夫人在城市武器店告诉我。丈夫喝醉了，浑身散发着酒吧的臭味，像只鸡貂一样。在黑暗中将其吸进鼻子里，闻到一股陈腐的牛油味。然后早上问：我昨晚喝醉了吗？然而糟糕的政策要责怪丈夫。小鸡回家栖息。他们像胶水一样粘在一起。也许也是女人的错。这就是莫莉可以打败他们的地方。这是南方的血液。摩尔人的。还有形式、图形。双手感受着富裕。只是比较一下其他人。妻子被锁在家里，骷髅在柜子里。请允许我介绍一下我的。然后他们就会把你介绍给一个不起眼的人，不知道该怎么称呼她。总是能看到一个人妻子的弱点。 仍然有命运在里面，坠入爱河。他们之间也有各自的秘密。如果没有哪个女人把他们拉在手上，这些家伙就会走向灭亡。然后是女孩们的小纸条，一先令高，有小丈夫。当上帝创造它们时，他使它们匹配。有时孩子们表现得足够好。两次都不算一。或者七十岁的老富翁和脸红的新娘。五月结婚，十二月悔改。这种湿漉漉的感觉非常不舒服。卡住。嗯，包皮没有回来。最好分开。

Ow!
噢！

Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once. Cat’s away, the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time, well that’s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it’s all arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.
另一只手是一个六英尺高的人，他的手表口袋里有一个妻子。长与短皆有之。大他和小她。我的手表很奇怪。手表总是会出问题。想知道这个人之间是否有任何磁力影响，因为那是他的时间。是的，我想，立刻。猫走了，老鼠就会玩耍。我记得在药丸巷看过。现在还有磁力。一切背后都有磁性。例如地球拉动它并被拉动。这会引起运动。还有时间，那就是运动所需的时间。然后，如果一件事停止了，整个 ghesabo 就会一点一点停止。因为一切都已经安排好了。磁针告诉你太阳、星星正在发生什么。小块钢铁。当你伸出叉子时。来。来。提示。女人和男人就是这样。叉子和钢。莫莉，他。打扮一下，看看，提出建议，让你看到，看到更多，如果你是一个男人，看到这一点，就会反抗你，就像打喷嚏一样，腿，看看，看看，如果你有胆量的话。提示。必须放飞。

Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear. But lots of them can’t kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.
想知道她在那个地区感觉如何。耻辱都放在第三者面前。更多的是因为她的袜子破了一个洞。莫莉，她的下颌突出，头向后仰，围绕着马术表演中穿着马靴和马刺的农民。当画家们在西伦巴第街时。那家伙的声音很好听。朱利尼是如何开始的。闻一下我做的。像花一样。也是如此。紫罗兰。可能来自油漆中的松节油。一切都为自己所用。与此同时，她的拖鞋在地板上刮擦，这样他们就听不到了。但我认为，他们中的很多人都无法踢横梁。保持这个状态几个小时。有点像将军在我周围，半在我的背上。

Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That’s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow. What is it? Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She’d like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there’s some connection. For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way. We’re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.
等待。嗯。嗯。是的。那是她的香水。为什么她挥手。我把这个留给你，让你在我远在枕头上的时候想起我。它是什么？鸡血石？不，风信子？嗯。玫瑰，我想。她想要那种香味。又甜又便宜：很快就酸了。为什么莫莉喜欢抗药膏。很适合她，还夹杂着一点茉莉花的味道。她的高音和低音。在舞会之夜，她遇见了他，那是舞蹈的时光。热量把它带出来了。她穿着黑色的衣服，身上还带着之前的香水味。好导体，是吗？还是不好？光也。假设有某种联系。例如，如果你进入一个黑暗的地窖。也是很神秘的事情。为什么我现在才闻到味道？像她一样，慢慢地、但坚定地到来。假设有数以百万计的微小颗粒被吹过。是的。因为那些香料岛屿，今天早上，辛伽罗人在几英里之外闻到了它们的味道。告诉你它是什么。它就像一层细密的面纱或网，覆盖在他们的皮肤上，细如你所谓的游丝，而他们总是从它们身上纺出细细的面纱或网，细如任何东西，就像彩虹的颜色而不自知。紧贴她脱下的所有东西。她的丝袜鞋面。保暖鞋。停留。抽屉：轻轻一踢，把它们取下来。再见，下次再见。猫还喜欢在床上嗅她的衬衣。千里了解她的气味。洗澡水也。让我想起草莓和奶油。想知道它到底在哪里。那里或者腋窝或者脖子下面。因为你可以把它从所有的洞和角落里拿出来。风信子香水是用乙醚油什么的制成的。麝香鼠。袋子在他们的尾巴下面。一粒倒臭味数年。狗在后面互相攻击。晚上好。晚上。你怎么闻？嗯。嗯。很好，谢谢。动物都是这样。是的，现在这样看。我们是一样的。 例如，有些女性在经期时会警告您不要这样做。走近一点。然后买一个可以挂帽子的 Hogo。像什么？盆栽鲱鱼变质或。嘘！请不要践踏草坪。

Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And it’s extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.
也许他们从我们身上闻到了男人的味道。但又怎样呢？前几天约翰的办公桌上放着长长的雪茄手套。呼吸？你吃什么、喝什么就能做到这一点。不，我是说曼斯梅尔。必须与此相关，因为应该是不同的牧师。女人们围着它嗡嗡作响，就像苍蝇绕着糖蜜一样。用栏杆隔开祭坛，不惜一切代价登上它。禁忌祭司之树。噢，父亲，你愿意吗？让我成为第一个。它会扩散到全身，渗透到全身。生命之源。而且这种气味非常好奇。芹菜酱。让我。

Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that’s the soap.
布卢姆先生把鼻子伸了进去。嗯。进入。嗯。打开他的背心。杏仁或。不，是柠檬。啊不，那是肥皂。

O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention Meagher’s just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he’ll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.
噢，顺便说一下那个乳液。我知道我心里有事。再也没有回去过，肥皂也没有付钱。不喜欢像今天早上那个老太婆那样拿着瓶子。海因斯可能付给我那三先令。我可以提一下 Meagher's 只是为了提醒他。如果他继续写那段话的话。两点和九点。他会对我有不好的看法。明天打电话。我欠你多少？三和九？两点和九点，先生。啊。可能会阻止他再次给予信任。这样就会失去你的客户。酒吧确实如此。研究员们在石板上记下一笔账单，然后绕过后街溜到其他地方。

Here’s this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don’t mock what matter? That’s the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty’s joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.
这是这位贵族之前经过的地方。从海湾吹来的。刚刚走完就回头了。晚餐时间总是在家。看起来很破烂：吃得很饱。现在享受大自然。饭后恩典。晚饭后步行一英里。当然，他在某处有少量银行余额，政府坐镇。现在跟在他后面走让他很尴尬，就像今天那些报童一样。不过你还是学到了一些东西。像别人看待我们一样看待我们自己。只要女人不嘲笑又有什么关系呢？这就是找出答案的方法。问问自己现在他是谁。 《海滩上的神秘人》是利奥波德·布鲁姆先生的精彩花絮故事。按每列一几尼的费率付款。那个家伙今天在墓边穿着棕色的麦金塔电脑。然而，他的天命上有鸡眼。健康也许吸收了一切。他们说，哨子带来雨。一定是某个地方。奥蒙德湿气中的盐。身体感受到了气氛。老贝蒂的关节在架子上。希普顿修女的预言是关于周围的船只在眨眼之间飞行。不，有下雨的迹象。皇家读者。远处的山峦似乎正在逼近。

Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against. Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star I see. Venus? Can’t tell yet. Two. When three it’s night. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land, goodnight.
霍斯。贝利光。二、四、六、八、九。看。必须改变，否则他们可能会认为这是一所房子。清障车。格蕾丝·亲爱的。人们害怕黑暗。还有萤火虫、骑自行车的人：点亮时间。珠宝钻石闪烁效果更好。女性。光是一种让人安心的东西。不会伤害你。现在当然比很久以前好多了。乡村道路。让你无缘无故地穿过小肠子。还有两种类型是你所反对的。皱眉或微笑。赦免！一点也不。晒后在阴凉处喷洒植物的最佳时间。还有一些光。红色光线最长。罗伊格比夫·万斯教给我们：红、橙、黄、绿、蓝、靛、紫。我看到的一颗星星。金星？还不能说。二。三点钟的时候，已经是晚上了。那些夜云一直在那儿吗？看起来像一艘幽灵船。不，等等。是树吗？一种视错觉。海市蜃楼。夕阳之地此。太阳在东南方落下。我的祖国，晚安。

Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don’t know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it’s the only time we cross legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it’s the evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns. History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.
露珠落下。亲爱的，坐在那块石头上对你不好。带来白色的流动。从来没有小宝宝，更不用说他是大而坚强的人了。我自己可能也会长痔疮。像夏天感冒一样粘连，口腔疼痛。最糟糕的是用草或纸切割。位置的摩擦力。喜欢成为她坐的那块石头。噢，可爱的小宝贝，你不知道自己看起来有多漂亮。我在那个年纪就开始喜欢他们了。青苹果。抓住所有这些优惠。假设这是我们唯一一次盘腿坐着。今天还有图书馆：那些女毕业生。他们下面有快乐的椅子。但这是晚上的影响。他们感受到了这一切。像花朵一样开放，知道它们的时间，向日葵，菊芋，舞厅里，枝形吊灯，灯下的大道。在马特·狄龙的花园里，我亲吻了她的肩膀。希望那时我能有一幅她的全身油画。六月也是我所追求的。年又回来了。历史总是重演。是的，峭壁和山峰，我再次与你在一起。生活、爱情、在你自己的小世界里航行。现在？当然为她的跛脚感到难过，但必须保持警惕，不要感到太多怜悯。他们利用了优势。

All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that’s all. Lovers: yum yum.
霍斯现在一片寂静。远处的山峦似乎。我们在哪里。杜鹃花。也许我是个傻瓜。他得到李子，我得到李子。我进来的地方。那座老山所见的一切。名字变了：仅此而已。恋人：嗯嗯。

Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin’s Barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s house. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you’re escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.
我现在感觉很累。我会起床吗？哦等等。耗尽了我所有的男子气概，小坏蛋。她吻了我。再也不。我的青春。只有来一次。或者她的。明天坐火车去那里。不，返回不一样。就像孩子一样，你第二次拜访房子。我想要的新的。阳光下并无新鲜事。照顾 P. O. Dolphin 的谷仓。你不开心吗？顽皮的亲爱的。在卢克·道尔家里的海豚谷仓里猜谜语。马特·狄龙和他的一群女儿：蒂尼、阿蒂、弗洛伊、麦米、路易、海蒂。莫莉也是。是八十七。比我们早一年。还有老少校，偏爱他的精神。奇怪的是她是独生子，我也是独生子。所以它返回了。以为自己正在逃避，结果却遇见了自己。最长的路就是回家的最短路。而就在他和她的时候。马戏团的马在环中行走。我们玩过瑞普·范·温克尔。撕裂：亨尼·道尔的大衣撕裂。面包车：送面包的车。 Winkle：鸟蛤和长春花。然后我又做了瑞普·凡·温克尔的回归。她靠在餐边柜上看着。摩尔人的眼睛。在断头谷沉睡了二十年。一切都变了。忘记了。年轻人都老了。他的枪被露水生锈了。

Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I’m a tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there’s the light in the priest’s house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They’re a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That’s how that wise man what’s his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can’t be tourists’ matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory’s not so bad.
巴。这是在飞什么？吞？可能是蝙蝠。以为我是一棵树，所以盲目。鸟没有气味吗？轮回。他们相信你可以因悲伤而变成一棵树。垂柳。巴。他就到了。有趣的小乞丐。想知道他住在哪里。钟楼就在那里。很可能。他的脚后跟悬在神圣的气味中。我想贝尔把他吓坏了。弥撒似乎结束了。可以听到他们所有人的声音。为我们祷告。并为我们祈祷。并为我们祈祷。重复的好主意。广告也是如此。从我们这里购买。并从我们这里购买。是的，牧师家里有灯。他们的饭菜很节俭。还记得我在汤姆公司时的估价错误吗？是二十八了。他们有两栋房子。加布里埃尔·康罗伊的兄弟是牧师。巴。再次。想知道为什么他们晚上像老鼠一样出来。他们是一个混血品种。鸟就像跳跃的老鼠。什么让他们害怕，光还是噪音？最好还是坐着不动。所有的本能都像干旱中的小鸟一样，通过扔小石子从罐子里取水。就像一个穿着斗篷的小个子，他有一双小手。细小的骨头。几乎看到它们闪闪发光，有点蓝白色。颜色取决于您看到的光线。例如，像老鹰一样凝视太阳，然后观察鞋子，看到黄色的斑点。想要在所有东西上打上自己的商标。例如，今天早上楼梯上的那只猫。棕色草坪的颜色。假设你从未见过它们具有三种颜色。不对。 City Arms 的半虎斑白色玳瑁纹，额头上刻着 em 字母。身体有五十种不同的颜色。霍斯不久前的紫水晶。玻璃闪烁。那位智者就是这样用燃烧的玻璃来称呼他的名字的。然后石南花着火了。这不可能是游客的比赛。什么？也许这些树枝在风和光下干摩擦在一起。 或者金雀花中的碎瓶子在阳光下就像燃烧的玻璃。阿基米德。我有！我的记忆力还不错。

Ba. Who knows what they’re always flying for. Insects? That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. Faugh a Ballagh! Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it’s round. Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor’s weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on his door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?
巴。谁知道他们总是为了什么而飞行。昆虫？上周那只蜜蜂进入了房间，在天花板上玩着它的影子。可能是那个咬我的，回来看看。鸟也。永远不会发现。或者他们怎么说。就像我们的闲聊一样。她说，他说。他们必须有勇气飞越海洋并返回。许多人必须在暴风雨和电报线中丧生。水手们也有可怕的生活。巨大的远洋轮船在黑暗中挣扎，像海牛一样低鸣。发个巴拉格！从此，该死的诅咒你！其他人则乘坐手帕帆般的船只，在暴风雨袭来时，像守灵时的鼻烟一样左右摇摆。也结婚了。有时会在地球尽头的某个地方离开数年。确实没有尽头，因为它是圆的。他们说的每个港口都有妻子。如果她介意的话，她会找到一份好工作，直到约翰尼再次踏上回家的路。如果他真的这么做了。闻波特酒的尾味。他们怎么会喜欢大海呢？但他们确实这么做了。锚已经称重了。他带着肩胛骨或一枚奖章起航，以求好运。出色地。可怜的爸爸的父亲把这个tephilim放在门上可以触摸，不知道这是什么。这把我们从埃及地带入为奴之家。所有这些迷信中都有一些东西，因为当你出去时永远不知道有什么危险。抓住木板或跨在横梁上过着严酷的生活，救生带围着他，大口喝着盐水，这是他最后的一口，直到鲨鱼抓住他。鱼会晕船吗？

Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.
然后你就会看到美丽的平静，万里无云，风平浪静，船员和货物都碎成碎片，戴维·琼斯的储物柜，月亮俯视着如此平静。不是我的错，老鹦鹉。

A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race! and from the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.
最后一根孤独的蜡烛从米鲁斯集市上飘向天空，为默瑟的医院寻找资金，最后一根蜡烛破裂了，垂了下来，洒下一簇紫罗兰色的星星，但只有一颗白色的星星。它们漂浮、坠落：它们消失了。牧羊人的时刻：折叠的时刻：幽会的时刻。九点钟的邮递员挨家挨户地敲响了两声受欢迎的敲门声，腰带上的萤火虫灯透过月桂树篱到处闪烁。五棵小树中，一根高举的棉绒点燃了莱希露台上的灯。在亮着灯的窗纱旁，在平等的花园旁，一个尖锐的声音在哭喊：《电讯晚报》，停止新闻版！金杯赛结果出炉！一个男孩从迪格纳姆家门口跑出来喊道。蝙蝠叽叽喳喳地飞到这里，飞到那里。远处的沙滩上，灰色的海浪缓缓袭来。霍斯厌倦了漫长的白天，在美味的杜鹃花丛中睡去（他已经老了），他高兴地感到夜风徐徐，吹乱了他那片蕨类植物。他躺着，睁着一只红眼睛，没有睡着，深沉而缓慢地呼吸，睡着了却醒着。远在基什河岸上，停泊的灯船闪烁着，向布鲁姆先生眨了眨眼。

Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin’s King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don’t know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn’t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I’ll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. O’Hara’s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. Buenas noches, señorita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.
那里的那些家伙一定有生活，被困在同一个地方。爱尔兰灯板。为他们的罪孽忏悔。海岸警卫队也有。火箭和马裤浮标和救生艇。那天，我们乘坐艾琳之王号出去巡游，把一袋旧文件扔给他们。动物园里的熊。肮脏的旅行。醉汉出去搅动他们的肝脏。吐到船上去喂鲱鱼。恶心。而女人们，脸上都带着对上帝的敬畏。米莉，没有任何惊慌的迹象。她的蓝色围巾松了，笑着。在那个年纪不知道死亡是什么。然后他们的胃就干净了。但他们害怕迷路。当我们躲在克拉姆林的树后面时。我不想。妈妈！妈妈！树林里的宝贝们。还用面具吓唬他们。将它们抛向空中以接住它们。我会杀了你。乐趣只有一半吗？或者孩子们在打仗。整个人很认真。人们怎么能用枪互相瞄准呢？有时他们会消失。可怜的孩子们！只会困扰野火和荨麻疹。甘汞净化 我为此得到了她。和莫莉睡得更好之后。她的牙齿和她一模一样。他们喜欢什么？另一个自己？但第二天早上，她就撑着伞追赶她。也许是为了不受伤。我摸了摸她的脉搏。滴答作响。以前的手很小，现在却很大了。最亲爱的帕普利。当你触摸时，手所说的一切。喜欢数我的背心纽扣。我记得她第一次入住。看得我笑死了。首先是小家伙。我认为左一更敏感。我也是。离心近一点？如果肥胖流行的话，就用垫子垫起来吧。她的生长痛在晚上呼唤着我，吵醒了我。当她的本性第一次出现时，她感到害怕。可怜的孩子！对于母亲来说也是奇怪的时刻。让她找回了少女时代。直布罗陀。从布埃纳维斯塔看去。奥哈拉塔。海鸟在尖叫。老巴巴里猿吞噬了他所有的家人。 日落时分，枪声响起，士兵们越过防线。她看着大海告诉我。傍晚时分，天气晴朗，万里无云。我一直以为我会嫁给一位领主或一位拥有私人游艇的富有绅士。 Buenas noches，小姐。 El hombre ama la muchhacha hermosa。为什么是我？因为你与其他人相比太陌生了。

Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for Leah, Lily of Killarney. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see. Hope she’s over. Long day I’ve had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan’s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam’s put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we’re going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer’s that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow’s mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O’Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti’s gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes’s. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. What’s that? Might be money.
最好别像帽贝一样整夜待在这里。这种天气使人变得迟钝。等红灯时肯定已经九点了。回家。对于莉亚来说太晚了，基拉尼的莉莉。不，可能还没睡。打电话去医院看看。希望她已经结束了。我度过了漫长的一天。玛莎、沐浴、葬礼、凯斯之家、女神博物馆、德达勒斯之歌。然后是巴尼·基尔南店里的那个大喊大叫的人。那里有我自己的。醉酒的人咆哮着我所说的关于他的上帝的话让他皱起了眉头。反击的错误。或者？不，应该回家嘲笑自己。总是想在公司里​​畅饮。像两岁的孩子一样害怕独自一人。假设他打我。换个角度看。那么还不错。也许他的意思不是为了伤害。为以色列欢呼三声。为他兜售的嫂子欢呼三声，她嘴里叼着三颗尖牙。一样的美感风格。特别适合喝杯茶的老聚会。婆罗洲野人的妻子的妹妹刚刚来到城里。想象一下，在清晨近距离。正如莫里斯亲吻牛时所说，每个人都符合他的口味。但迪格南（Dignam）却穿上了靴子。哀悼之家如此令人沮丧，因为你永远不知道。无论如何，她想要钱。必须按照我的承诺去拜访那些苏格兰寡妇。陌生的名字。我们理所当然地会先离开。周一那个寡妇就是在克莱默家外面看着我的。埋葬了可怜的丈夫，但保费进展顺利。她的寡妇的小钱。出色地？你期望她做什么？一定要哄她走。我讨厌看到鳏夫。看起来好凄凉啊可怜的奥康纳的妻子和五个孩子在这里被贻贝毒死。污水。绝望。某个戴着圆顶帽子的好主妇来照顾他。拖着他，板着脸，围着大围裙。 女式灰色绒布灯笼裤，三先令一双，非常便宜。他们说，平淡而被爱，永远被爱。丑陋：没有女人认为自己丑陋。爱，撒谎，为了明天我们死去而变得英俊。有时会看到他四处走动，试图找出是谁玩弄的。 U.p：向上。命运就是如此。他，不是我。还有一家商店经常被注意到。诅咒似乎缠着它。昨晚做梦了吗？等待。有些困惑。她穿着红色拖鞋。土耳其。穿着马裤。假设她这样做呢？我喜欢她穿睡衣吗？该死的很难回答。南内蒂走了。邮船。现在就在霍利黑德附近。必须钉住凯斯的广告。工作海因斯和克劳福德。给莫莉的衬裙。她有东西要放进去。那是什么？可能是钱。

Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can’t read. Better go. Better. I’m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What’s this? Bit of stick.
布卢姆先生弯下腰，翻阅了纸条上的一张纸。他把它拿到眼前，凝视着。信？不，无法阅读。最好走吧。更好的。我累得不想动了。旧习字簿的一页。所有这些洞和鹅卵石。谁能数得清？永远不知道你发现了什么。瓶子里有一个从沉船中扔出的宝藏的故事。包裹邮寄。孩子们总是想把东西扔进海里。相信？面包撒在水面上。这是什么？一点棍子。

O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do. Will I?
哦！那个女人有我累坏了。现在不那么年轻了。她明天会来这里吗？在某个地方永远等她。必须回来。凶手就是这么做的。我会吗？

Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?
布卢姆先生用手杖轻轻拨动脚下厚厚的沙子。给她写一条信息。可能会留下来。什么？

I

Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don’t know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.
早上有一些扁平足踩在上面。无用。冲走。潮水来了。看到她脚边有一个水池。弯下腰，看着我的脸，黑暗的镜子，对着它呼吸，搅拌。所有这些岩石都带有线条、疤痕和字母。哦，那些透明的！况且他们也不知道。那个另一个世界的意义是什么。我叫你顽皮的孩子，因为我不喜欢。

AM. A.
是。 A。

No room. Let it go.
没地儿。放手吧。

Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except Guinness’s barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.
布卢姆先生用他缓慢的靴子擦掉了这些字母。沙子是无望的东西。里面什么也长不出来。一切都消逝了。不用担心大船到这里来。除了吉尼斯的驳船。八十天绕过基什岛。按设计完成了一半。

He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t. Chance. We’ll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so young.
他把木笔扔掉。棍子掉进淤泥里，卡住了。现在，如果你想连续一周这样做，你就做不到。机会。我们再也不会见面了。但这很可爱。再见，亲爱的。谢谢。让我感觉自己很年轻。

Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.. Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won’t go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment. Won’t sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm in him. Just a few.
如果我有的话，现在就小睡一下。应该快九点了。利物浦的船早已不见了……连烟都没有了。而她可以做另一件事。也做了。还有贝尔法斯特。我不会去。跑到那里，跑回恩尼斯。让他。闭上眼睛一会儿。不过，不会睡觉。半梦半梦。它永远不会一样。再次击球。对他没有任何伤害。一些。

O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon señorita young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.

A bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just for a few
一只蝙蝠飞了。这里。那里。这里。灰色的远处传来钟声。布卢姆先生张开嘴，左脚靴子斜向一边磨着，倾身呼吸。只为了几个

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipotent nature’s incorrupted benefaction. For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?
普遍认为，对于那些具有智慧的凡人所认为的最有益的事情，这个人的敏锐度被认为是非常缺乏洞察力的，而这些凡人对那些最博学的学说一无所知，当然是因为他们内心值得高尚的装饰。当人们普遍同意，在其他条件相同的情况下，没有任何外在辉煌是一个国家的繁荣，这比衡量其前进的程度更有效地体现了对邪恶不断蔓延的关注的敬意。如果它幸运地存在而缺席，那么原始的东西就构成了无所不能的自然的纯洁恩惠的特定标志。 对于谁在那里，谁已经理解了某种重要的东西，但意识到那外部的辉煌可能是一个向下趋势的淫荡现实的表面，或者相反，任何人都没有受到启发，以至于没有意识到，因为没有任何自然的恩惠可以与恩惠相抗衡。因此，每一个最公正的公民都应该成为他的同类的劝告者和警告者，并担心过去由国家出色地开始的事情在未来可能不会取得类似的卓越成就，如果一种不正当的习惯逐渐养成的话祖先们诽谤了可敬的人，将习俗传到了那个深刻的地方，那个人过于大胆，有勇气崛起，申明，对任何人来说，没有比无意识地忽视同时传达命令和承诺的福音更令人憎恶的冒犯了。凡人有丰富的预言，还是有减少的威胁，崇高反复的生育功能，是否曾不可撤销地受到命令？

It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that all hardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.
因此，我们不会怀疑，正如最优秀的历史学家所说，在凯尔特人中，医学艺术是否会受到高度尊重，因为凯尔特人的本质是令人钦佩的。更不用说旅馆、麻疯病院、发汗室、瘟疫坟墓了，他们最伟大的医生，奥希尔家族、奥希基家族、奥李家族，都孜孜不倦地制定了各种方法，使病人和旧病复发的人重新获得健康，无论是这种疾病是颤抖的枯萎或松散的博伊康奈尔流。当然，在每一项公共工程中，如果其中包含任何重大的准备工作，那么它们的重要性就应该是相称的，因此他们采用了一项计划（无论是通过预先考虑还是随着经验的成熟，很难说后续询问者的不同意见会影响到计划的实施）。到目前为止，还没有达到一致地表现出来），因此，生育远远没有消除所有意外可能性，因此在女性最艰难的时刻，无论病人主要需要什么护理，不仅是为了富裕的人，而且是为了那些没有足够的钱的人他们几乎没有钱，甚至常常几乎没有钱，无法勇敢地生存，而且所提供的报酬微乎其微。

To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!
对她来说，从那时起，从那时起，无论如何，没有什么能够对她造成骚扰，因为除了繁衍母亲的繁荣之外，所有公民的主要感受根本不可能是这样，因为他们已经接受了永恒的神凡人世代，以适应她的看法，当情况如此时自己在车里分娩，彼此之间怀着巨大的渴望，这促使她被接纳到那个住处。噢，审慎的民族的事情不仅在被人看到，而且甚至在相关方面都值得称赞，他们期待着去见母亲，她感到她突然即将被珍惜已经开始了！

Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.
宝贝在出生之前就有过幸福。在子宫内赢得了他的崇拜。无论在那种情况下，所做的事情都是轻松完成的。助产士在沙发上提供健康的食物、宁静的环境、最干净的襁褓，就好像分娩现在已经完成，并由明智的远见所设定：但这同样需要与她的病例相关的药物和手术工具，不遗漏所有方面我们的地球球体在不同纬度上呈现出令人分心的景象，并提供了神圣和人类的图像，女性对这些图像的思考是有利于肿胀的，或缓解了母亲在阳光灿烂、建造良好的美丽家园中的问题，而表面上，它已经远去并具有繁殖能力，她来到那里躺着，她的任期结束了。

Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night’s oncoming. Of Israel’s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.
夜幕降临时，有一个人站在门边。以色列人就是那个在地球上漂泊了很远的人。人的使命是赤裸裸地独自一人带到那所房子。

Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God’s angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.
A.霍恩是那所房子的领主。七十张床让他住在那里，挤满了母亲，她们习惯躺在床上生下健康的婴儿，上帝的天使对玛丽说道。守望者在那里行走，病房里的白人姐妹彻夜难眠。他们仍然聪明，疾病舒缓：十二个月三百次。他们是最真实的床边人，因为霍恩拥有最警惕的病房。

In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland’s westward welkin. Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne’s house.
在病房里，守望者听到那个男人温和的声音带着太古的声音站了起来，向他敞开了她的大门。瞧，莱文一眨眼的功夫就照亮了爱尔兰向西的威尔金。她满心希望毁灭者上帝会因为他的罪恶而放弃水。基督的十字架使她站在胸骨上，而他则表示他宁愿在她的茅草下居住。那个对她来说有价值的男人走进了霍恩的房子。

Loth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.
霍恩的礼帽里拿着寻觅者，他不愿意感到厌烦。在她的储藏室里，他与亲爱的妻子和可爱的女儿住在一起，而她们在陆地和海底上已经漂泊了九年了。当她进城参加聚会时，他就没有向她鞠躬。现在他渴望原谅她，让她允许他那张敏捷的脸，她的，当时看起来如此年轻。光芒迅速点燃了她的双眼，绽放出他赢得话语的红晕。

As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O’Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.
当她的目光落在他的杂草上时，她害怕悲伤。很高兴她在阿雷德之前就成为了那个人。他问她奥黑尔医生的消息是否从遥远的海岸传来，她带着优雅的叹息回答说，奥黑尔医生在天堂。听到他如此残忍无情地说出这句话，这个人感到很难过。她在那里告诉他的一切，毁掉了如此年轻的朋友的死亡，阿尔加特不愿意放弃上帝的正确智慧。她说，由于上帝的仁慈，他有一个相当甜蜜的死亡，有弥撒牧师为他干尸，圣堂和病人的油涂抹在他的四肢上。男子当时很认真地问修女，死者是死于哪种死亡，修女回答说，他是在三年前的奇尔德玛斯到来时死于莫纳岛的肚蟹，她向真主祈祷，让他亲爱的灵魂安息在世上。他的不朽。他听到她悲伤的话语，戴着帽子悲伤地凝视着。他们俩就这样站了一会儿，满怀希望地彼此悲伤。

Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.
因此，每个人，请注意最后的结局，那就是你的死亡，以及附着在每个由女人所生的男人身上的灰尘，因为当他赤身裸体地从母亲的子宫里出来时，他最终将赤身裸体地离开他，因为他将离开他。来了。

The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.
进屋的男人随后对护士说话，问她产床上的那个女人过得怎么样。护士回答他，说那个女人已经痛了三天了，生孩子会很辛苦，无法忍受，但再过一会儿就可以了。她说她见过很多女人生孩子，但从来没有像那个女人的生孩子那样困难。然后她把这一切都告诉了他，因为她知道那个男人就住在那所房子附近。男人听了她的话，因为他感受到了神奇女人们在为人母的辛苦中所遭受的痛苦，他想看看她的脸，这张脸对任何男人来说都是一张美丽的脸，但她在做了多年的女仆后就被抛弃了。九十二血流斥责她无儿无女。

And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.
当他们说话的时候，城堡的门被打开了，周围传来一阵微弱的噪音，就像许多坐在那儿吃肉的人一样。就在他们面前站着一位年轻的学问骑士狄克逊。旅行者利奥波德对他很友好，据说他们在这位学识渊博的骑士躺着的悲惨之家里发生了争执，因为旅行者利奥波德胸部被长矛刺伤，来到那里接受治疗。一条可怕的龙袭击了他，为此他用挥发性的盐和圣油制作了尽可能多的药膏。他现在说他应该去那座城堡和那里的人们一起快乐。旅行者利奥波德说他应该去别的地方，因为他是一个谨慎而狡猾的人。这位女士也是他的代理人，并责备了这位学习骑士，尽管她很好地抱怨说，旅行者所说的话对于他的狡猾来说是错误的。但这位学习骑士不听拒绝，也不肯让他做任何与他的清单相反的事，他说这是一座奇妙的城堡。旅行者利奥波德在不同的土地和有时的环境中进行了多次行军后，由于四肢酸痛，他进入城堡休息。

And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.
城堡里放置了一块芬兰桦木制成的木板，由该国的四个矮人支撑着，但他们不敢再因为施魔法而多动。这块木板上有可怕的剑和刀，是在一个巨大的洞穴中由闪烁着白色火焰的恶魔制成的，然后将它们固定在水牛和雄鹿的角上，那里的水牛和鹿的角数量惊人。还有一些船只是由马哈德的魔法从海洋和空气中由术士用他的呼吸制成的，他将呼吸像气泡一样喷入其中。董事会上充满了公平的欢呼和丰富的气氛，没有人能设计出更丰富的内容。还有一桶银子，被人用手工移动打开，里面躺着奇怪的无头鱼，尽管人们不相信这是可能的事情，但他们没有看到它，但事实确实如此。这些鱼躺在从葡萄牙土地带来的油腻的水中，因为其中的脂肪就像橄榄榨汁一样。在那座城堡里，看到他们如何用魔法用迦勒底肥沃的小麦肾制成堆肥，在他们放入的某些愤怒的灵魂的帮助下，堆肥像一座巨大的山一样奇妙地膨胀起来，这真是一个奇迹。他们教那里的蛇将自己缠绕在地上的长棍上，并用这些蛇的鳞片酿造出类似蜂蜜酒的啤酒。

And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.
学识渊博的骑士让利奥波德公子倒了一杯酒，然后停下来，而在场的所有人都喝了。利奥波德公子为了取悦他，把他的海狸打扮得漂漂亮亮的，因为他从来没有喝过任何蜂蜜酒，然后他把蜂蜜酒放在一边，私下里，他把更多的部分倒在了邻居的玻璃杯里，而他的邻居也没有喝到这一点。诡计。他和他们一起在城堡里坐下来休息一会儿。感谢全能神。

This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.
与此同时，这位好姐妹站在门口，恳求他们在我们的主耶稣的尊敬下停止航行，因为上面有一个怀孕的婴儿，一位温柔的女士，她的时间很快。利奥波德爵士听到楼上高处传来哭声，他想知道这是什么哭声，是孩子的还是女人的，我很惊讶，他说，这不是现在就来的。我觉得它的持续时间太长了。他很警惕，看到一位富兰克林把莱纳汉放在那一边的桌子上，这张桌子比其他任何人都古老，因为他们都是同一企业中的有德行的骑士，而且因为他年长，所以他对他温柔地说话。 。但是，他说，否则她将在上帝的恩赐下出生并享受她的孩子的快乐，因为她已经等待了很长时间。喝醉的富兰克林说：“期待每一个时刻都是她的下一个时刻。”他还拿起摆在他面前的杯子，因为他不需要任何人要求或希望他喝，“现在喝吧，”他说，非常愉快，他为了他们俩的健康而喝了一大口，因为他是一个过眼云烟的好人。他的欲望的人。利奥波德爵士是学者大厅里有史以来最善良的客人，是最温顺的男人，也是最仁慈的男人，也是有史以来最善良的男人，也是世界上最真诚的骑士，曾为温柔的女士提供奴仆服务。在杯中向他郑重地许诺。女人的悲哀与惊奇的思考。

Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.
现在让我们谈谈那种为了醉酒而存在的团契。董事会的两边都有一些学者，也就是说，迪克森和他的同事林奇和马登都是医学学者，还有一位来自阿尔巴隆加的富兰克林和一位来自阿尔巴隆加的克罗瑟斯。 ” ，年轻的斯蒂芬，有一种兄弟般的风度，是董事会的负责人，而科斯特洛，人们很早就对他进行了拳打脚踢，不久就掌握了他（在所有这些人中，保守的年轻斯蒂芬，他是最醉的一个，要求还有更多的蜂蜜酒），旁边是温顺的利奥波德爵士。但在年轻的玛拉基身上，他们等待着他答应来，并无意中说出他如何违背了他的誓言。利奥波德爵士和他们坐在一起，因为他对西蒙爵士和他的儿子小斯蒂芬怀有深厚的友谊，因此，在最长的流浪之后，他的倦怠使他平静下来，因为他们在那段时间以最尊贵的方式招待了他。露丝红了他，爱带着他徘徊，不愿离开。

For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, effectu secuto, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.
因为他们都是聪明机智的学者。他听到他们的世代相传都涉及出身和正义，年轻的马登坚称，在这种情况下，妻子很难死（因为一年前，霍恩家里与一个埃布拉纳女人发生了争执，现在她已经离开了这个世界，在她去世前的第二天晚上，所有的水蛭和药剂师都对她的情况进行了咨询）。他们说她应该活得更远，因为一开始，他们说，这个女人应该在痛苦中分娩，因此，那些有这种想象力的人肯定年轻的马登说的是实话，因为他有良心让她死。其中不少人，其中包括年轻的林奇，都怀疑世界现在正受到邪恶的统治，因为它从来都不是其他的，尽管卑鄙的人不这么认为，但法律和他的法官都没有提供任何补救措施。上帝赐予伸张正义。这话虽然很少说，但所有人都齐声欢呼不，我们的圣母，妻子应该活着，婴儿应该死去。他们的颜色在他们的头上变得很热，无论是争论还是喝酒，但富兰克林·莱纳汉每次都及时给他们倒啤酒，这样至少不会缺乏欢乐。然后年轻的马登展示了整个事件，并说她是如何死的，以及出于神圣宗教的缘故，帕默和贝德斯曼的缘故，以及他向阿布拉坎的圣乌尔坦发的誓，她的好丈夫不会让她死，因此他们是一切奇妙的悲伤。年轻的斯蒂芬对他说：先生们，杂音在民间很常见。现在，婴儿和父母都在荣耀他们的造物主，一个处于阴暗的地狱，另一个处于净化之火中。 但是，天哪，那些我们每晚都无法实现的可能是上帝的灵魂呢？这是对圣灵、上帝、生命之主和生命赐予者的罪孽？因为，先生们，他说，我们的欲望是短暂的。我们是我们体内那些小生物的手段，而大自然除了我们之外还有其他目的。然后，小迪克森对科斯特洛拳打脚踢，希望他能得到什么结果。但他喝得太醉了，他能对他说的最好的话就是，如果他有幸摆脱了色欲的脾脏，他永远不会对一个女人不诚实，不管她是谁，无论是妻子、女仆还是男人。阿尔巴隆加的克罗瑟斯唱着年轻的玛拉基对这只野兽独角兽的赞美，千年以来，他曾一度驾着角而来，而其他人一直用他们的嘲笑来刺伤他，他们用他们的恶意嘲讽，见证了圣福提努斯的所有和几个引擎使他能够做任何人类要做的事情。于是，他们都笑了起来，只有年轻的斯蒂芬和利奥波德爵士，他们从来不敢笑得太公开，因为他有一种奇怪的幽默感，他不会流露出来，也因此他为她感到遗憾，因为她无论是谁，无论身在何处。然后，年轻的斯蒂芬滔滔不绝地谈论着将把他赶出怀抱的母亲教会，谈论着教规的法律，谈论着堕胎的守护神莉莉丝，谈论着光明种子之风或吸血鬼口对口的力量所带来的伟大，或者像维吉利厄斯那样根据阿威罗伊和摩西·迈蒙尼德的观点，由于西方的影响，或者月花的臭味，或者她与她的男人刚刚睡过的女人睡在一起，effectu secuto，或者可能在她的浴室里。 他还说，在第二个月末，人类的灵魂如何被注入，以及如何为了上帝更大的荣耀而在我们所有的神圣母亲中折叠灵魂，而尘世的母亲只是孕育野兽的母亲，应该按照教规死去，因为他这么说。持有渔夫印章的，就是那可称颂的彼得，世世代代的圣教会都建立在这磐石上。他们所有的单身汉都问利奥波德爵士，在类似的情况下，他是否会像冒着生命危险去拯救生命一样危及她的人身安全。出于谨慎的心态，他会回答所有合适的问题，并且，他把手放在下巴上，按照他的习惯，掩饰说，正如他所知道的那样，他曾经像门外汉一样热爱物理艺术，并且也同意他经历了如此罕见的事故，这对母教会来说是件好事，就像一下子就拥有了出生和死亡便士，这样他就逃脱了他们的问题。狄克逊说，这是事实，帕迪，而且，或者我错了，这是一个意味深长的词。年轻的斯蒂芬是一个非常高兴的人，他断言，从穷人那里偷窃的人是借给上帝的，因为他醉酒时表现得很狂野，而且他现在很快就陷入了这种情况。

But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.
但利奥波德爵士言出必行，因为他仍然对妇女在分娩时发出的尖叫声感到怜悯，同时他也想起了他的好夫人玛丽恩，她为他生了一个唯一的男孩，在他活着的第十一天，死了，没有任何一位艺术家能够拯救如此黑暗的命运。她为这件不幸的事感到无比震惊，因为他被安葬在一个用羊毛制成的漂亮胸衣里，这是羊群的花，以免他彻底灭亡，躺在地上（因为当时正值隆冬） ）现在，利奥波德爵士身上没有男孩子作为继承人，他看着他朋友的儿子，为自己失去的幸福而感到悲伤，并为他辜负了一个如此温柔勇敢的儿子而感到悲伤（因为所有人都认为他失败了）他也同样为年轻的斯蒂芬感到悲伤，因为他与那些浪子一起放荡地生活，并与妓女一起谋杀了他的财产。

About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. What means this? Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the postcreation. Omnis caro ad te veniet. No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacre pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder transubstantiality ODER consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.
大约在此时，年轻的斯蒂芬把所有空着的杯子都装满了，所以只剩下很少的莫，如果谨慎的人没有遮蔽他们的脚步，他仍然非常忙碌，他为最高教皇的意图祈祷，他把他们给了他们基督的牧师的誓言，正如他所说，他也是布雷的牧师。现在，我们，他，喝下这杯迷幻酒，畅饮这杯蜂蜜酒，它确实不是我身体的一部分，而是我灵魂的身体。把一小部分面包留给那些只靠面包生活的人。不要害怕任何需要，因为这比其他的沮丧更能带来安慰。在这里见。他向他们展示了闪闪发光的贡币和金匠笔记，他说，他为自己写的一首歌而拥有的价值为两英镑十九先令。他们都很羡慕在以前如此缺钱的情况下能获得上述财富。他的话如下：他说，了解所有人，时间的废墟建造永恒的大厦。这意味着什么？欲望的风吹过荆棘树，但在它从荆棘丛中成长为时间的玫瑰之后。现在标记我。在女人的子宫里，话语就变成了肉体，但在创造者的精神中，所有过去的肉体都变成了不会消失的话语。这就是后期创作。 Omnis caro ad te veniet。毫无疑问，但她的名字是强大的，她探访了我们的阿根买家、治疗者和牧群的亲爱的尸体，我们强大的母亲和最可敬的母亲，伯纳德斯恰当地说，她有一个全能的 deiparae suplicem，也就是说，一个全能的请愿，因为她奥古斯丁也说，是第二个前夕，她赢得了我们，而另一个人，我们的祖母，通过连续的脐带吻合术与我们联系在一起，却以一便士的价格卖掉了我们所有人，包括种子、品种和一代。 但现在的问题是这样的。或者她认识他，我说的那一刻，只是她的创造物的创造物，vergine madre，figlia di tuo figlio，或者她不认识他，然后她对住在那所房子里的彼得·皮斯卡托（Peter Piscator）感到一种否认或无知。杰克和约瑟夫一起建造了所有不幸婚姻的幸福终结的共同赞助人，Parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichueposition c'était le sacre league, ventre de Dieu！ Entweder 超实体性 ODER 同实体性，但决不是实体性。所有人都大声疾呼，说这是一个非常下流的词。他说，怀孕没有喜悦，分娩没有痛苦，身体没有瑕疵，肚子没有大。让淫乱者怀着信心和热情去崇拜吧。我们将凭着意志抵挡住，说。

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch Staboo Stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: The first three months she was not well, Staboo, when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne’s house rest should reign.
于是，拳头科斯特洛用拳头敲击木板，唱起一首下流的歌，内容是关于阿尔马尼一个被关进一个快乐的虚张声势的妓女的妓女的故事，现在他立即攻击了这个女孩：头三个月她身体不太好，斯塔布，当奎格利护士在门口愤怒地对他们说，你们应该羞辱你们时，她也记得他们，她的想法是让一切井然有序地反对安德鲁勋爵来，因为她嫉妒，没有任何美味的骚乱会缩短他们的荣誉。她的守卫。这是一位古老而悲伤的女士，她的表情稳重，走着基督徒的路，习惯上不适合她的脸庞和皱纹的脸，她的劝告也没有影响失禁潘奇科斯特洛是他们中的一员，他们以文明的方式重新夺回了粗鲁的形象。一些人粗鲁无礼，用甜言蜜语来威胁他，另一些人却和他一起合唱，一个穆林抓住了那个傻瓜，他会是多么的魔鬼，你嘎嘎，你微不足道，你陷入了豌豆秸秆，你洛塞尔，你颤抖，你产卵一个叛逆者，你这个堤坝，你这个堕胎者，让他闭嘴，让他醉酒的口水流出来，就像上帝猿猴的诅咒一样，善良的利奥波德先生，他认识到安静的花朵，边缘温柔，也建议时间的场合最神圣的，最值得成为最神圣的。在霍恩的家里，休息应该占主导地位。

To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their Maid’s Tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers: To bed, to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. Orate, fratres, pro memetipso. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper ubi and quomodo. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.
简而言之，这段话是在埃克尔斯的玛丽的迪克森大师微笑着问年轻的斯蒂芬他为什么没有选择接受修道士的誓言的原因时，他回答他在子宫里的服从，在坟墓里的贞洁，但不自觉地回答他他终日贫困。莱尼汉大师此时回来说，他听说了那些邪恶的行为，据他所听，他是如何玷污了一个值得信赖的女性的百合美德，这是对未成年人的腐败，他们也都对此表示了欢迎，并举杯庆祝。他的父权。但他说得非常彻底，这完全与他们的想象相反，因为他是永恒的儿子和永远的处女。他们心中越发欢笑，他们向他演练了他那奇怪的结婚仪式，即配偶脱衣和破花，就像马达加斯加岛上的牧师所用的那样，她穿着白色和藏红花色的衣服，她的新郎穿着白色和谷物的衣服，烧着甘松和蜡烛，在新娘的床上，店员们唱着《凯里》和国歌《Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium》，直到她独自一人在那里。然后他给了他们一个非常令人钦佩的处女膜迷你，由那些精致的诗人约翰·弗莱彻大师和弗朗西斯·博蒙特大师在他们的女仆悲剧中写下，这是为类似缠绕的恋人而写的：上床，上床是玩弄的负担注意力集中在维金纳琴上。精致的甜美上皮丘陵，对青少年的爱情来说最具缓和性，副若虫的芬芳火焰护送他们到夫妻共融的四足台口。狄克逊少爷很高兴地说，他们很高兴，但是，哈基，年轻的先生，最好将他们命名为“博蒙特”和“莱彻”，因为，我实话实说，这样的混合可能会发生很多事情。 年轻的史蒂芬说，他确实对他们有过最美好的回忆，但他们和她之间唯一的一种信仰，就是用炖菜来换取生活的乐趣，在那些日子里，这种信仰非常盛行，这个国家的习俗也认可这一点。他说，没有人比这更伟大的爱，一个男人为了他的朋友而放弃了自己的妻子。你也去照样做吧。因此，或者类似的话，查拉图斯特拉说，他曾是奥克斯泰尔大学的法语文学教授，那里也没有哪个人比人类更受人尊敬。把一个陌生人带进你的塔里会很困难，但你会拥有第二好的床。演说，兄弟们，pro memetipso。众民都要说：阿们。艾琳，请记住，你的世代和你的古老岁月，你是如何对我和我的话语不重视，并把一个陌生人带入我的大门，在我眼前犯下奸淫，并像耶书鲁姆一样变得肥胖和踢球。因此，你违背了我的光明，让我，你的主人，成为仆人的奴隶。归来，归来，米莉氏族：不要忘记我，哦，米利都。你为何在我面前做出这可憎之事，因为你把我当作贾拉普商人而抛弃，并且拒绝我与那些言语阴暗的罗马人和印第安人交往，而你的女儿们却与他们奢侈地睡在一起？现在，我的人民，请放眼望去，在这片被命令的土地上，从何烈山、尼波、毗斯加、哈腾角到一片流着牛奶和金钱的土地。但你却用苦奶哺育了我：你永远熄灭了我的月亮和太阳。你让我永远独自一人在我痛苦的黑暗道路上：你用灰烬之吻吻了我的嘴。 他接着说，这种阴暗的内部环境并没有被七十士译本的智慧所照亮，也没有提到东方从高处停下来，地狱之门降临到了令人恐惧的黑暗中。安慰是轻微的暴行（正如塔利谈到他亲爱的斯多葛学派所说的那样），他的父亲哈姆雷特没有向王子展示燃烧的水泡。生命正午的阿迪亚芬是埃及的瘟疫，在出生前和死后的夜晚是他们最合适的乌比和科莫多。正如所有事物的目的和最终都在某种程度上与它们的起源和起源相一致一样，同样的多重一致性导致了从出生开始的成长，通过一种退行的变形来完成，朝着与自然相适应的最终目标的缩小和消融也是如此。它与我们的太阳下存在。年迈的姐妹们把我们带入了生活：我们哀号、板条、运动、剪断、扣紧、破碎、缩小、死亡：她们在我们身上屈服。首先，从古老的尼罗河水域中拯救出来，在芦苇丛中，一片着迷的荆棘丛中：最后是一座山的空洞，一座隐秘的坟墓，在山猫和ossifrage的欢呼声中。由于没有人知道他的坟墓的普遍性，也不知道我们将被引导到什么过程，也不知道是否以同样的方式去托菲特或伊登维尔，当我们向后看时，我们会从哪个遥远的地区看到我们的身份是什么。他的来历。

Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly Etienne chanson but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.
拳头科斯特洛主要是大声喊出艾蒂安香颂，但他大声吩咐他们，瞧，智慧已经为自己建造了一座房子，这个巨大的、雄伟的、长期建立的拱顶，造物主的水晶宫殿，一切都按照苹果派的顺序，给找到豌豆的人一分钱。

Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack

在杰克约翰露营地的骄傲马戏团中。

A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.
这里的街道上传来一阵黑色的噪音，嘎嘎地、叫喊着回应。托尔在左边大声咆哮：愤怒的投锤者非常可怕。现在，刺痛他心的风暴来了。林奇大师嘱咐他要小心蔑视和肆意妄为，因为上帝的自我因为他的胡言乱语和异教而被激怒了。当初挑战坚强的他变得苍白无力，因为他们可能会一起标记和收缩，而他之前如此高傲的音调现在突然被拉低，当他品尝时，他的心在胸中的笼子里颤抖。那场风暴的谣言然后是一些嘲笑和嘲笑，潘奇·科斯特洛再次重蹈了莱内汉大师发誓他会这样做的耶鲁课，而他确实只是一句话和对任何最轻微的颜色的打击。但吹牛者却喊道，一个老无名小卒在他的杯子里，这太冷漠了，他不会落后于他的领先地位。但这只是为了掩盖他蹲在霍恩大厅里时的绝望。他确实一下子就喝了一口，以唤起一颗仁慈的心，因为它在整个天空中发出长长的隆隆声，以至于麦登大师，虔诚的某些时候，在厄运的裂缝中敲打了他的肋骨，而布鲁姆大师，在吹牛者的旁边，对他说了一些平静的话，以消除他的巨大恐惧，广告说这不是别的东西，只是他听到的喧闹噪音，从雷雨云中排出液体，你看，已经发生了，所有的秩序都发生了。自然现象。

But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.
但卡尔默的话消除了年轻的博阿斯特哈德的恐惧吗？不，因为他心中有一颗名为苦涩的尖刺，无法用言语消除。那么他是不是既不像那个人那样冷静，又不像另一个人那样虔诚呢？他也没有像他希望的那样。但他难道不能像年轻时那样努力重新找到当时与他共存的神圣之瓶吗？事实上，格蕾丝并不在那里找到那个瓶子。然后他在那一声掌声中听到了神灵的声音，或者用卡尔默的话来说，是现象的喧嚣？听到？哎呀，他只能听到，除非他把他的理解管塞住（他没有这么做）。因为通过那根管子，他看到自己身处现象之地，有一天他必须死去，因为他就像其他人一样，也是一场过眼云烟的表演。他难道不会接受像其他人一样死去并去世吗？他决不会认为他必须也不会像男人对待妻子那样做更多的表演，而现象在法律一书中命令他们这样做。然后，他对那片叫做“相信我”的土地一无所知，那是应许之地，属于国王，令人愉快，将永远在那里，没有死亡，没有出生，也没有妻子或母亲，所有人都将在那里相信的人都来吗？ 是的，虔诚告诉过他那片土地，贞洁也给他指了路，但原因是他在途中遇到了一个外表令人赏心悦目的妓女，她说她的名字叫“手中的鸟”她用阿谀奉承的方式误导了他，让他偏离了正道，她对他说：“嗬，你这个漂亮男人，到这里来，我带你去一个勇敢的地方。”格鲁特，这被称为“丛林中的二人”，或者，一些博学的人，称为“肉欲的欲望”。

This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.
这是所有坐在母亲庄园公共场所的人们最渴望的东西，如果他们遇到了这个妓女手中的鸟（它存在于所有邪恶的瘟疫、怪物和邪恶的魔鬼中），他们就会最后，但他们会攻击她并认识她。对于“相信我”，他们说这只不过是一个概念，他们无法想象它的存在，因为，首先，“灌木丛中的两个人”，她认为他们是最好的洞穴，里面有四个枕头。那是四张票，上面印着这些字：Pickaback、Topsyturvy、Shameface 和 Cheek by Jowl，第二，对于那场恶毒的瘟疫 Allpox 和他们不关心的怪物，因为防腐剂给了他们一个坚固的牛肠盾牌，第三，这样他们就不会受到后代的伤害，而后代就是那个邪恶的魔鬼，凭借这个被称为“杀子”的盾牌。卡维尔先生和有时虔诚先生、阿佩·斯威勒先生、假富兰克林先生、丹蒂·迪克森先生、杨·博斯特哈德和谨慎·卡尔默先生也都陷入了盲目的幻想。哦，可怜的同伴们，你们都被欺骗了，因为那是上帝的声音，他处于非常严重的愤怒中，他很快就会举起手臂，因为他们违背他的诺言而进行的虐待和溢出行为而溢出他们的灵魂。它将带来布伦宁的祈祷。

So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford’s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, be having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue. ‘Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.
所以六月十六日星期四帕特克。迪格纳姆被埋在中风的粘土里，在严重干旱之后，上帝保佑，下雨了，一个驳船工从五十英里左右的地方乘水而来，带着草皮说种子不会发芽，田地干渴，颜色非常悲伤，臭气熏天，斑鸠和托夫茨也是。呼吸困难，所有年轻的急流都干净地消耗掉，很久以前没有洒水，因为没有人记得没有洒水。玫瑰色的花蕾全都变成了棕色，散开成一团一团，山上除了干枯的旗帜和柴草外什么也没有，一旦着火就会着火。全世界都说，他们不知道，去年二月那场大风对这片土地造成了如此可悲的破坏，与这片荒芜相比，这只是一件小事。但渐渐地，如前所述，今天晚上日落之后，风从西边吹来，随着夜色渐深，可以看到更大的膨胀的云层，气象学家开始注视着它们，在上午十点多的时候，早晚会出现一些片状闪电。钟声敲响，伴随着一声长长的雷声，伴随着一阵摇晃，所有人都在门内乱窜，准备冒烟的淋浴，男人们用木棍或头巾为吸管遮风挡雨，女人们则穿着裙子，在倾盆大雨来临之际，跳了起来。 。在伊利广场，巴格特街，杜克大学的草坪，从那里穿过梅林绿地，一直到霍尔斯街，一片水流在干涸之前流过，没有看到任何椅子、马车或马车，但在那之后就没有再出现裂缝。反对 Rt。尊敬的。菲茨吉本法官先生的门（即与大学土地上的律师希利先生坐在一起）马尔。马里根是一位绅士中的绅士，只不过是来自摩尔先生的作家（他是一个教皇，但现在，人们说，是一个好的威廉派）偶然与亚历克对抗。 剪着短发的班农（现在穿着肯德尔绿色的舞蹈斗篷）刚从穆林加尔来到镇上，他的同事和马尔·M的兄弟将在舞台上待一个月，直到圣斯威辛，他问他到底在做什么在那里，他回家了，他去安德鲁·霍恩的家里喝了一杯酒，他说，但会告诉他一头易受惊吓的小母牛，她的年龄很大，牛肉到脚后跟，而这一切都被倒了雨就这样两人一起上了霍恩的。那里是利奥普。克劳福德的布鲁姆的日记与一群爱开玩笑的人坐在一起，他们可能是吵架的家伙，迪克森·朱恩，我的仁慈夫人文的学者。林奇，苏格兰人，威尔。马登·T·莱内汉 (T. Lenehan) 对他喜欢的赛车手和史蒂芬·D·利奥普 (Stephen D. Leop) 感到非常难过。布卢姆在那里度过了一段慵懒的时光，但现在好多了，今晚他梦见了他的夫人莫尔太太的奇怪幻想，她穿着一双火鸡内裤，穿着红色拖鞋，人们认为这是为了换换口味，而那里的普尔弗伊夫人，那是通过恳求她的肚子进来的，现在在大便上，可怜的身体，她的预产期过去了两天，助产士很痛，无法分娩，她想吃一碗米渣，这是一种精明的干燥剂他们说，她的内脏和呼吸非常重，应该是一个欺负男孩的人，但上帝很快就会给她问题。我听说，这是她活下来的第九只小鸡，戴夫人咬掉了她最后一只小鸡的指甲，那只小鸡当时已经十二个月大了，另外三只都是母乳喂养的，最后的死亡都被记载在国王的圣经中。她的中心五十多岁，是一位卫理公会教徒，但接受了圣礼，并且在任何公平的安息日都可以看到他的两个儿子在布洛克港附近用重型刹车卷轴敲打声音，或者在平底船上追寻比目鱼和鳕鱼并捕获一条鱼不错的包，我听说。 总而言之，一场无限大的降雨，一切都焕然一新，将大大增加收成，但肯尼迪人说，在风和水之后，火将会到来，以预言玛拉基的年鉴（我听说罗素先生也做了同样的预言咒语）从他的农民公报的印度斯坦语中得出的要点）总共有三件事，但这对于老太婆和拜恩来说只是毫无道理的取笑，但有时他们被发现在正确的猜测中，他们的怪异不知道如何。

With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ‘tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. Mort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe ‘tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More like ‘tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he. I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
说完，莱尼汉走到桌脚前，告诉他那封信是如何出现在当晚的公报上的，他假装要找到关于他的信（因为他发誓说他为此煞费苦心），但在斯蒂芬的信上在说服下，他放弃了搜查，并被要求坐在附近，他表现得非常敏捷。他是一位运动绅士，喜欢快乐的安德鲁或诚实的泡菜，而属于女人的东西、马肉或热门丑闻他都会拍打。说实话，他在财富方面很吝啬，大部分时间都渴望咖啡馆和低矮的酒馆，里面有卷边的人、马夫、赌徒、保罗的男人、跑步者、平底帽、马甲师、巴尼奥女士和其他游戏中的流氓或与经常在晚上直到大白天，他经常在他的麻袋之间捡起一些偶然的捕手或情报人员，其中有很多闲言碎语。他在一家沸腾的厨师店里吃着平常的饭菜，如果他吃到了一堆破碎的食物或一盘牛肚，钱包里装着一个裸露的测试仪，他总能用舌头让自己脱口而出，这是他从一个朋克那里学来的一些好色的俏皮话。或者诸如此类的事情，他们每个母亲的儿子都会爆裂他们的身体。另一个，也就是科斯特洛，听到这个演讲，问这是诗歌还是故事。老实说，不，他说，弗兰克（这是他的名字），“这都是关于将随着瘟疫一起宰杀的凯里奶牛的事。”但他们可以去吊死，他眨了眨眼睛说，对我来说，他们的牛肉很霸道，上面有痘。这罐子里的鱼和以前一样好，他非常友好地提出要拿一些咸鲱鱼，他当时一直在旁边看了看，发现了这个地方，这确实是他的大使馆的主要设计。是个锋利的人。 “Mort aux vaches”，当时弗兰克用法语说道，他与一家在波尔多拥有酒庄的白兰地运输商签订了契约，而且他说法语也像个绅士。弗兰克从小就一直是个混蛋，他的父亲是一个地方长官，他无法让他去学校学习字母和地球仪的使用，他被录取到大学学习机械，但他咬牙切齿地咬住了那颗牙。像一匹生马驹一样，对司法机构和教区执事比对他的书更熟悉。曾经他是一名演员，然后是一名萨特勒或威尔士人，然后没有什么可以阻止他远离熊坑和拉紧的主干，然后他就去海洋或与罗马人一起在路上蹄踏，绑架一个乡绅的继承人靠的是月光、女仆的亚麻布或树篱后窒息的鸡。他离开的次数就像猫的生命一样多次，又带着赤裸的口袋回到他的父亲那里，他的父亲每次见到他都会流下一品脱的眼泪。什么，利奥波德先生双手交叉，热切地想知道事情的走向，他们会屠杀所有人吗？ “我抗议我看到了他们，但今天早上去了利物浦的船，”他说。他说，我简直不敢相信事情竟然如此糟糕。他对育雏兽、跳马、油腻的小猪和羊毛有丰富的经验，几年前他曾担任约瑟夫·卡夫先生的精算师，约瑟夫·卡夫先生是一位值得尊敬的销售大师，在加文·洛先生的院子里大力推动他的牲畜和草地拍卖交易。普鲁士街。 “我在那里向你提问，”他说。更像是软管或木舌。 斯蒂芬先生有点感动，但非常客气地告诉他，没有这样的事情，他收到了皇帝的主要挑衅者的急件，感谢他的盛情款待，那就是派牛瘟博士来，他是全莫斯科最受引述的捕牛者，带着一两丸物理上不畏艰险。来吧，来吧，文森特先生说，平易近人。他说，如果他干涉一头爱尔兰公牛，他会发现自己陷入困境。斯蒂芬先生说，他的名字是爱尔兰人，本质上是爱尔兰人，他把麦芽酒送来了，就像英国瓷器店里的一头爱尔兰公牛一样。我怀上了你，迪克森先生说。这就是被农夫尼古拉斯送到我们岛上的那头公牛，他是最勇敢的养牛人，鼻子上戴着一个祖母绿戒指。文森特先生越过桌子说，对你来说是这样，他说是讨价还价的靶心，而一头更胖、更胖的公牛，他说，永远不会在三叶草上拉屎。他长着无数的角，身披金布，鼻孔里喷出甜蜜的烟熏气息，我们岛上的女人们留下面团球和擀面杖，跟在他后面，把他的恶霸挂在菊花链上。迪克森先生说，这是怎么回事，但在他遇到农夫尼古拉斯之前，他是一个太监，他被一群医生妥善地阉割了，而这些医生的境况并不比他好。所以现在就走吧，他说，按照哈利勋爵告诉你的所有我的表弟德国人的吩咐去做，接受农夫的祝福，说完他狠狠地拍了拍自己的屁股。 但文森特先生说，这一耳光和祝福让他成为了朋友，因为为了和好，他教给了他一个值得两个的把戏，因此女仆、妻子、女院长和寡妇直到今天都确认他们宁愿在一个月中的任何时候在黑暗的牛舍里在他耳边低语，或者用他神圣的长舌头舔一下后颈，而不是与全爱尔兰四个领域最优秀的魁梧年轻掠夺者躺在一起。另一个人接着说出了他的话：他说，他们给他穿上了圆点直筒连衣裙和衬裙，配上披肩和腰带，手腕上有褶边，剪掉了他的额发，用鲸蜡油给他擦了全身，并为他建造了马厩。路的拐角处有一个金马槽，里面装满了市场上最好的干草，这样他就可以尽情地撒粪。此时，信徒之父（他们这样称呼他）已经变得如此沉重，以至于他几乎无法走到牧场。为了弥补这一点，我们的好心的女士们用围裙给他送来了饲料，一旦他的肚子吃饱了，他就会用后腿站起来，向女士们展示一种神秘的感觉，并用公牛的语言咆哮和吼叫，他们都在追随他。哎呀，另一个人说，他被宠坏了，除了绿草之外，他什么都不肯在所有的土地上生长（因为那是他心目中唯一的颜色），中间的一个小山丘上竖起了一块木板。岛上有一张印刷的告示，上面写着：哈利勋爵起誓，绿色是长在地上的草。 而且，迪克森先生说，如果他在罗斯康蒙或康尼马拉的荒野中闻到掠牛者的气味，或者斯莱戈的农夫正在播种一把芥末或一袋油菜籽的气味，他就会在一半以上的时间里发疯。乡村里的一切植物都被他的角连根拔起，一切都是按照哈利勋爵的命令进行的。文森特先生说，他们之间一开始就存在不和，哈利勋爵称农夫尼古拉斯为世界上所有的老尼克斯，还有一个在他家里养了七个特鲁尔的老妓女，我会插手他的事情，他说。 “我会让那只动物闻到地狱的味道，”他说，借助我父亲留给我的那块美味的披萨。但有一天晚上，迪克森先生说，当哈利勋爵在赛艇比赛获胜后正在清理他的皇家毛皮，准备去吃晚饭时（他自己有铲桨，但课程的首要规则是其他人要用干草叉划船）他他发现自己与一头公牛有着惊人的相似之处，当他拿起一本放在储藏室里的黑拇指小册子时，他确信自己是罗马人著名的冠军公牛 Bos Bovum 的左撇子后裔，Bos Bovum 是一个很好的沼泽拉丁语。节目的老板。文森特先生说，此后，哈利勋爵当着所有朝臣的面把他的头放进牛的饮水槽里，然后又把头拉出来，告诉他们他的新名字。然后，随着水从他身上流走，他穿上了一件属于他祖母的旧罩衫和裙子，买了一本公牛语言的语法来学习，但除了他学到的第一个人称代词之外，他一个字也学不到。抄下来，然后背下来，如果他出去散步，他会在口袋里装满粉笔，写在他喜欢的东西上，比如岩石边、茶馆桌子、棉花包或软木浮子上。 简而言之，他和爱尔兰公牛很快就成了好朋友，就像驴子和衬衫一样。斯蒂芬先生说，结果是，岛上的男人们看不到任何帮助，就像那些忘恩负义的妇女们都一心一意一样，造了一艘渡轮木筏，把自己和成捆的动产装上船，把所有的东西都放在船上。桅杆竖起，操纵帆桁，弹起船帆，起航，在风中铺开三张布，将她的头放在风和水之间，起锚，打开舵，跑上快乐罗杰号，给了三乘三，让牛头跑，驾驶他们的小船出发，出海收复美洲大陆。 文森特先生说，正是在这个场合，一位水手长创作了这首欢快的圣歌：

—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.
——教皇彼得只是个尿床。

A man’s a man for a’ that.
男人就是男人。

Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator. Lambay Island. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. ‘Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.
我们的熟人马拉奇·穆里根先生现在出现在门口，当时学生们正在完成他们的辩解，他的陪伴是他刚刚遇到的一位朋友，一位年轻的绅士，他的名字叫亚历克·班农，他来晚了，他打算买下这座城市。栅栏和战争列表中的颜色或角色。马里根先生很有礼貌地表达了对它的更多兴趣，因为它跳出了他自己的一个项目，以治愈所触及的邪恶。随后，他将一套纸板卡片交给了公司，这些卡片是他当天在奎内尔先生家打印的，上面用漂亮的斜体字印着一个传奇人物：马拉奇·穆里根先生。肥料和孵化器。兰贝岛。正如他继续阐述的那样，他的计划是从那些无所事事的享乐中抽身而出，例如福普林·波平杰爵士和米尔克索普·奎德努克爵士在城里的主要事务，而致力于我们的身体有机体所承担的最高尚的任务。陷害。好吧，让我们听听吧，好朋友，迪克森先生说。我毫不怀疑这带有嫖客的味道。来吧，两位都坐下。坐着和站着一样便宜。马里根先生接受了邀请，并详细阐述了他的设计，他告诉听众，他是因为考虑了不育的原因而产生了这个想法，包括抑制性和禁止性，以及抑制是否是由于婚姻造成的。烦恼或平衡的简约性，以及禁令是否源于先天缺陷或后天习性。 他说，看到婚榻上最珍贵的誓言被骗走，他感到非常悲伤；想到这么多和蔼可亲、拥有丰富婚姻的女性，她们是最卑鄙的和尚的牺牲品，她们把火炬藏在一个不合意的修道院或修道院的斗下。当她们可能会增加幸福的入口时，她们会在一些不负责任的麝香的怀抱中失去她们的女性魅力，当一百个漂亮的家伙在身边爱抚时，牺牲她们性中不可估量的宝石，他向她们保证，这让他的心哭泣。为了遏制这种不便（他的结论是由于潜热的抑制），在咨询了某些有价值的顾问并检查了此事后，他决定以简单的费用从兰贝岛的持有人，领主那里永久购买兰贝岛的永久业权。塔尔博特·马拉海德 (Talbot de Malahide)，一位著名的保守党绅士，非常支持我们的优势党。他提议在那里建立一个名为奥法洛斯的国家施肥农场，并按照埃及的风格凿成并竖立一座方尖碑，并为任何生活等级的女性提供尽职尽责的受孕服务，无论谁应该在那里指导他带着实现她自然功能的愿望。他说，钱不是问题，他也不会为了自己的辛苦而拿一分钱。即使是最贫穷的厨房女工，也不亚于富裕的时尚女士，如果她们的结构和脾气是她们请愿的热情说服者，就会在他身上找到自己的男人。对于他的营养，他展示了如何只以美味的结节、鱼和圆锥肉为食，强烈推荐这些后来多产的啮齿动物的肉，用狼牙棒和豆荚或豆荚或肉豆蔻刀片烤或炖。两个辣椒。 在他以极大的热情和坚定的态度讲道之后，马里根先生立刻从帽子上摘下一条他用来遮住帽子的头巾。他们俩似乎都被大雨淋湿了，尽管他们在努力弥补，但他们的步伐还是被水浸湿了，从穆里根先生的霍登灰色小衣服上可以看出，现在已经有点花斑了。与此同时，他的项目受到了审计员的一致好评，并赢得了所有人的衷心赞誉，尽管玛丽的迪克森先生对此表示反对，并挑剔地询问他是否也打算将煤炭运往纽卡斯尔。然而，穆里根先生通过恰当地引用经典著作来迎合学者，因为这些经典著作在他的记忆中，对他来说似乎是对他的论点的合理而有品味的支持：Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsisestionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt，而对于那些粗鲁的机智的人来说，他通过更适合他们胃的动物王国的类比，林间空地的雄鹿和母鹿，农家的公鸭和鸭子。

Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ‘tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.
这位健谈的人对自己的优雅相当看重，确实是一个正派的人，现在，当公司对他所推进的项目大肆赞扬时，由于突然出现的异想天开的气氛，这位健谈的人对自己的衣服感到有些不满。这位年轻的绅士，他的朋友，对他最近遇到的一段经历感到非常高兴，忍不住告诉他最近的邻居。马里根先生看到了桌子，问那些面包和鱼是给谁的，看到陌生人，他向他礼貌地鞠了一躬，说：“请问，先生，您需要我们提供的任何专业帮助吗？”在他的提议下，他非常衷心地感谢他，尽管保持了适当的距离，并回答说他是为了一位女士而来的，她现在是霍恩家里的居民，她的状况很有趣，身体很差，因为女人的不幸（和说到这里，他深深地叹了口气）想知道她的幸福是否已经发生了。迪克森先生为了扭转局势，继续询问穆里根先生本人，他的早期心室潜能是否预示着前列腺囊或男性子宫中的卵母细胞妊娠，或者是由于，就像著名的医生奥斯汀先生那样。梅尔登，肚子里有狼。为了回答这个问题，穆里根先生在一阵大笑中，勇敢地击打自己的横膈膜下方，模仿格罗根妈妈（她是性别中最优秀的生物，但遗憾的是她是个流浪汉），模仿着令人钦佩的滑稽喊道：有一个肚子从来没有生过私生子。这真是一个令人高兴的自负，它重新掀起了一阵欢乐的风暴，让整个房间陷入了最剧烈的喜悦之中。活泼的拨浪鼓以同样的模仿方式继续进行，但在前厅里有一些拉鲁姆。

Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Mais bien sûr, noble stranger, said he cheerily, et mille compliments. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ‘pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a marchand de capotes, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, ventre biche, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, sans blague, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A livre! cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath … But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.
听者正是那位苏格兰学生，有点生气，金发碧眼，以最活泼的方式向这位年轻绅士表示祝贺，并在一个显着的地方打断了叙述，礼貌地示意他要签证。礼貌地递给他一壶热开水的同时，他的头部带着疑问的姿态（整整一个世纪的礼貌教养还没有达到如此好的姿态），这与瓶子的同等但相反的平衡结合在一起像以往那样直白地问叙述者是否可以请他喝一杯。 Mais bien sûr，高贵的陌生人，他高兴地说道，et mille 恭维。这样你就可以而且非常巧合地。除了这个杯子来给我的幸福加冕之外，别无他求。但是，仁慈的老天爷，如果我的钱包里只剩下一块面包皮和一杯井里的水，我的上帝，我会接受它们，并在我的心里找到跪在地上感谢力量的动力。以上是美好事物的赐予者赐予我的幸福。说着，他把高脚杯凑到唇边，沾沾自喜地喝了一口甜酒，捋了捋头发，打开胸膛，取出一个挂在丝带上的小盒坠子，那张照片自从她的手以来他就一直珍藏着。曾在其中写道。 带着温柔的世界凝视着这些容貌，啊，先生，他说，你是否也像我一样，在那动人的瞬间用这双眼睛看到了她，戴着她那精致的塔克和她的新风骚帽子（正如她所说，这是她的节日礼物）我漂亮地）在如此天真的混乱中，在如此融化的温柔中，“以我的良心来说，即使是您，先生，也被慷慨的本性所驱使，将自己完全交付给这样的敌人手中，或者永远退出战场。我声明，我一生中从未如此感动过。上帝，我感谢你，你是我生命的创造者！受到如此可爱的生物的恩惠，他会倍感幸福。一声深情的叹息使这句话变得雄辩，他把挂坠盒放回怀里，擦了擦眼睛，再次叹了口气。仁慈的传播者，为你所有的生物祝福，你的暴政是多么伟大和普遍，它可以束缚自由和束缚，简单的情夫和光鲜亮丽的花花公子，鲁莽激情全盛时期的情人和丈夫更成熟的岁月。但事实上，先生，我偏离了主题。我们所有的尘世欢乐是多么混杂和不完美。恶意！他痛苦地喊道。但愿上帝有先见之明，还记得我带上我的斗篷！想到这我就想哭。然后，虽然下了七场阵雨，但我们俩的情况都没有恶化。但天哪，他拍着额头喊道，明天又是新的一天了，我认识一位名叫波因茨先生的商人，从他那里我可以花一里弗买到一件法国人的斗篷。时尚一如既往地防止女士尿湿。啧啧啧！ Le Fecondateur 喊道，绊倒了，我的朋友摩尔先生，这位最有成就的旅行者（我刚刚在镇上最聪明的人的圈子里开了半瓶 AVEC LUI），是我的权威，在合恩角，文特雷比什，他们一场大雨会打湿任何东西，即使是最坚固的斗篷。他告诉我，这种暴力的浸透，没有瘟疫，已经将不止一个不幸的家伙急忙送往另一个世界。呸!一里弗！林奇先生喊道。笨拙的东西一分钱一分贵。一把伞，如果不是仙蘑菇那么大，也抵得上十个这样的权宜之计。任何有智慧的女人都不会戴它。我亲爱的基蒂今天告诉我，她会在洪水中跳舞，然后她就会在这样的救赎方舟中挨饿，正如她提醒我的那样（调皮地红了脸，在我耳边低语，尽管除了令人眼花缭乱的蝴蝶之外，没有人可以打断她的话） ，大自然女士，在神圣的祝福下，已将其植入我们的心中，它已成为家喻户晓的词，“il y a deux”选择了我们最初服装的纯真，在其他情况下违反礼节，是最合适的，不， ，唯一的衣服。第一个，她说（这里是我漂亮的哲学家，当我把她交给她的蒂尔伯里，以集中我的注意力时，用她的舌头轻轻地触碰我耳朵的外腔），第一个是洗澡……但此时铃声响起大厅里的叮当声打断了一场勇敢地承诺要丰富我们知识储备的演讲。

Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.
在大家空虚的欢闹声中，铃声响起，正当所有人都在猜测可能的原因时，卡兰小姐走了进来，低声跟年轻的迪克森先生说了几句话，然后向大家深深鞠了一躬，退了出去。 。一个女人在一群放荡的人中出现，即使是片刻，她也表现出各种端庄的品质，而且不亚于美丽，即使是最放荡的人也不会做出幽默的俏皮话，但她的离开却是下流行为爆发的信号。 “你真傻，”科斯特洛说道，他是一个昏昏沉沉的低等家伙。一块巨大的细牛肉！我发誓她已经和你约会了。什么，你狗？你有办法对付他们吗？林奇先生说，盖德的花蕾非常好。这是他们在马特临终关怀医院使用的床边方式。天哪，奥加尔格医生没有把修女们扔到下巴下面吗？当我希望得到拯救时，我从我的小猫那里得到了它，她在这七个月里一直是那里的女仆。劳克萨默西，医生，穿着樱草色背心的年轻血液喊道，假装女人般的傻笑，身体不谦虚地蠕动，你是如何戏弄身体​​的！该死的男人！上帝保佑我，我现在已经摇摇欲坠了。哎呀，你和亲爱的小坎特基瑟姆神父一样坏！科斯特洛喊道，如果她不合家常，愿这一锅四份半让我窒息。我认识一位女士，当我注视她时，她很快就出现了白色肿胀。然而，这位年轻的外科医生站起来，恳求公司原谅他撤退，因为护士刚刚通知他，病房需要他。仁慈的上天很高兴地让这位女士的痛苦暂时结束，她以值得称赞的毅力忍受了这些痛苦，并生下了一个活泼的男孩。 他说，我需要耐心对待那些没有智慧去激发活力，也没有学会指导的人，他们谩骂这种高尚的职业，这种职业保存了对神的敬畏，是地球上幸福的最大力量。当我说，如果需要的话，我可以为她的崇高实践的卓越性提供大量见证人时，我是肯定的，这远非成为一个代名词，而应该成为人类胸中的光荣激励。我无法摆脱他们。什么？诽谤这样一位可爱的卡兰小姐，她是自己性别的光彩，也是我们性别的惊讶？在那一刻，最重要的事情会降临在一个微不足道的粘土孩子身上？灭掉这个念头吧！一想到这个种族的未来，我就感到不寒而栗，在这个种族中，这种恶意的种子已经播下，霍恩家族的母亲和女仆没有得到应有的尊重。他摆脱了这种责备，向路边的人行了个礼，然后走到了门口。所有人都发出了一阵赞同的低声议论，有些人赞成毫不费力地驱逐低浸泡者，如果他没有用可怕的咒语来肯定自己的罪行（因为他用手掌发誓）说他是真正的好儿子。他说，“让我的生命垂危”，这始终是诚实的弗兰克·科斯特洛的情感，我从小就被养大，特别是为了尊敬你的父母，他们最擅长吃rolypoly或匆忙的布丁，就像你看到我总是看起来的样子一样。带着一颗充满爱的心回来。

To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.
回到布卢姆先生，他在第一次进入后就意识到了一些无礼的嘲笑，但他忍受了这些嘲笑，认为这是那个时代的成果，人们普遍指责这个时代不懂得怜悯。诚然，年轻的火花就像长大的孩子一样充满了夸张：他们吵闹的讨论中的话语很难理解，而且常常不好听：他们的脾气暴躁和令人发指的台词使他的智力望而却步：他们也没有认真地意识到尽管他们拥有强大的动物精神，但礼节却代表了他们。但科斯特洛先生的话对他来说是一种不受欢迎的语言，因为他让这个可怜虫感到恶心，在他看来，这个可怜虫是一个畸形的凸嘴、剪短了头发的生物，非婚生的，像一个长着牙齿、脚先着地的驼背人一样插入到这个世界上。他头骨上的外科医生钳子确实给他增添了色彩，使他想起了已故聪明才智达尔文先生所寻求的创造之链中缺失的一环。现在，在我们规定的岁月中，他已经经历了千百次的沧桑，而且，作为一个谨慎的上升者和一个罕见的预测者，他命令他的心抑制所有上升的运动。愤怒，并通过最容易的预防措施拦截它们，在他的胸中培养一种充分的忍耐，这种忍耐受到卑鄙的思想者的嘲笑，鲁莽的判断者的蔑视，而所有人都认为可以容忍，但可以容忍。 对于那些以牺牲女性柔弱为代价来创造自己的智慧的人（他从来没有坚持过这种思维习惯），他不会承认他们的名字，也不会继承适当教养的传统：而对于这样的人，失去了所有的忍耐，不能再失去了，经验的锐利解药仍然存在，可以使他们的傲慢和不光彩的撤退。不是，而是他对勇敢的年轻人所能感受到的，他们不关心老糊涂的割草或严厉的抱怨，永远（正如神圣作者的纯洁幻想所表达的那样）禁止吃树，但到目前为止还不是这样。当一位淑女在她的合法场合时，无论在任何条件下，都应预先考虑人道。总而言之，虽然从姐姐的话来看，他认为自己会很快分娩，但是，必须承认，在经历了如此胁迫的磨难之后，问题如此顺利，现在再次证明了怜悯，这一点至少得到了缓解。以及至高无上的恩赐。

Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. ‘Slife, I’ll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.
因此，他向他的邻居打破了他的想法，说，为了表达他对这件事的看法，他的观点（也许不应该表达这种观点）是，一个人必须具有冷漠的体质和冷漠的天才，才能不为这个最新鲜的事物感到高兴。她被监禁的消息传来，因为她一直承受着如此痛苦，而这并不是她的过错。这位衣着考究的年轻刀片说，是她丈夫的期望让她有了这样的期望，或者至少应该如此，除非她是另一位以弗所的主妇。 “我必须告诉你，”克罗瑟斯先生一边说，一边拍着桌子，以引起大家一致强调，老荣耀阿勒鲁尤鲁姆今天又来了，一位穿着粗布衣服的老人，更愿意通过鼻子请求我的威廉明娜的消息。生活，正如他对她的称呼。我吩咐他做好准备，以免事件很快爆发。 ‘Slife，我会在你身边。我不得不赞叹这个老家伙的男子气概，她仍然可以把另一个孩子从她身上打下来。所有人都对它赞不绝口，每个人都按照自己的方式，尽管同一位年轻的刀锋坚持他以前的观点，认为除了她的配偶之外，还有一个男人，一个订单办事员，一个接线员（有道德的）或一个流动的小贩每个家庭都需要的物品。奇怪的是，客人与自己交谈，他们所拥有的极其不平等的轮回能力，产后宿舍和解剖剧院应该是如此轻浮的神学院，仅仅获得学术头衔就足以在短时间内转变这些轻浮的追随者成为了一种艺术的模范实践者，而大多数杰出人物都将这种艺术视为最高贵。 但是，他进一步补充说，这或许可以缓解他们共同压抑的压抑情绪，因为我不止一次观察到，物以类聚的鸟儿在一起欢笑。

But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.
但是，问问高贵的领主，他的赞助人，这位仁慈的王子让步承认其公民权利的外国人，有什么资格使自己成为我们内部政体的至高无上的领主呢？忠诚本应带来的感激之情现在在哪里？在最近的战争中，每当敌人用他的格拉纳多获得暂时的优势时，这个叛徒就不会抓住这个时机，对他作为佃户的帝国随意发动攻击，而他却在为自己百分之四的人的安全而战战兢兢。 ？难道他忘记了这一点，就像他忘记了所有收到的好处一样？或者说，他从一个欺骗他人的人，最终变成了他自己的受骗者，如果报道不假的话，他就是他自己的、他唯一的享受者？侵犯一位受人尊敬的女士、一位英勇少校的女儿的卧室，或者对她的美德进行最遥远的反思，这绝不是坦率的行为，但如果他在那里挑战注意力（因为他确实不这样做确实是非常感兴趣的）那就这样吧。不幸的女人，她已经太久了，太顽固地否认了自己的合法特权，除了绝望的嘲笑之外，她没有任何其他感觉来听他的谴责。他这样说，是一位道德审查员，一位非常虔诚的鹈鹕，他毫不顾忌，忘记了自然的联系，试图与来自社会最底层的女佣进行非法性交！不仅如此，要不是那个贱人的洗涤刷是她的守护天使，它就会像埃及人夏甲一样与她同在！在牧场问题上，他的脾气暴躁是出了名的，在库夫先生的听证会上，一位愤怒的牧场主对他进行了严厉的反驳，其措辞直白而田园诗般。他传讲福音是不合适的。 他家附近不是有一块因缺乏犁铧而休耕的种子田吗？青春期应受谴责的习惯是第二天性，但到了中年却会受到谴责。如果他必须用味道可疑的灵丹妙药和格言来分发基列香膏来恢复一代未成熟的放荡者的健康，那么他的做法就应该更好地符合他现在全神贯注的教义。他婚姻中的乳房是秘密的宝库，出于礼节，他不愿意透露这些秘密。一些褪色的美人的淫荡暗示可能会安慰他，因为他是一个被忽视和放荡的配偶，但这位新的道德倡导者和疾病治疗者在他最好的情况下是一棵异国之树，当扎根于本土东方时，它会蓬勃发展，并充满香脂。但是，移植到气候更加温和的地方后，它的根就失去了往日的活力，而从它身上长出来的东西则变得停滞、酸性且不起作用。

The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.
这个消息是在谨慎的情况下传达的，让人回想起第二位女医务人员向驻地初级医疗官员使用崇高门的仪式，后者又向代表团宣布一位继承人已经出生，当他亲自前往医院时在内政大臣和枢密院成员在场的情况下，在妇女公寓协助举行规定的胎衣仪式，代表们在一致的疲惫和认可中保持沉默，他们对长时间和庄严的守夜感到恼火，并希望快乐的事情会减轻放纵的感觉，而阿比盖尔和产科医生同时缺席会使放纵变得更容易，立刻爆发出一场舌战。布卢姆先生竭力催促、安抚、克制，但徒劳无功。这个时刻对于表现出那种漫不经心的态度来说太有利了，而这种漫不经心的态度似乎是在如此不同的脾气之间团结起来的唯一纽带。 情况的每一个阶段都被相继揭露：子宫兄弟的产前厌恶、剖腹产、死后对父亲的尊重，以及更罕见的对母亲的尊重，被称为“柴尔兹谋杀案”的兄弟相残案，令人难忘。律师布什先生的慷慨激昂的抗辩确保了被错误指控的人无罪释放，涉及双胞胎和三胞胎的长子继承权和国王恩赐，模拟或掩饰的流产和杀婴，由于充血导致的无心胎儿和无视，中颌畸形某些无下巴的中国人（候选人穆里根先生引用）是由于上颌骨突沿中线重新连接有缺陷，以便（正如他所说）一只耳朵可以听到另一只耳朵说话，麻醉或黄昏睡眠的好处，延长时间妊娠后期由于静脉受压而引起的阵痛、羊水过早减少（如实际情况所示）以及随之而来的母体败血症的危险、通过注射器进行人工授精、随之而来的子宫复旧更年期时的问题，女性因不法强奸而怀孕的问题，勃兰登堡人施图茨格伯特所称的令人痛苦的分娩方式，记录在月经期间或月经期间受孕的多精、双精和畸形分娩的实例。近亲父母——总之，亚里士多德在他的彩色平版插图杰作中对人类诞生的所有情况进行了分类。 产科和法医学中最严重的问题与关于怀孕状态的最流行的信念一样受到热烈的研究，例如禁止怀孕的妇女跨过乡村的栅栏，以免她的动作导致脐带勒死她的生物，如果她有强烈的渴望但没有效果，她就会被命令把手放在她身体的那个部位上，这个部位长期被用作惩罚的部位。有人声称兔唇、胸痣、多指、黑人墨迹、草莓斑和鲜红斑痣等异常现象是对那些猪头婴儿（格里塞尔·斯蒂文斯夫人的例子没有被忘记）或偶尔出生的狗毛婴儿的表面证据和自然假设解释。喀里多尼亚特使提出的质质记忆假说符合他所代表的土地的形而上学传统，设想在这种情况下胚胎发育会在人类之前的某个阶段停滞。一位古怪的代表以几乎令人信服的热情反对这两种观点，即女性与男性野兽交配的理论，他的权威是他自己对神话的支持，例如牛头怪的神话，这是天才的牛头怪的神话。这位优雅的拉丁诗人在他的《变形记》中将其传承给了我们。他的话给人的印象是立竿见影的，但却是短暂的。它很容易被抹去，就像候选人穆里根先生以一种幽默的方式唤起它一样，没有人比他更懂得如何表达，他把一个和蔼可亲、干净的老人视为最高的欲望对象。 与此同时，代表马登先生和候选人林奇先生之间就连体双胞胎先于另一人死亡而造成的司法和神学困境发生了激烈的争论，双方同意的困难被提交给布卢姆先生，以便立即提交给助理先生执事迪达勒斯。到目前为止，他一直保持沉默，无论是为了更好地通过超自然的重力来展示他所赋予的服装的奇怪尊严，还是为了服从内心的声音，他简短地、而且正如一些人认为的那样，敷衍地传达了教会的法令，禁止人破坏上帝的东西。已经加入。

But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared … Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked Poison. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope … Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: Lex talionis. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer’s ground.
但玛拉基亚斯的故事开始让他们感到恐惧。他脑海中浮现出眼前的场景。烟囱旁边的秘密面板向后滑动，凹处里出现了……海恩斯！我们谁不感到浑身毛骨悚然！他一手拿着一个装满凯尔特文献的文件夹，另一只手拿着一个标有毒药的小瓶。每个人的脸上都写满了惊讶、恐惧、厌恶，而他则带着鬼魅般的笑容看着他们。我预料到会有这样的接待，他以一阵怪异的笑声开始，看来这要归咎于历史。是的，它是真实的。我是杀害塞缪尔·柴尔兹的凶手。而我又受到怎样的惩罚！地狱对我来说并不可怕。这就是我身上的样子。皮重和年龄，我到底要以什么方式休息，他粗声粗气地嘟哝道，而我这次带着我的歌曲在都柏林漫步，而他则像灵魂或布拉乌鲁斯一样跟在我后面？我的地狱和爱尔兰的地狱都在今生。这就是我试图抹去我的罪行的方法。分心、打白嘴鸦、厄斯语（他背诵了一些）、鸦片酊（他把药瓶举到唇边）、露营。徒然！他的幽灵跟踪着我。毒品是我唯一的希望……啊！毁灭！黑豹！他大叫一声，突然消失了，面板滑了回去。过了一会儿，他的头出现在对面的门上，说：十一点十一点到韦斯特兰街车站来找我。他走了。泪水从消散的主人的眼中涌出。先知举手向天，低声念叨：马纳农的仇杀！圣人重复道：以牙还牙。感伤主义者是那些愿意享受所做的事情而不会承担巨额债务的人。玛拉基亚斯激动不已，停了下来。谜底揭开了。海恩斯是三弟。他的真名是查尔兹。黑豹本身就是他父亲的鬼魂。 他喝了毒品来消除。非常感谢这种缓解。墓地旁那栋孤零零的房子无人居住。没有灵魂会住在那里。蜘蛛在孤独中结网。夜行性的老鼠从洞里向外张望。它身上有一个诅咒。它闹鬼。凶手之地。

What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (fiat!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath ‘twas done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee—and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.
人的灵魂年龄是多少岁？正如她具有变色龙的美德，每当有新的接触时，她的色调都会改变，随着快乐而欢快，随着沮丧而悲伤，所以她的年龄也随着她的情绪而变化。利奥波德不再是那个稳重的宣传代理人和基金中少量物质的持有者，因为他坐在那里，沉思着，咀嚼着回忆。二十多年的时光一扫而空。他就是年轻的利奥波德。在那里，就像在回顾性安排中一样，镜子中的镜子（嘿，很快！），他看到了自己。那个年轻的身影，早熟的男子气概，在一个寒冷的早晨从克兰布拉希尔街的老房子步行到高中，他的书包背在腰上，里面有一块美味的小麦面包，这是母亲的想法。或者是同一个人物，大约一年过去了，戴着他的第一顶安全帽（啊，那是一天！），已经上路了，一个成熟的家族企业旅行者，配备了订单簿，一条有香味的手帕（不只是为了展示），他的一盒明亮的小饰品（唉！现在已经成为过去了！），还有一个颤抖的顺从的微笑，为这个或那个半成功的家庭主妇在她的指尖上算计它，或者为一个崭露头角的处女，害羞地承认（但心脏？告诉我！）他研究过的贝塞莫因。气味、微笑，但更重要的是，黑眼睛和油腻的地址，在黄昏时分给公司负责人带来了许多委托，他们在父辈英格尔的劳动之后坐在雅各布的烟斗上（一顿面条，你可以肯定，正在加热），通过圆角眼镜阅读一个月前来自欧洲的一些论文。但是，嘿，转眼间，镜子被吹了一口气，年轻的骑士骑士退却了，枯萎了，缩小成了雾中的一个小斑点。 现在他自己就是父亲了，他周围的这些人可能是他的儿子。谁能说一下？明智的父亲了解自己的孩子。他想起了哈奇街的第一个毛毛细雨的夜晚，就在保税商店旁边。他们一起（她是一个可怜的流浪儿，一个耻辱的孩子，你的和我的，以及所有的光秃秃的先令和她的幸运便士），他们一起听到手表沉重的脚步声，两个披着雨衣的影子经过新的皇家大学。布里迪！布莱迪·凯利！他永远不会忘记这个名字，永远记得那个夜晚：第一个晚上，新婚之夜。他们在最深处的黑暗中纠缠在一起，有意志的人与有意志的人，刹那间（命令！）光明将淹没世界。心有没有跳到心上？不，公平的读者。一口气就完成了，但是——等等！后退！一定不是！可怜的女孩惊恐地穿过黑暗逃走了。她是黑暗的新娘，黑夜的女儿。她不敢生下阳光明媚的金色宝贝。不，利奥波德。名字和记忆不能给你安慰。你年轻时对力量的幻想被剥夺了——而且是徒劳的。你的亲生儿子不属于你。对于利奥波德来说，现在已经没有人了，就像利奥波德对于鲁道夫来说一样。

The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.
声音在阴云密布的寂静中混合融合：寂静是无限的空间：灵魂迅速、安静地飘过世世代代的循环区域。灰色的暮色永远降临的地区，却从未落在广阔的鼠尾草绿色牧场上，褪去黄昏，散落星星的常年露珠。她迈着笨拙的步伐跟随她的母亲，一匹母马牵着她的小马驹。他们是暮色中的幻影，却有着预言般优雅的结构、纤细匀称的腰部、柔软的肌腱颈部、温顺而忧虑的头骨。它们消失了，悲伤的幻影：一切都消失了。阿根达斯是一片荒地，是尖叫鸟和沙盲乌普帕的家园。内塔伊姆，黄金，已不复存在。他们在云端的大道上而来，低语着叛逆的雷霆，野兽的幽灵。哈！听着！哈！视差在后面尾随并刺激他们，其额头上的闪电像蝎子一样。麋鹿和牦牛，巴珊和巴比伦的公牛，猛犸象和乳齿象，它们成群结队地来到沉没的大海——死亡之湖。不祥复仇的黄道宿主！它们在云端上呻吟着，有角的，有摩羯的，有獠牙的，有喇叭的，有狮鬃的，有巨角的，有鼻子的，爬行的，啮齿动物，反刍动物和厚皮动物，所有它们移动的呻吟声都是太阳的谋杀者。

Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.
他们跋涉前往死海，喝着未熟化的、可怕的大口大口地喝着令人昏昏欲睡的、取之不尽的盐分洪水。马的预兆再次出现，在荒凉的天空中被放大，不亚于天堂本身的大小，直到它笼罩在处女座的宫位上。看哪，轮回的奇迹，就是她，永恒的新娘，晨星的预兆，新娘，永远的处女。是她，玛莎，你失去了一个，米莉森特，年轻的，亲爱的，容光焕发的。她现在是多么平静地出现，是昴星团中的女王，在倒数第二个安特鲁坎时刻，穿着亮金色的凉鞋，戴着你称之为薄纱的面纱。它漂浮着，围绕着她星辰般的肉体流淌，流淌着，翡翠色、蓝宝石色、紫红色和天芥菜色，在寒冷的星际风的流动中持续，蜿蜒、盘绕、简单地旋转、在天空中扭动，一种神秘的书写，直到无数次之后。象征的变形，它闪耀着，阿尔法，金牛座额头上的红宝石和三角形标志。

Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man’s face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.
弗朗西斯让史蒂芬想起了多年前康米时代他们一起上学的情景。他询问了格劳孔、亚西比德、皮西斯特拉图的情况。他们现在在哪里？两人都不知道。 “你谈到了过去及其幻影，”斯蒂芬说。为什么要想到他们？如果我把他们召唤到忘川水域的另一边，可怜的鬼魂不会成群结队地响应我的召唤吗？谁猜想呢？我，布斯·斯蒂芬努梅诺斯，与公牛为友的吟游诗人，是他们生命的主宰和给予者。他用藤叶编成的花环围住了蓬乱的头发，对文森特微笑。文森特对他说，这个答案和那些叶子将更加贴切地装饰你，当你的天才父亲比一大堆轻松的颂歌更胜一筹时。所有祝你幸福的人都希望你如此。所有人都渴望看到你拿出你所思考的作品，为你喝彩。我衷心希望你不要让他们失望。哦，不，文森特·莱内汉说，将一只手放在他旁边的肩膀上。没有恐惧。他不能让母亲成为孤儿。年轻人的脸色顿时阴沉下来。所有人都可以看出，让他想起自己的诺言和最近的损失对他来说是多么困难。要不是喧闹的声音平息了他的痛苦，他早就退出宴会了。马登在权杖上因为骑手名字的突发奇想而损失了五个德拉克马：Lenehan 以及更多。他向他们讲述了比赛的情况。旗子倒了，啊！出发，奔跑，母马带着0新鲜跑了出来。疯狂起来。她在该领域处于领先地位。所有的心都在跳动。就连菲莉丝也忍不住了。她挥舞着围巾，喊道：哈扎！权杖获胜！但在直道上，当一切都处于紧密状态时，黑马“Throwaway”追平了她，到达并超过了她。现在一切都失去了。菲莉丝沉默了：她的眼睛是悲伤的海葵。朱诺，她哭道，我完蛋了。 但她的爱人安慰了她，并给她带来了一个明亮的金匣子，里面放着一些她吃了的椭圆形糖李。一滴泪水落下：只有一滴。莱内汉说，W·莱恩是一根能抽打的细鞭子。昨天有四名获奖者，今天有三名获奖者。哪个骑手能像他一样？让他骑上骆驼或喧闹的水牛，慢跑的胜利仍然属于他。但让我们像古老的习惯一样忍受它。怜悯那些不幸的人！可怜的权杖！他轻叹一声说道。她不再是原来的那匹小母马了。我们永远不会通过这只手看到这样的另一只手。天哪，先生，他们中的女王。你还记得她吗，文森特？ “我希望你今天能见到我的女王，”文森特说。她多么年轻，穿着黄色鞋子和棉布连衣裙，容光焕发（拉拉格在她身边很少见），我不知道它的正确名称。遮蔽我们的栗子正盛开：空气中弥漫着栗子令人信服的气味，花粉在我们身边飘扬。在阳光明媚的地方，人们很容易在石头上煮一批装有科林斯水果的面包，佩里利波梅内斯在桥附近的摊位上出售这些面包。但她的牙齿除了我抱着她的手臂之外什么也没有，当我靠得太近时，她会调皮地啃咬。一周前，她病了，在沙发上躺了四天，但今天她自由了，快乐地，嘲笑着危险。那么她就更加接受了。她的姿势很疯狂，当我们斜倚在一起时，她已经玩得很开心了。我的朋友，在你耳边，你不会想到当我们离开球场时谁遇见了我们。康米本人！他正走过树篱，读着一本更简洁的书，我怀疑，里面有一封来自格利塞拉或克洛伊的诙谐的信，以保留这一页。 这个可爱的生物在她的困惑中变色了，假装责备她衣服上的轻微混乱：一块底木粘在那里，因为树木都喜欢她。当康米走过时，她瞥了一眼她随身携带的小镜子里可爱的回声。但他一直很友善。他路过时祝福了我们。莱内汉说，诸神也是仁慈的。如果我对巴斯的母马运气不佳，也许他的这匹马可能更适合我。他正把手放在一个酒罐上：玛拉基看到了，并没有采取行动，指着陌生人和猩红色的标签。玛拉基小心翼翼地低声说道，保持德鲁伊的沉默。他的灵魂已经远去。从幻象中醒来也许和出生一样痛苦。任何物体，只要被认真对待，都可能成为通往诸神的不朽永恒的大门。你不这么认为吗，史蒂芬？狄奥索福斯告诉我，斯蒂芬回答道，前世埃及祭司曾向他传授业力法则的奥秘。狄奥索福斯告诉我，月亮的领主们，来自月球链阿尔法行星的橙火船不会承担以太双体，因此它们是由来自第二星座的红宝石色自我所化身。

However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was. entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.
然而，事实上，关于他处于某种低迷或其他或迷惑的描述中的荒谬猜测确实如此。完全是由于对最浅薄性格的误解，根本不是这样的。当上述情况发生时，视觉器官在这个时刻开始表现出动画症状的人，即使不比任何活着的人更精明，也和任何人一样精明，任何做出相反推测的人都会很快发现自己走错了商店。在过去四分钟左右的时间里，他一直盯着特伦特河畔伯顿的巴斯先生和他的公司装瓶的一定数量的第一名巴斯酒，这瓶酒恰好位于他所在位置对面的许多其他酒中，并且肯定是为了吸引别人的议论，因为它的猩红色外观。他只是简单而纯粹，因为随后发生的事情是出于他自己最清楚的原因，在前一刻对童年时代和地盘的观察之后，他回忆起了他自己的两三笔私人交易，这些原因使整个过程呈现出完全不同的面貌。另外两个人就像未出生的婴儿一样都是无辜的。然而最终，两人的目光相遇，当他意识到对方正在努力帮助自己做那件事时，他不由自主地决定亲自帮助他，于是他相应地抓住了中型玻璃容器的脖子。它含有所需的液体，并通过倒出大量液体在其中形成一个宽敞的孔，但同时，也需要相当程度的关注，以免扰乱其中的任何啤酒。地方。

The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.
随之而来的争论的范围和进展都是人生历程的缩影。无论是地方还是议会都不缺乏尊严。辩手们是这片土地上最敏锐的，他们所讨论的主题也是最崇高、最有活力的。霍恩家的高厅从未见过如此具有代表性和多样性的集会，该建筑的老椽子也从未听过如此百科全书式的语言。事实上，这真是一个壮丽的场面。克罗瑟斯穿着引人注目的高地服装坐在桌脚，他的脸因加洛韦马尔的海水而容光焕发。与他相对的还有林奇，他的脸上已经带着早期堕落和过早智慧的烙印。接下来，苏格兰人被分配给了古怪的科斯特洛，而在他身边，坐着的是马登，蹲着的样子冷漠无情。炉边的椅子确实空着，但在壁炉的两侧，班农穿着探险家套装、粗花呢短裤和咸牛皮布洛克鞋，与玛拉基·罗兰·圣约翰·穆里根的樱草色优雅和乡土举止形成鲜明对比。最后，在董事会的领导者是年轻的诗人，他在苏格拉底式讨论的欢乐气氛中找到了逃避教育学和形而上学探究的工作的避难所，而在他的左右两侧则安置了刚从竞技场出来的轻率的预言家，以及那个警惕的流浪者，被旅行和战斗的尘埃所玷污，被不可磨灭的耻辱的泥沼所玷污，但从他坚定不移的心中，任何诱惑、危险、威胁或堕落都无法抹去那笔激发铅笔灵感的性感可爱的形象。拉斐特的未来已经有很长一段时间了。

It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.
最好在此一开始就说明，S. Dedalus 先生（Div. Scep.）的论点似乎证明他非常沉迷于扭曲的超验主义，这与公认的科学方法直接背道而驰。科学，无论怎么重复都不为过，它处理的是有形的现象。科学家就像街上的人一样，必须面对不容忽视的冷静事实，并尽其所能地解释它们。确实，目前科学可能无法回答一些问题，例如 L. Bloom 先生（Pubb. Canv.）提出的第一个问题，涉及未来性别的决定。我们是否必须接受特里纳克里亚的恩培多克勒的观点，即右侧卵巢（月经后时期，其他人断言）负责男性的出生，或者是长期被忽视的精子或质子精子是分化因素，还是像大多数胚胎学家倾向于认为的那样，例如卡尔佩珀、斯帕兰扎尼、布卢门巴赫、拉斯克、赫特维希、利奥波德和瓦伦蒂，是两者的混合体？这相当于一方面是质子植物的形成网与另一方面是被动元素的魅魔之间的合作（大自然最喜欢的手段之一）。同一询问者提出的另一个问题也同样重要：婴儿死亡率。这很有趣，因为正如他中肯地指出的那样，我们都以相同的方式出生，但我们都以不同的方式死亡。 M. Mulligan 先生（Hyg. et Eug. Doc.）将我们的灰肺公民归咎于卫生条件，他们通过吸入潜伏在灰尘中的细菌而感染腺样体、肺部疾病等。 他声称，这些因素，以及我们街道上令人作呕的景象、丑陋的宣传海报、各教派的宗教牧师、残缺不全的士兵和水手、暴露在外的坏血病汽车司机、悬挂的动物尸体、偏执的单身汉和不结果实的杜恩娜——这些，他说，他们对比赛质量的每一次下降负有责任。他预言，卡利佩迪亚很快就会被普遍采用，所有生活的优雅、真正美妙的音乐、令人愉快的文学、轻松的哲学、有启发性的图片、维纳斯和阿波罗等古典雕像的石膏复制品、获奖婴儿的艺术彩色照片，所有这些这些小小的关注将使处于特殊状况的女士们能够以最愉快的方式度过接下来的几个月。 J. Crotthers 先生（Disc. Bacc.）将其中一些死亡归因于女工在车间从事繁重劳动时的腹部创伤以及家庭中的婚姻纪律，但到目前为止，绝大多数是由于私人或官方的疏忽造成的，最终导致新生儿暴露、堕胎罪或残暴的杀婴罪。尽管前者（我们指的是疏忽）无疑是正确的，但他引用的护士忘记计算腹膜腔内海绵数量的案例太罕见，无法成为规范。事实上，当人们仔细研究这一问题时，会惊奇地发现，尽管我们人类的缺点常常阻碍大自然的意图，但考虑到所有因素，如此多的怀孕和分娩都进展顺利。 V. Lynch 先生（Bacc. Arith.）提出了一个巧妙的建议。）出生和死亡，以及所有其他进化现象，潮汐运动，月相，血液温度，一般疾病，一切，总而言之，在大自然的巨大工厂中，从某个遥远的太阳的熄灭到一个太阳的绽放在美化我们公园的无数花朵中，有哪些花朵受制于尚未确定的计数法则。用诗人的话说，为什么父母通常健康、看似健康且得到妥善照顾的孩子会在童年早期莫名其妙地死去（尽管同一婚姻的其他孩子不会），这个简单明了的问题肯定会让我们停下来。我们可以放心，大自然对她所做的一切都有其充分而令人信服的理由，而且这种死亡很可能是由于某种预期法则造成的，根据该法则，病菌已在其中占据了住所（现代科学已经最终表明，只有质质可以说是不朽的）在发育的越来越早的阶段往往会消失，这种安排虽然会给我们的某些情感（尤其是母性）带来痛苦，但我们中的一些人认为，这种安排在从长远来看，有利于整个种族，从而确保适者生存。 S. Dedalus 先生（Div. Scep.）的评论（或者应该称为中断？）杂食性生物能够咀嚼、消化、消化，而且显然能够以极其完美的镇定力通过普通通道，诸如因分娩而消瘦的癌性女性、肥胖的职业绅士等五花八门的食物，更不用说患有黄疸的政客和褪色的修女，可能会发现胃令人震惊的鲍勃的无辜整理中的救济，以一种非常令人厌恶的方式揭示了上面提到的趋势，这是其他任何方法都无法做到的。对于那些不像这位病态的审美家和胚胎哲学家那样熟悉市政屠宰场细节的人的启发，他对科学事物的傲慢自负几乎无法区分酸和碱，并以此为傲，也许应该需要指出的是，在我们下层阶级有执照的粮食供应商的卑鄙用语中，“惊人的鲍勃”意味着刚从母亲那里掉下来的小牛的可烹饪和可食用的肉。最近，在霍勒斯街 29、30 和 31 号国家妇产医院的公共大厅里，与 L. Bloom 先生（Pubb. Canv.）发生了一场公开争论，众所周知，其中 A. Horne 博士（Lic. in Midw.，F.K.Q.C.P.I.）是一位能干且受欢迎的大师，据目击者报道，他曾说过，一旦一个女人把猫放进了袋子里（大概是审美家对最复杂和最奇妙的事物之一的暗示）正如他所说，她必须再次释放它或赋予它生命，以拯救她自己的生命。对话者的反驳是她自己冒着风险，尽管如此，其语气温和而有节制，但效果却很明显。

Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy accouchement. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle. And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!
与此同时，医生的技术和耐心带来了一个幸福的孩子。对于患者和医生来说，这都是一段疲惫不堪的时光。外科手术能做的一切都已经完成了，这位勇敢的女人也勇敢地提供了帮助。她有。她已经打完了那场美好的仗，现在她非常非常幸福。那些已经逝去的人，那些曾经逝去的人，也很高兴，他们低头凝视着这感人的场景，微笑着。虔诚地看着她，她斜倚在那里，眼中闪烁着母亲的光芒，渴望着婴儿的手指（这是一个美丽的景象），在她新母亲的第一次绽放中，呼吸着对天上的无声的感恩祈祷，万能的丈夫。当她慈爱的眼睛注视着她的宝贝时，她只希望再有一个祝福，那就是让她亲爱的多迪和她一起分享她的喜悦，把上帝粘土的小粒放在他的怀里，这是他们合法拥抱的果实。他现在年纪大了（你我可能会窃窃私语），肩膀上有点驼背，但在岁月的流逝中，这位阿尔斯特银行格林学院分行的认真负责的第二会计师却获得了庄严的尊严。哦，多迪，亲爱的老朋友，现在忠实的生活伴侣，也许永远不会再有那个遥远的玫瑰时光了！她回忆起那些日子，美丽的头老摇了几下。上帝！跨越岁月的迷雾，现在多么美丽！但在她的想象中，他们的孩子都在床边，她的和他的，查理、玛丽·爱丽丝、弗雷德里克·阿尔伯特（如果他还活着的话）、妈妈、巴吉（维多利亚·弗朗西斯饰）、汤姆、维奥莱特·康斯坦斯·路易莎、亲爱的小博西（后来的名字）我们南非战争中著名的英雄，沃特福德和坎大哈的鲍勃勋爵），现在这是他们联盟的最后誓言，如果有的话，那就是普尔弗伊人，拥有真正的普尔弗伊鼻子。 年轻的充满希望的人将被命名为莫蒂默·爱德华 (Mortimer Edward)，以纪念都柏林城堡财政部纪念办公室中颇具影响力的普尔弗伊先生的第三代表弟的名字命名。时间就这样流逝着：但克罗尼恩神父在这件事上却很轻率。不，不要让叹息从怀里逸出，亲爱的温柔的米娜。多迪，敲掉你烟斗里的灰烬，当宵禁为你敲响时，你仍然喜欢风干的石南花（愿这是遥远的一天！），并熄灭你在《圣经》中读到的灯光，因为油也已经耗尽了，就这样怀着一颗平静的心去睡觉、去休息。他知道并且会在他自己合适的时候召唤。你也已经打了一场美好的仗，并忠实地扮演了你男人的角色。先生，我的手交给你了。干得好，你这又良善又忠实的仆人！

There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.
有些罪恶或（让我们按照世人的称呼）邪恶的记忆被人隐藏在内心最黑暗的地方，但它们却留在那里等待着。他可能会让他们的记忆变得模糊，让他们就好像他们不存在一样，并且几乎说服自己他们不存在，或者至少不存在。然而，偶然的一句话会突然唤起他们，他们会在各种不同的情况下站起来面对他，无论是异象还是梦境，或者当击鼓和竖琴抚慰他的感官时，或者在凉爽的银色宁静的夜晚或宴会上，半夜时分，此时他已经酒足饭饱了。这景象并不是为了侮辱他，就像是在她的愤怒之下，不是为了报复而把他与生者隔绝，而是笼罩在过去的可怜外衣里，沉默、遥远、责备。

The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a flair, for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTA giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (alles Vergangliche) in her glad look.
陌生人在他面前的脸上仍然看到那里虚假的平静正在缓慢衰退，似乎是习惯或某种精心设计的技巧强加在言语上，言语如此痛苦，以至于指责说话者不健康，天赋，对于更粗鲁的人来说生活的事情。一个场景在观察者的记忆中脱离了自己，似乎是由一个如此自然、朴素的词所唤起的，就好像那些日子真的存在在那里（正如一些人所想的那样）以及它们立即的快乐。五月的一个柔和的夜晚，草坪上的一片剃光的空间，朗德敦的紫丁香树林，紫色和白色，芳香四溢的细长观众观看比赛，但对球体非常感兴趣，因为它们在草地上缓慢地向前奔跑或碰撞并停下来，一个它的同伴，带着短暂的警觉震惊。在那个灰色瓮的那边，水在深思熟虑的灌溉中时不时地流动，你看到另一个芬芳的姐妹情谊，弗洛伊、阿蒂、蒂尼和他们的深色朋友，我不知道当时她的姿势是怎样的，我们的樱桃圣母，一个漂亮的一对从耳朵上垂下来，在凉爽而热情的水果的衬托下，巧妙地衬托出皮肤的异国温暖。一个四五岁的小伙子，穿着亚麻布（盛开的季节，但不久碗就被收集起来并装起来时，仁慈的壁炉里就会欢呼雀跃）站在由那一圈少女般的慈爱之手固定的瓮上。他微微皱起眉头，就像这个年轻人现在所做的那样，他可能过于有意识地享受着危险，但必须要瞥一眼他母亲在广场上看着那朵花的地方，带着淡淡的疏远或责备的阴影（所有的Vergangliche） ）在她高兴的表情中。

Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.
进一步标记并记住。结局来得很突然。走进勤奋好学的人聚集的出生前厅，注意他们的面孔。看起来，没有什么鲁莽或暴力的地方。相反，安静的监护，适合他们在那所房子里的地位，很久以前，牧羊人和天使在犹大的伯利恒的婴儿床周围警惕地看守着。但是，就像闪电之前一样，密集的暴风雨云，由于水分过多，膨胀成团块，在巨大的睡眠中环绕着大地和天空，悬在干涸的田野和昏昏欲睡的牛以及枯萎的灌木和青翠之上，直到刹那间，闪光撕裂了它们的中心，随着雷声的回响，暴雨倾泻出它的洪流，因此，在说出这个词时，转变是猛烈而瞬间的。

Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne’s house has told its tale in that washedout pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?
伯克的！击败我的斯蒂芬勋爵，发出一声叫喊，然后是所有这些人的标签和短尾，公鸡，杰克纳普，威尔士人，药医，准时的布鲁姆高跟鞋，普遍抓住头饰，梣树，比尔博斯，巴拿马帽和刀鞘，采尔马特登山杖和什么不。充满活力的青年，那里的每个学生都是高尚的。走廊里的卡兰护士大吃一惊，也无法阻止他们，也无法阻止微笑着下楼的外科医生报告胎盘终止的消息，如果一毫克，就是整整一磅。他们听他说。门！开放了吗？哈！他们喧闹地出局，准备进行一分钟的比赛，所有人都勇敢地坚持下去，伯克的丹齐尔和霍尔斯是他们的终极目标。迪克森随后对他们说了尖锐的语言，但他也大声宣誓，等等。布卢姆和护士待在一起，想向快乐的母亲和那里的哺乳者说声好话。饮食医生和安静医生。看来她现在也不是别的了？霍恩家里的守卫在那种苍白的颜色中讲述了它的故事。然后一切都消失了，在母亲的帮助下，他瞥了一眼，低声走近：女士，鹳鸟什么时候来找你？

The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny coelum. God’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air. Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man’s work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher’s bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and never—do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathustra? Deine Kuh Trübsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother’s milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the honeymilk of Canaan’s land. Thy cow’s dug was tough, what? Ay, but her milk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this but thick rich bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! Per deam Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum!
外面的空气浸透着雨露的滋润，生命的精华，在星光灿烂的天空下的都柏林石上闪闪发光。上帝的空气，众神之父的空气，闪烁的周围空气。将其深深地吸入你体内。天哪，西奥多·普尔福伊，你做了一件勇敢的事，而且没有任何失误！我发誓，你是这个闲聊中最杰出的祖先，包括最荒唐的编年史。惊人！她身上蕴藏着一种上帝赋予的可能性，你已经通过人类的一点努力而结出硕果。粘住她！服务！继续努力，像一只强盗一样劳作，让学术和所有马尔萨斯主义者都去绞尽脑汁。你就是他们的爸爸，西奥多。艺术在你的重担下下垂，被家里的屠夫账单和账房里的金锭（不是你的！）所困扰？抬起头！你要为每一个新生儿收集你的荷马成熟小麦。看，你的羊毛都湿透了。你羡慕达比·杜尔曼和他的琼吗？松鸦和风眼狗都是它们的后代。噗，我告诉你！他是一头骡子，一头死去的腹足动物，没有活力，也没有耐力，连一个破碎的克鲁兹都不值。没有人口的交配！不，我说！希律王屠杀无辜才是最真实的名字。蔬菜，确实，和无菌同居！给她牛排，红的，生的，流着血的！她是一个白发苍苍的疾病群，腺体肿大，流行性腮腺炎，鸡瘟，拇囊炎，花粉热，褥疮，癣，浮肾，德比夏颈，疣，胆汁发作，胆结石，脚冷，静脉曲张。与 threnes、trentals 和 jeremies 以及所有这些先天性的失效音乐休战吧！二十年了，不后悔。对你来说，这并不像许多人那样愿意、愿意、等待、却从不做。 你看到了你的美国，你的毕生使命，并像跨桥野牛一样冲锋陷阵。查拉图斯特拉怎么说？ Deine Kuh Trübsal melkest Du。 Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters。看！它为你大量爆炸。喝吧，伙计，喝一杯！母乳，普雷福伊，人类亲属的乳汁，头顶上那些在稀薄的雨水蒸气中生长的新兴恒星的乳汁，冲泡奶，就像那些暴徒在他们的暴饮暴食的巢穴中喝下的那样，疯狂的奶，迦南土地的蜜奶。你的牛挖得很艰难，什么？是啊，但是她的牛奶又热又甜，而且让人发胖。没有团块，但厚实丰富的 bonnyclaber。为了她，老族长！爸爸！ Per deam Partulam et Pertundam nunc est bibendum！

* * * * *

The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o’-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fins. Round Rabaiotti’s halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.
夜镇的马博特街入口处，前面是一条没有铺石子的有轨电车，上面有骨架轨道、红色和绿色的鬼火和危险信号。一排排肮脏的房子，门大开。带有淡淡彩虹鳍的稀有灯。拉巴约蒂（Rabaiotti）停止的冰缆车阻碍了男人和女人的争吵。他们抓起晶片，晶片之间夹着珊瑚块和铜雪。吸吮后，它们慢慢散开。孩子们。天鹅座的贡多拉高高举起，在灯塔下的白色和蓝色的黑暗中前进。口哨声呼唤并回应。

THE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I’ll be with you.
电话：等等，亲爱的，我会和你在一起。

THE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable.
答案：在马厩后面。

(A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus’ dance. A chain of children ‘s hands imprisons him.)
（一个戴着护目镜的聋哑白痴，他那不成形的嘴在流着口水，猛地过去，在圣维特的舞蹈中颤抖着。一串孩子的手把他囚禁起来。）

THE CHILDREN: Kithogue! Salute!
孩子们：基索格！礼炮！

THE IDIOT: (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles) Grhahute!
白痴：（举起麻痹的左臂，咯咯地笑）Grhahute！

THE CHILDREN: Where’s the great light?
孩子们：伟大的光在哪里？

THE IDIOT: (Gobbing) Ghaghahest.
白痴：（啜泣）Ghaghahest。

(They release him. He jerks on. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung between two railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat snores, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a comer two night watch in shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey’s voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)
（他们释放了他。他猛地继续。一个侏儒女人在两根栏杆之间挂着的绳子上荡来荡去，一边数着。一个人躺在垃圾箱上，手臂和帽子遮住了声音，打鼾、呻吟、磨牙，然后又打鼾。一个侏儒在垃圾堆中行走，蹲下来扛起一袋破布和骨头。一个老太婆站在一旁，拿着一盏冒烟的油灯，将她的最后一瓶塞进了他的袋子里。他举起他的战利品，拉斜了他的鸭舌帽，然后默默地一瘸一拐地走开了。 ……老太婆摇晃着灯回到了她的巢穴。一个罗圈小孩拿着纸毽子蹲在门阶上，猛地跟在她后面爬行，抓住她的裙子，爬了起来。一个喝醉了的海军用双手抓住了栏杆。一个区域，猛烈地摇晃。在一个角落里，两个戴着肩巾的夜间值班人员，他们的手放在工作人员的皮套上，赫然耸现。盘子摔碎：一个女人尖叫：一个孩子哭泣。一个男人的誓言咆哮，咕哝，停止。人物徘徊，潜伏，来自沃伦斯的观察。在一个房间里，蜡烛插在瓶颈上，一个荡妇正在梳理一个癔病孩子头发上的纹身。西西·卡弗里（Cissy Caffrey）的声音依然年轻，在小巷里尖声歌唱。）

CISSY CAFFREY:
西西·卡弗里：

I gave it to Molly
我把它给了莫莉

Because she was jolly,
因为她心情开朗，

The leg of the duck,
鸭腿，

The leg of the duck.
鸭腿。

(Private Carr and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)
（二等兵卡尔和二等兵康普顿，昂首阔步，摇摇晃晃地右转，从嘴里一起放了一个屁。巷子里传来男人们的笑声。一个声音嘶哑的泼妇反驳道。）

THE VIRAGO: Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
维拉戈：你身上有迹象，毛茸茸的屁股。卡文女孩的力量更大。

CISSY CAFFREY: More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet. (She sings)
西西·卡弗里：对我来说运气更好。卡文 (Cavan)、库特希尔 (Cootehill) 和贝尔图贝特 (Belturbet)。 （她在唱歌）

I gave it to Nelly
我把它给了耐莉

To stick in her belly,
贴在她肚子里，

The leg of the duck,
鸭腿，

The leg of the duck.
鸭腿。

(Private Carr and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond cropped polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)
（二等兵卡尔和二等兵康普顿转身反驳，他们的束腰外衣在灯光下闪闪发亮，金发短款的帽子上戴着黑色的帽子。斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯和林奇穿过人群，靠近红衣。）

PRIVATE COMPTON: (Jerks his finger) Way for the parson.
列兵康普顿：（用手指一抖）请牧师走。

PRIVATE CARR: (Turns and calls) What ho, parson!
私人卡尔：（转身喊道）哎呀，牧师！

CISSY CAFFREY: (Her voice soaring higher)
西西·卡弗里：（她的声音越来越高）

She has it, she got it,
她有，她有，

Wherever she put it,
无论她把它放在哪里，

The leg of the duck.
鸭腿。

(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockeycap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)
（史蒂芬挥舞着左手的梣木，高兴地唱着逾越节的序曲。林奇的骑帽低垂在额头上，注视着他，脸上挂满了不满的冷笑。）

STEPHEN: Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.
史蒂芬：Vidi aquam egrientem de templo a latere dextro。哈利路亚。

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)
（一个老妓女饥饿的断牙从门口伸出来。）

THE BAWD: (Her voice whispering huskily) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst!
混蛋：（她的声音沙哑地低语）嘘！来这里直到我告诉你。梅登黑德里面。嘘！

STEPHEN: (Altius aliquantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit aqua ista.
斯蒂芬：（Altius aliquantulum）Et omnes ad quos pervenit aqua ista。

THE BAWD: (Spits in their trail her jet of venom) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
BAWD：（在他们的踪迹中吐出她的毒液）三一医疗。输卵管。都是混蛋，没有便士。

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with bertha supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)
（伊迪·博德曼抽着鼻子，蹲在贝莎柔顺的身边，用围巾遮住鼻孔。）

EDY BOARDMAN: (Bickering) And says the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That’s not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is! Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and lancecorporal Oliphant.
伊迪·博德曼：（争吵）那个人说：我看到你和你的方推手一起在忠实的地方，铁路上的加油工，戴着他那顶花哨的帽子。你是吗，我说。这不是你该说的，我说。你从来没有见过我和一个已婚的高地人一起陷入陷阱，我说。像她这样的人！那就是雄鹿！顽固得像头骡子！有一次她和两个人一起散步，分别是发动机驾驶员基尔布赖德和一等兵奥利芬特。

STEPHEN: (Ttriumphaliter) Salvi facti sunt.
斯蒂芬：（凯旋）Salvi facti sunt。

(He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scares it with a kick.)
（他挥舞着他的梣木，摇晃着灯的图像，粉碎了整个世界的光芒。一只肝色和白色的西班牙猎犬在他身后徘徊，咆哮着。林奇用脚踢了它。）

LYNCH: So that?
林奇：所以呢？

STEPHEN: (Looks behind) So that gesture, not music not odour, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
史蒂芬：（向后看）因此，手势，而不是音乐，也不是气味，将成为一种通用语言，语言的天赋使可见的不是外行的感觉，而是第一个隐得莱希，即结构节奏。

LYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street!
林奇：色情哲学神学。梅克伦堡街的形而上学！

STEPHEN: We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.
史蒂芬：我们有精明的莎士比亚和怕老婆的苏格拉底。即使是最聪明的鹿蹄石也会被爱之光咬住、勒住、骑上。

LYNCH: Ba!
林奇：呸！

STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar. Hold my stick.
斯蒂芬：无论如何，谁想要两个手势来说明一条面包和一个水罐呢？这个乐章描绘了奥马尔的一条面包和一罐面包或酒。握住我的棍子。

LYNCH: Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
林奇：该死的你的黄棍子。我们去哪？

STEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam.
史蒂芬：好色的山猫，致无情的美女乔治娜·约翰逊，我爱你。

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)
（史蒂芬把梣木推到他身上，慢慢地伸出双手，头向后仰，直到双手距离胸部一跨，向下转动，在平面上相交，手指即将分开，左手较高。）

LYNCH: Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
林奇：哪一壶面包是哪一壶？技能不行。那个或者海关。给你说明一下。在这里，拄着拐杖走路。

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.
（他们过去了。汤米·卡弗里爬到煤气灯前，紧握着，痉挛地攀爬。他从顶部的支线滑下来。杰基·卡弗里抓住煤气灯攀爬。水手​​们靠着灯摇摇晃晃。双胞胎在黑暗中迅速逃走。水手们，他摇摇晃晃，用食指抵住鼻翼，从较远的鼻孔喷出一股长长的鼻涕。他扛着油灯，摇摇晃晃地穿过人群，闪着火光。

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy, staggering forward, cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding on the farther side under the railway bridge bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a sidepocket. From Gillen’s hairdresser’s window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson’s image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. he passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.
河雾蜿蜒缓慢地蠕动。从排水沟、裂缝、污水坑、垃圾堆里，四面八方都散发着停滞的烟雾。一道光芒在南方跃过河流入海的河段。水手们摇摇晃晃地向前走，挤开人群，摇摇晃晃地走向铁路桥下另一侧的有轨电车，布卢姆出现了，脸涨得通红，气喘吁吁，把面包和巧克力塞进了侧袋。吉伦理发店的橱窗里，一幅合成肖像展示了他英勇的纳尔逊形象。旁边的一面凹面镜子向他展示了失恋已久的lugubru Booloohoom。格雷夫·格莱斯顿看到他很平静，布鲁姆对布鲁姆。他经过时，被威灵顿好斗的目光所震惊，但在凸面镜中，他的笑容却没有击中乔利波尔迪的博纳姆眼睛和厚脸颊脸颊。

At Antonio Pabaiotti’s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamp. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)
在安东尼奥·帕拜奥蒂家门口，布卢姆停了下来，在明亮的弧光灯下流汗了。他消失了。过了一会儿，他又出现了，然后又快步走了。）

BLOOM: Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
布卢姆：鱼和土豆泥。 NG。啊!

(He disappears into Olhausen’s, the porkbutcher’s, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig’s crubeen, the other a cold sheep’s trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs and groans.)
（他消失在奥尔豪森的猪肉屠夫店里，在即将落下的卷帘门下。过了一会儿，他从百叶窗下出来，吸着波迪，吹着布卢胡姆。他两只手里拿着一个包裹，一个装着一个不冷不热的猪油，另一个装着冷的猪油。撒上全胡椒的羊蹄。他直直地站着，喘着粗气。然后弯下腰，把一个包裹压在肋骨上，发出呻吟声。）

BLOOM: Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
布鲁姆：缝在我身边。我为什么跑？

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)
（他小心翼翼地吸了一口气，慢慢地朝灯组的壁板走去。光芒再次跳跃。）

BLOOM: What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
布鲁姆：那是什么？闪光器？探照灯。

(He stands at Cormack’s corner, watching)
（他站在科马克的角落里，看着）

BLOOM: Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar’s bush. We’re safe. (He hums cheerfully) London’s burning, London’s burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street) I’ll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.
BLOOM：北极光还是钢铁铸造厂？啊，当然是大队了。无论如何，南边。大火。可能是他家。乞丐的灌木丛。我们很安全。 （他高兴地哼哼）伦敦在燃烧，伦敦在燃烧！着火了，着火了！ （他看到塔尔博特街另一边的海军士兵摇摇晃晃地穿过人群）我会想念他的。跑步。快的。最好在这里穿越。

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)
（他飞快地过马路。顽童大喊。）

THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling)
海胆们：小心点，先生！ （两个骑自行车的人，提着点燃的纸灯笼，从他身边游过，擦过他，铃铛叮当作响）

THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.
钟声：哈蒂蒂蒂蒂。

BLOOM: (Halts erect, stung by a spasm) Ow!
布卢姆：（猛地站了起来，一阵痉挛）噢！

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)
（他环顾四周，突然向前冲去。透过升起的雾气，一条撒沙龙小心翼翼地向他猛冲过来，巨大的红色车头灯闪烁着，电车在电线上发出嘶嘶声。司机敲响了脚锣。）

THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
锣：Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo。

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman’s whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged out of the track. The motorman, thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)
（刹车猛烈地响了。布卢姆举起警察戴着白手套的手，双腿僵直，踉踉跄跄地冲出了轨道。司机向前冲，在导向轮上打了个嗝，一边从链条和钥匙上滑过，一边大喊。）

THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?
司机：嘿，狗屎们，你们在上演帽子戏法吗？

BLOOM: (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow’s exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket) Poor mamma’s panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard’s corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
布卢姆：（布卢姆跳到路边石上，又停了下来。他用手掌拍掉脸颊上的泥片。）没有大道。仔细剃掉但治愈了缝合。必须再次进行桑多的练习。双手放下。还要确保避免街头事故。天意。 （他摸了摸裤兜）可怜的妈妈的灵丹妙药。鞋跟很容易卡在轨道上或鞋带卡在齿轮上。有一天，在伦纳德的拐角处，黑色玛丽亚的车轮把我的鞋子剥落了。第三次就是魅力。鞋子技巧。无礼的司机。我应该举报他。紧张使他们紧张。可能是今天早上那个家伙阻止我和那个骑马的女人在一起。一样的美感风格。他还是很快。走路僵硬。开玩笑中说出的真话。拉德巷那可怕的痉挛。我吃了有毒的东西幸运的象征。为什么？可能是丢了牛。野兽印记。 （他立刻闭上眼睛）脑袋里有一点光亮。每月或效果另计。脑筋急转弯。那种疲惫的感觉。现在对我来说太多了。噢！

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against o’beirne’s wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)
（一个邪恶的人物用辫子腿靠在奥贝恩的墙上，面容不明，注射了黑色水银。从一顶宽叶阔边帽下，这个人物用邪恶的眼神看着他。）

BLOOM: Buenas noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?
布卢姆：Buenas noches，小姐布兰卡，que calle es esta？

THE FIGURE: (Impassive, raises a signal arm) Password. Sraid Mabbot.
人物：（面无表情，举起信号臂）密码。斯雷德·马博特。

BLOOM: Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.
布鲁姆：哈哈。谢谢。世界语。斯兰皮革。 （他嘀咕道）盖尔联盟的间谍，是那个食火者派来的。

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)
（他向前走去。一个背着麻袋的破布人挡住了他的路。他向左走，破布人向左走。）

BLOOM: I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on.)
布鲁姆：我求你了。 （他突然转向，侧向，退到一边，溜过去，然后继续前行。）

BLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a signpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
布鲁姆：靠右行驶，向右，向右。如果旅游俱乐部在 Stepaside 设立了一个路标，是谁获得了公共利益呢？我迷失了方向，为《爱尔兰自行车手》专栏撰稿，这封信的标题是《在最黑暗的步道》。保持，保持，保持在右边。午夜时分，衣衫褴褛。更有可能是栅栏。凶手获得第一名。洗净他世间的罪孽。

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)
（汤米·卡弗里追捕的杰克·卡弗里全力对抗布鲁姆。）

BLOOM: O
布卢姆：哦

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepoket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)
（他吃了一惊，火腿很软，停了下来。汤米和杰基消失在那里，消失在那里。布卢姆用包裹着的手拍拍手表口袋，书袋，钱包，罪恶的糖果，土豆肥皂。）

BLOOM: Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves’ dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.
布鲁姆：小心扒手。老盗贼的闪避。碰撞。然后抢走你的钱包。

(The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)
（猎犬走近，嗅着，鼻子贴在地上。一个四肢伸开的人打了个喷嚏。一个弯腰、留着胡须的人物出现，穿着锡安一位长老的长袍，戴着带有洋红色流苏的吸烟帽。有角的眼镜垂在鼻翼上。黄色画出的脸上有毒痕。）

RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So you catch no money.
鲁道夫：今天第二个半冠浪费了钱。我告诉过你永远不要和醉酒的异教徒一起去。所以你赚不到钱。

BLOOM: (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.
布卢姆：（把克鲁宾和猪蹄藏在背后，垂头丧气地摸着温暖和寒冷的脚肉）Ja，ich weiss，papachi。

RUDOLPH: What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (with feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?
鲁道夫：你对这个地方做了什么？你没有灵魂吗？ （他用虚弱的秃鹰爪子摸着布鲁姆沉默的脸）你不是我的儿子利奥波德，利奥波德的孙子吗？你不是我亲爱的儿子利奥波德吗？他离开了他父亲的家，离开了他祖先亚伯拉罕和雅各的神？

BLOOM: (With precaution) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that’s left of him.
布卢姆：（谨慎地）我想是的，父亲。莫森塔尔。他仅剩的一切。

RUDOLPH: (Severely) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
鲁道夫：（严厉地）有一天晚上，他们花光了你的钱，把你喝醉了，像狗一样带回家。你怎么称呼他们跑步的家伙？

BLOOM: (In youth’s smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent’s sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud) Harriers, father. Only that once.
布卢姆：（年轻人穿着漂亮的蓝色牛津西装，搭配白色背心，窄肩，戴着棕色阿尔卑斯帽，戴着男士纯银沃特伯里无钥匙手表，戴着双路边阿尔伯特，上面贴着封条，一侧涂满了硬化泥）鹞，父亲。仅此一次。

RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
鲁道夫：一次！从头到脚都是泥。把你的手切开。牙关紧闭。他们让你崩溃了，Leopoldleben。你看着他们。

BLOOM: (Weakly) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.
布卢姆：（虚弱地）他们向我发起冲刺挑战。泥泞不堪。我滑倒了。

RUDOLPH: (With contempt) Goim nachez! Nice spectacles for your poor mother!
鲁道夫：（轻蔑地）Goim nachez！给你可怜的妈妈配一副漂亮的眼镜吧！

BLOOM: Mamma!
布鲁姆：妈妈！

ELLEN BLOOM: (In pantomime dame’s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey’s crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand, and cries out in shrill alarm) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all at all?
埃伦·布鲁姆：（身着哑剧贵妇的串绳帽，寡妇特万基的衬裙和裙撑，羊腿袖上衣，后面扣着纽扣，灰色的手套和浮雕胸针，她编成辫子的头发用松脆的网罩着，出现在楼梯栏杆上，手里拿着一个倾斜的烛台，并尖声惊恐地喊叫）神圣的救赎主啊，他们对他做了什么！我的嗅盐！ （她拖起一条裙子，翻遍了她的条纹花呢衬裙的小袋。一个小瓶子、一个阿格努斯·德伊、一个干瘪的土豆和一个赛璐珞娃娃掉了出来）圣母玛利亚圣心，你究竟在哪里？

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)
（布卢姆低垂着眼睛，咕哝着，开始把他的包裹塞进装满的口袋里，但又停下来，嘟哝着。）

A VOICE: (Sharply) Poldy!
一个声音：（尖锐地）波尔迪！

BLOOM: Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily) At your service.
布鲁姆：谁？ （他笨拙地躲开一击）听候您的吩咐。

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)
（他抬起头来。在她海枣树的海市蜃楼旁边，一位身着土耳其服装的英俊女子站在他面前。她猩红色的裤子和夹克上有华丽的曲线，上面有金色的开叉。一条宽大的黄色腰带围着她。白色的yashmak，在夜色中呈紫罗兰色，遮住她的脸，只留下她那双黑色的大眼睛和乌黑的头发。）

BLOOM: Molly!
布鲁姆：莫莉！

MARION: Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
玛丽恩：嗯？马里恩夫人，亲爱的，当你跟我说话的时候。 （讽刺）可怜的小老公已经等了这么久了吗？

BLOOM: (Shifts from foot to foot) No, no. Not the least little bit.
布卢姆：（从一只脚换到另一只脚）不，不。一点也不。

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
（他深深地激动地呼吸，吞咽了一大口空气，问题，希望，为她准备晚餐的克鲁宾，要告诉她的事情，借口，欲望，着迷。一枚硬币在她的额头上闪闪发光。她的脚上有镶满宝石的脚趾。她的脚踝相连一条细长的脚镣拴住了她。在她旁边，有一头戴着角塔头巾的骆驼正在等待。无数横档的丝梯爬上他那摇晃的豪达。他带着不满的后躯慢慢走近。她猛烈地拍打他的臀部，她的金色手镯愤怒地责骂着他摩尔语。）

MARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!
玛丽恩：内布拉卡达！女性化！

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
（骆驼举起前腿，从树上摘下一颗大芒果，用分蹄眨着眼，献给情妇，然后低下头，仰起脖子，笨手笨脚地跪下。布卢姆弯下腰。用于蛙跳。）

BLOOM: I can give you … I mean as your business menagerer … Mrs Marion … if you …
布卢姆：我可以给你……我的意思是作为你的业务经理……马里恩夫人……如果你……

MARION: So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.
玛丽昂：所以你注意到一些变化了吗？ （她的手慢慢地抚过她的小饰物肚兜，眼里慢慢地流露出友善的嘲讽）噢，波尔迪，波尔迪，你真是个可怜的老棍子！去看看生活吧。看到广阔的世界。

BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets) This moving kidney. Ah!
布卢姆：我正要回去买白蜡乳液、橙花水。周四商店关门较早。但早上第一件事。 （他拍拍潜水员的口袋）这个移动的肾脏。啊!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)
（他指着南方，然后指着东方。一块新的干净的柠檬皂饼升起，散发着光芒和香味。）

THE SOAP:
肥皂：

We’re a capital couple are Bloom and I.
布鲁姆和我是一对绝配。

He brightens the earth. I polish the sky.
他照亮了大地。我擦亮天空。

(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
（药剂师斯温尼的雀斑脸出现在肥皂太阳的光盘中。）

SWENY: Three and a penny, please.
SWENY：请给我三分一便士。

BLOOM: Yes. For my wife. Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
布鲁姆：是的。为了我的妻子。马里恩夫人。特别食谱。

MARION: (Softly) Poldy!
玛丽恩：（轻声地）波尔迪！

BLOOM: Yes, ma’am?
布鲁姆：是吗，女士？

MARION: ti trema un poco il cuore?
玛丽恩：你有什么心吗？

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni.)
（她轻蔑地慢步走开，胖乎乎的像一只被养尊处优的噘嘴鸽子，嘴里哼着《唐璜》的二重唱。）

BLOOM: Are you sure about that voglio? I mean the pronunciati …
布鲁姆：你确定那个voglio吗？我的意思是发音...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)
（他跟在后面，嗅梗犬也跟在后面。老妓女抓住他的袖子，下巴痣的鬃毛闪闪发光。）

THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There’s no-one in it only her old father that’s dead drunk.
妓女：处女十先令。新鲜的东西从来没有被碰过。十五。里面没有人，只有她喝得烂醉的老父亲。

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie Kelly stands.)
（她指着。布莱迪·凯利站在她阴暗的、被雨淋湿的、鬼鬼祟祟的书房的缝隙里。）

BRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
布里迪：哈奇街。你心里有什么好处吗？

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)
（她吱吱地拍打蝙蝠披肩，拔腿就跑。一个粗壮的粗汉穿着靴子大步追赶。他在台阶上绊倒，恢复过来，陷入阴暗之中。听见微弱的笑声，越来越弱。）

THE BAWD: (Her wolfeyes shining) He’s getting his pleasure. You won’t get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don’t be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
妓女：（她的狼眼闪闪发光）他正在得到他的快乐。在闪光屋里你不会得到处女。十先令。不要整晚都在便衣城邦看到我们之前。六十七是个贱人。

(Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind, ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)
（格蒂·麦克道威尔斜视着，一瘸一拐地向前走。她从后面退了一步，瞪着眼睛，害羞地展示了她沾满血的影响力。）

GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs) You did that. I hate you.
格蒂：带着我所有的世俗财产，我和你。 （她低声说）你做到了。我恨你。

BLOOM: I? When? You’re dreaming. I never saw you.
布鲁姆：我？什么时候？你在做梦。我从来没有见过你。

THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
妓女：别打扰这位先生，你是骗子。写君子假信。街头游街、拉客。你妈妈最好把带子放在床柱上给你，像你这样的女人。

GERTY: (To Bloom) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.
格蒂：（对布鲁姆）当你看到我最下面抽屉里的所有秘密时。 （她抓着他的袖子，流着口水）肮脏的已婚男人！我爱你对我这么做。

(She glides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man’s frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
（她歪歪扭扭地溜走了。布林太太穿着男式带饰边大衣，口袋宽松，站在堤道上，她那双顽皮的眼睛睁得大大的，食草的龅牙微笑着。）

MRS BREEN: Mr …
布林夫人：……先生……

BLOOM: (Coughs gravely) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant …
布卢姆：（严重咳嗽）女士，当我们上次在十六号的信中获得这种快乐时……

MRS BREEN: Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!
布林夫人：布卢姆先生！你在罪恶的巢穴里！我很好地抓住了你！恶棍！

BLOOM: (Hurriedly) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me? Don’t give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It’s ages since I. You’re looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary …
布卢姆：（急忙）我的名字没那么大声。你觉得我怎么样？别把我出卖。隔墙有耳。你好吗？距离我已经好久了。你看上去棒极了。绝对是它。每年的这个时候，我们的天气都是季节性的。黑色折射热量。这里是回家的捷径。有趣的季度。营救倒下的妇女。玛格达琳庇护所。我是秘书……

MRS BREEN: (Holds up a finger) Now, don’t tell a big fib! I know somebody won’t like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily) Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!
布林夫人：（举起一根手指）现在，别撒谎了！我知道有人不会喜欢这样。噢，等我见到莫莉吧！ （狡猾地）这一刻你自己负责吧，不然你就有祸了！

BLOOM: (Looks behind) She often said she’d like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
布鲁姆：（向后看）她经常说她想去看看。贫民窟。异国情调，你看。如果她有钱的话，也会有穿制服的黑人仆人。奥赛罗黑畜生。尤金·斯特拉顿.甚至是利弗莫尔克里斯蒂的骨头和角卫。宝熙兄弟。就此事扫一扫。

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes, leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
（汤姆和山姆·博希，穿着白色鸭绒服、猩红色袜子、戴着上等淀粉的桑博项圈、纽扣孔里插着大猩红色紫苑的彩色浣熊，跳了出来。每个人都挂着班卓琴。他们苍白的小黑人手使双绞线叮当作响。卡菲尔的白色眼睛闪闪发亮。它们的獠牙在笨拙的木屐中嘎嘎作响，扭动着，唱着歌，背对背，脚趾脚跟，脚跟脚趾，黑鬼的嘴唇噼啪作响。）

TOM AND SAM:
汤姆和萨姆：

There’s someone in the house with Dina
房子里有人和迪娜在一起

There’s someone in the house, I know,
我知道家里有人

There’s someone in the house with Dina
房子里有人和迪娜在一起

Playing on the old banjo.
在旧班卓琴上演奏。

(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
（他们从原始的婴儿脸上摘下黑色面具：然后，咯咯地笑着，咯咯地笑，哼着音乐，弹着琴弦，骗着骗着，轻轻松松地跳舞走了。）

BLOOM: (With a sour tenderish smile) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
布卢姆：（带着酸涩而温柔的微笑）有点轻浮，可以吗，如果你愿意的话？你愿意我拥抱你一瞬间吗？

MRS BREEN: (Screams gaily) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
布林夫人：（高兴地尖叫）哦，你这个混蛋！你应该看看你自己！

BLOOM: For old sake’ sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily) ‘Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
布鲁姆：看在老份上。我只是指一场方方正正的聚会，一场由我们不同的小夫妻组成的混合婚姻。你知道我对你有一个温柔的角落。 （阴沉地）‘我给你寄了那张亲爱的瞪羚的情人节礼物。

MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there’s a dear.
布林夫人：天哪，爱丽丝，你看起来真是一场神圣的表演！杀戮简单。 （她好奇地伸出手）你背后藏着什么？告诉我们，有一个亲爱的。

BLOOM: (Seizes her wrist with his free hand) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina Simpson’s housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuffbox?
布卢姆：（用空着的那只手抓住她的手腕）乔西·鲍威尔，她是都柏林最漂亮的黛布。时间过得真快啊！你还记得吗，回顾一下过去的圣诞节之夜，乔治娜·辛普森在乔吉娜·辛普森的乔迁典礼上，他们正在玩欧文·毕夏普游戏，蒙着眼睛找到别针并读心术？题主，这个鼻烟壶里装的是什么？

MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.
布林夫人：你那严肃而喜剧的朗诵让你成为了夜晚的狮子，你看起来也很符合这个角色。你一直是女士们的最爱。

BLOOM: (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
布卢姆：（贵妇侍从，穿着水丝饰面晚礼服，纽扣孔上有蓝色共济会徽章，黑色蝴蝶结和珍珠母耳钉，手中倾斜着棱柱形香槟酒杯）女士们先生们，我给你们爱尔兰，家和美丽。

MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall. Love’s old sweet song.
布林夫人：那些无法回忆的亲爱的死去的日子。爱情的古老甜蜜歌曲。

BLOOM: (Meaningfully dropping his voice) I confess I’m teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person’s something is a little teapot at present.
布卢姆：（故意压低声音）我承认我是一个茶壶，好奇心想知道某人的东西目前是否是一个小茶壶。

MRS BREEN: (Gushingly) Tremendously teapot! London’s teapot and I’m simply teapot all over me! (She rubs sides with him) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
布林夫人：（滔滔不绝地）好极了的茶壶！伦敦的茶壶，而我就是我身上的茶壶！ （她与他擦肩而过）玩完客厅神秘游戏和树上的饼干后，我们坐在楼梯脚凳上。槲寄生下。二是公司。

BLOOM: (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring) Là ci darem la mano.
布卢姆：（戴着一顶带有琥珀色半月形的紫色拿破仑帽，他的手指和拇指慢慢地滑过她柔软湿润、肉质的手掌，她轻轻地交出）夜晚的魔幻时刻。我小心地、缓慢地从这只手上取出碎片。 （温柔地，他将红宝石戒指戴在她的手指上）Là cidarem la mano。

MRS BREEN: (In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph’s diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly) Voglio e non. You’re hot! You’re scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.
布林夫人：（穿着一件月光蓝色的连体晚礼服，额头上戴着一顶金属丝精灵王冠，她的舞卡落在她的月蓝色缎面拖鞋旁边，轻轻地弯曲她的手掌，呼吸急促）Voglio e non。你很热！你烫伤了！左手距离心脏最近。

BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely) Woman, it’s breaking me!
布鲁姆：当你做出现在的选择时，他们说这是美女与野兽。我永远无法原谅你。 （他的拳头紧握在额头上）想想这意味着什么。那时你对我来说意味着一切。 （沙哑地）女人，这让我心碎！

(Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely’s sandwichboards, shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)
（丹尼斯·布林，戴着白色高帽，穿着威斯德姆·海利的三明治板，穿着地毯拖鞋拖​​着脚步从他们身边走过，暗淡的胡须伸出来，左右呢喃着。小阿尔夫·伯根，披着黑桃A的外衣，跟着他左右摇摆，笑声加倍。）

ALF BERGAN: (Points jeering at the sandwichboards) U. p: Up.
ALF BERGAN：（指着三明治板嘲笑） U.p：上。

MRS BREEN: (To Bloom) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye) Why didn’t you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.
布林夫人：（对布卢姆）楼梯下玩得很嗨。 （她高兴地看着他）你为什么不亲吻那个地方让它好起来？你想要的。

BLOOM: (Shocked) Molly’s best friend! Could you?
布卢姆：（震惊）莫莉最好的朋友！您可以...吗？

MRS BREEN: (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
布林夫人：（她的肉质舌头在嘴唇之间，做出了鸽子般的吻）嗯。答案是柠檬。你那里有给我的小礼物吗？

BLOOM: (Offhandedly) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pigs’ feet. Feel.
布鲁姆：（随口地）犹太洁食。晚餐的点心。没有盆栽肉的家是不完整的。我当时在莉亚。班德曼·帕尔默夫人。莎士比亚的杰出代表。不幸的是扔掉了该程序。那里是吃猪脚的好地方。感觉。

(Richie Goulding, three ladies’ hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He opens it and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)
（里奇·古尔丁头上别着三顶女士帽子，一侧被科利斯和沃德的黑色法律袋子压着，袋子上用白色石灰水画了骷髅和交叉骨。他打开袋子，展示了里面装满了腌制的波洛尼。鲱鱼、Findon haddies 和紧密包装的药丸。）

RICHIE: Best value in Dub.
RICHIE：配音中最有价值的。

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
（秃头帕特，烦恼的甲虫，站在路边石上，叠好餐巾，等待着。）

PAT: (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
帕特：（端着一盘溢出的肉汁的倾斜盘子前进）牛排和腰子。一瓶啤酒。嘻嘻嘻。等我等一下。

RICHIE: Goodgod. Inev erate inall …
里奇：天哪。总而言之……

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
（他低着头，顽强地向前行进。水手们摇摇晃晃地走过，用燃烧的叉角羚抵住了他。）

RICHIE: (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright’s! Lights!
里奇：（痛苦地叫了一声，把手放在背上）啊！光明的！灯！

BLOOM: (Ooints to the navvy) A spy. Don’t attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
布卢姆：（指着海军）一名间谍。不要引起注意。我讨厌愚蠢的人群。我不喜欢享乐。我正处于严重的困境之中。

MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
布林夫人：像往常一样用你的公鸡和公牛的故事来欺骗和胡言乱语。

BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.
布鲁姆：我想告诉你一个关于我是如何来到这里的小秘密。但你绝对不能说出来。连莫莉也不行。我有一个最特别的理由。

MRS BREEN: (All agog) O, not for worlds.
布林夫人：（热切地）哦，不，不。

BLOOM: Let’s walk on. Shall us?
布鲁姆：我们继续走吧。我们可以吗？

MRS BREEN: Let’s.
布林夫人： 咱们吧。

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)
（妓女做了一个无人理睬的手势。布卢姆和布林太太一起继续前行。梗犬摇着尾巴跟在后面，可怜兮兮地哀鸣着。）

THE BAWD: Jewman’s melt!
BAWD：犹太人融化了！

BLOOM: (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd’s plaid Saint Andrew’s cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
布卢姆：（身着燕麦色运动套装，翻领上别着一枝苦藤，托尼浅黄色衬衫，牧羊人格子圣安德鲁十字围巾，白色口角鞋，手臂上穿着浅黄褐色风衣，黄褐色布洛克鞋，弹带上戴着望远镜，戴着一顶灰色斗鸡帽）你还记得很久很久以前，我们叫她木偶米莉断奶后，我们一起去参加童话屋比赛，是吗？

MRS BREEN: (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil) Leopardstown.
布林太太：（穿着漂亮的萨克斯定制服装，戴着白色丝绒帽子和蜘蛛面纱）豹子镇。

BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose …
布鲁姆：我是说，Leopardstown。莫莉赢得了七先令的三岁马，名叫内特尔（Nevertell），和福克斯罗克（Foxrock）一起回家，开着那辆旧的五座山德拉丹马车回家，那时你正处于鼎盛时期，你戴着海耶斯太太那顶新的白色丝绒帽子，周围有鼹鼠毛。建议你买，因为它的标价是十九和十一，一点金属丝和一块旧的棉绒抹布，我会给你你喜欢的东西，她是故意的……

MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don’t tell me! Nice adviser!
布林夫人：当然，她做了那只猫！别告诉我！好顾问！

BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
布卢姆：因为它并不像另一件我很欣赏你穿的那顶带有天堂鸟翅膀的小鸭子小塔米无边帽那样适合你，老实说，你穿上它看起来太迷人了，虽然杀掉它很可惜你这个残忍顽皮的生物，一个心有句号那么大的小东西。

MRS BREEN: (Squeezes his arm, simpers) Naughty cruel I was!
布林夫人：（握紧手臂，傻笑）我真是顽皮残忍！

BLOOM: (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was …
布卢姆：（低声、秘密地、更快地）莫莉正在吃乔·加拉赫夫人的午餐篮里的五香牛肉三明治。坦率地说，尽管她有顾问或仰慕者，但我从来不太关心她的风格。她 …

MRS BREEN: Too …
布林夫人：太……

BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across …
布鲁姆：是的。莫莉笑了，因为当我们路过一座农舍时，罗杰斯和马格特·奥莱利正在模仿一只公鸡，茶商马库斯·特蒂乌斯·摩西和他的女儿开着一辆演出车从我们身边驶过，她的名字叫舞者摩西，她身上有一只贵宾犬。你问我是否听过、读过、知道或遇到过……

MRS BREEN: (Eagerly) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
布林夫人：（热切地）是的，是的，是的，是的，是的，是的，是的。

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
（她从他身边消失。跟着那只哀嚎的狗，他朝地狱之门走去。拱门里，一个站着的女人，向前弯着身子，双脚分开，胆怯地小便。在一家关着门的酒吧外，一群游荡者听着他们用断鼻子讲的故事。灯光师粗声粗气地幽默地说。一对无臂的两人在摔跤中咆哮着，在一场伤痕累累、浑身湿透的打斗中。）

THE GAFFER: (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan’s plasterers.
灯光师：（蹲下身子，鼻子里的声音扭曲）当凯恩斯从海狸街的脚手架上下来时，他只是把它放进了等待德万抹灰工刨花的搬运工桶里。

THE LOITERERS: (Guffaw with cleft palates) O jays!
游荡者：（腭裂狂笑）松鸦啊！

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
（他们带着油漆斑点的帽子摇晃着。他们的小屋里溅满了尺寸和石灰，他们四肢无力地在他身边跳来跳去。）

BLOOM: Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
布鲁姆：也是巧合。他们认为这很有趣。除了那个之外什么都可以。光天化日。试着走路。幸好没有女人。

THE LOITERERS: Jays, that’s a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men’s porter.
闲逛者：杰斯，那是一件好事。芒硝。哦，松鸦们，进入男士搬运工吧。

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)
（布卢姆走过。廉价的妓女，单身的，成双成对的，披着披肩的，头发蓬乱的，从巷子里、门口、角落里呼唤着。）

THE WHORES:
妓女：

Are you going far, queer fellow?
你要去远方吗，奇怪的家伙？

How’s your middle leg?
你的中腿怎么样？

Got a match on you?
你有比赛吗？

Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
呃，到这里来，等我把它变硬为止。

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)
（他艰难地穿过污水坑，朝远处灯火通明的街道走去。从凸出的窗帘中，一台留声机抬起了一个破旧的黄铜箱子。在阴影中，一个女佣人正在与水手和两个红衣人讨价还价。）

THE NAVVY: (Belching) Where’s the bloody house?
海军：（打嗝）那该死的房子在哪儿？

THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.
舍宾基珀：普登街。先令一瓶黑啤酒。值得尊敬的女人。

THE NAVVY: (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them) Come on, you British army!
海军：（抓住两个英国士兵，和他们一起摇摇晃晃地向前走）来吧，你们英国军队！

PRIVATE CARR: (Behind his back) He aint half balmy.
列兵卡尔：（在他背后）他一点也不温和。

PRIVATE COMPTON: (Laughs) What ho!
列兵康普顿：（笑）什么嗬！

PRIVATE CARR: (To the navvy) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.
列兵：（对海军）波托贝洛军营食堂。你去找卡尔。只是卡尔。

THE NAVVY: (Shouts)
海军：（喊叫）

We are the boys. Of Wexford.
我们是男孩。韦克斯福德的。

PRIVATE COMPTON: Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
康普顿列兵：说！军士长什么价？

PRIVATE CARR: Bennett? He’s my pal. I love old Bennett.
二等兵卡尔：贝内特？他是我的朋友。我爱老贝内特。

THE NAVVY: (Shouts)
海军：（喊叫）

The galling chain.
令人毛骨悚然的链条。

And free our native land.
并解放我们的祖国。

(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting)
（他踉踉跄跄地向前走去，拖着它们。布卢姆错误地停了下来。狗靠近了，伸出舌头，气喘吁吁）

BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he’s the best of that lot. If I hadn’t heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn’t have gone and wouldn’t have met. Kismet. He’ll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can’t always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock’s window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.
布鲁姆：野鹅追这个。房屋杂乱。天知道他们去了哪里。醉酒者以双倍的速度移动距离。很好的混合。韦斯特兰排的场景。然后用第三张票跳上头等舱。然后就太远了。火车发动机在后面。可能会带我去马拉海德或支线过夜或发生碰撞。第二杯就可以了。一次就是一个剂量。我跟着他干什么？尽管如此，他仍然是这群人中最好的。如果我没有听说过博福伊·普尔福伊夫人，我就不会去，也不会见面。天运。他会失去这笔现金。在这里缓解办公室。对于小气鬼和器官来说是个好生意。你们还缺什么？来得快，去得也快。仅仅为了保持头脑清醒，我也可能会因为那辆曼工轮轨道手推车眩光主宰而失去生命。但并不总是能拯救你。如果那天我两分钟后经过特鲁洛克的窗户，就会被枪杀。身体缺席。不过，如果子弹只穿过我的外套，我会受到电击伤害，五百英镑。他是什么？基尔代尔街头俱乐部的老板们。愿上帝帮助他的猎场看守。

(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What’s that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)
（他凝视前方，读着墙上潦草的粉笔传奇湿梦和阳具图案。） 奇怪！莫莉在金斯敦的磨砂车窗玻璃上画画。那是什么样子的？ （艳丽的娃娃女人懒洋洋地躺在灯火通明的门口、窗子里，抽着鸟眼香烟。令人作呕的甜草的气味在缓慢的椭圆形花环中向他飘来。）

THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
花环：糖果很甜。罪恶的糖果。

BLOOM: My spine’s a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son gout. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher’s tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
布鲁姆：我的脊椎有点软。走还是转？还有这个食物？吃掉它，变得粘猪一样。我真是荒谬。浪费钱。一又八便士太多了。 （猎犬用冰冷、流鼻涕的口吻抵住他的手，摇着尾巴。） 奇怪他们对我的态度如何。即使是今天那个野蛮人。最好先跟他谈谈。像女人一样，他们喜欢相遇。臭得像鸡貂。查存儿子痛风。他可能生气了。三伏天。他的动作有些不确定。好人！菲多！好人！加里欧文！ （狼狗仰面躺着，用爪子猥亵地蠕动，伸出黑色的长舌头。） 周围环境的影响。给予并完成它。没有人提供。 （他一边喊着鼓励的话，一边偷偷摸摸地迈着偷猎者的脚步，踉踉跄跄地回来，被塞猎手逼进了一个黑暗的死角。他展开一个包裹，轻轻地倒掉了克鲁宾，但又忍住了，摸了摸猪蹄。）价值三便士。但后来我把它拿在了我的左手上。需要付出更多的努力。为什么？由于不需要使用而变小。哦，让它滑动。两个和六个。

(With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)
（他遗憾地让展开的红毛驴和猪蹄滑落。獒犬笨拙地撕扯着包裹，用咆哮的贪婪吃饱了自己，把骨头嚼得嘎吱作响。两个披着雨衣的守望者走近，沉默而警惕。他们一起低声呢喃。）

THE WATCH: Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
手表：绽放。布鲁姆的。为了布鲁姆。盛开。

(Each lays hand on Bloom’s shoulder.)
（两人把手放在布鲁姆的肩膀上。）

FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
第一眼：当场被捕。不要造成滋扰。

BLOOM: (Stammers) I am doing good to others.
布卢姆：（结巴）我是在为别人做好事。

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)
（一群海鸥、风暴海燕，嘴里叼着班伯里蛋糕，饥饿地从利菲粘液中升起。）

THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.
海鸥：Kaw kave kankury kake。

BLOOM: The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
布鲁姆：人类的朋友。受善心训练。

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the munching spaniel.)
（他指着。鲍勃·多兰从高脚凳上摔下来，在正在咀嚼的西班牙猎犬身上晃来晃去。）

BOB DORAN: Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
鲍勃·多兰：托瑟。把爪子给我们。给爪子。

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig’s knuckle between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran fills silently into an area.)
（斗牛犬咆哮着，他的颈背竖立着，臼齿之间有一大口猪指关节，狂犬病的唾液从里面流淌出来。鲍勃·多兰默默地挤进了一个区域。）

SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.
第二点：防止虐待动物。

BLOOM: (Enthusiastically) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
布鲁姆：（热情地）这是一项崇高的工作！我在哈罗德十字桥上责骂了那个电车司机，因为他用马具上的伤疤迷惑了这匹可怜的马。我的法语很糟糕。当然，天气很冷，而且是最后一班电车。马戏团生活的所有故事都非常令人沮丧。

(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer’s costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging boarhound.)
（马菲先生脸色苍白，穿着驯兽师服装，衬衫前襟饰有钻石饰钉，他向前迈了​​一步，手里拿着一个马戏团纸箍、一根卷曲的马鞭和一把左轮手枪，用它来对付那只狼吞虎咽的野猪狗。）

SIGNOR MAFFEI: (With a sinister smile) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.
马菲先生：（带着阴险的微笑）女士们先生们，我受过教育的灰狗。这是我用我的专利食肉动物尖刺马鞍打破了狂野的野马阿贾克斯。用打结的丁字裤绑在腹部下方。滑车和绞杀滑轮会让你的狮子屈服，无论它多么暴躁，甚至是利比亚食人兽狮子座。一根烧红的撬棍和一些搽剂擦在燃烧的部位就产生了阿姆斯特丹的弗里茨，一只会思考的鬣狗。 （他怒视）我有印第安标志。我的眼睛闪烁着这些胸花。 （带着迷人的微笑）我现在介绍一下戒指中的骄傲——红宝石小姐。

FIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.
第一眼：来吧。姓名和地址。

BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.
布鲁姆：我暂时忘记了。是啊！ （他脱下高级帽子，敬礼）布卢姆医生，利奥波德，牙科医生。您听说过冯·布鲁姆帕夏。数以百万计。唐纳韦特！拥有一半奥地利。埃及。表哥。

FIRST WATCH: Proof.
第一眼：证明。

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom’s hat.)
（一张卡片从布鲁姆帽子的皮革头带内掉下来。）

BLOOM: (In red fez, cadi’s dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor’s Walk.
布卢姆：（身穿红色毡帽、卡迪礼服外套，系着绿色宽腰带，戴着假荣誉军团勋章，匆忙拿起卡片递给我）请允许。我的俱乐部是少年陆军和海军。律师：Messrs John Henry Menton，27 Bachelor’s Walk。

FIRST WATCH: (Reads) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully watching and besetting.
第一眼：（读）亨利·弗劳尔。无固定居所。非法观看和围攻。

SECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.
第二次观察：不在场证明。你被警告了。

BLOOM: (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don’t know his name. (Plausibly) You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom. The change of name. Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently) Dash it all. It’s a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily) I’ll introduce you, inspector. She’s game. Do it in the shake of a lamb’s tail.
布卢姆：（从心袋里掏出一朵皱巴巴的黄花）这就是有问题的花。这是一个我不知道他名字的人给我的。 （振振有词地）你知道那个老笑话，卡斯蒂利亚的玫瑰。盛开。更名。维拉格。 （他私下里、秘密地低声说道）你瞧，我们订婚了，中士。案件中的女士。爱情纠葛。 （他轻轻地扛起第二块手表）全部都扔掉吧。这是我们海军勇士的一种方式。制服就可以做到这一点。 （他严肃地转向第一更）不过，当然，有时你确实会遭遇滑铁卢。某个晚上顺便过来喝一杯老勃艮第葡萄酒。 （对二更欢快地）我来介绍你，督察。她是个游戏。摇动羔羊尾巴即可完成此操作。

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)
（出现了一张黑色水银脸，带领着一个蒙着面纱的身影。）

THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.
黑水星：城堡正在寻找他。他被赶出了军队。

MARTHA: (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing) Henry! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.
玛莎：（蒙着厚厚的面纱，脖子上系着深红色的吊带，手里拿着一份《爱尔兰时报》，用责备的语气指着）亨利！利奥波德！莱昂内尔，你失去了一个！清除我的名字。

FIRST WATCH: (Sternly) Come to the station.
第一班：（严厉地）到车站来。

BLOOM: (Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.
布卢姆：（害怕，戴上帽子，退后一步，然后，揪着自己的心，在广场上举起右前臂，做出了伙伴关系的标志和应有的警惕）不，不，尊敬的主人，爱之光。错误的身份。里昂的邮件。勒苏尔克斯和杜博斯克。你还记得查尔兹兄弟相残案吗？我们医务人员。用斧头把他打死。我被错误地指责了。一次有罪逃脱比九十九次被错误定罪要好。

MARTHA: (Sobbing behind her veil) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I’ll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.
玛莎：（在面纱后面抽泣）违背诺言。我的真名是佩吉·格里芬。他写信给我说他很痛苦。我会告诉我的兄弟，贝蒂夫橄榄球后卫，你这个无情的调情者。

BLOOM: (Behind his hand) She’s drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim) Shitbroleeth.
布鲁姆：（背后）她喝醉了。女人喝醉了。 （他含糊不清地低声念叨着以法莲的通行证）Shitbroleeth。

SECOND WATCH: (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.
第二次观察：（眼里含着泪水，对布卢姆）你应该为自己感到羞耻。

BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare’s nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain’s fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke’s Drift.
布鲁姆：陪审团先生们，让我解释一下。纯粹的马巢。我是一个被误解的人。我被当作替罪羊了。我是一个受人尊敬的已婚男人，我的品格上没有任何污点。我住在埃克尔斯街。我的妻子，我是一位最杰出的指挥官的女儿，一位英勇正直的绅士，你怎么称呼他，布赖恩·特威迪少将，他是帮助我们赢得战争的英国战士之一。因对罗克漂移的英勇辩护而获得多数席位。

FIRST WATCH: Regiment.
第一眼：军团。

BLOOM: (Turns to the gallery) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.
布鲁姆：（转向旁听席）都柏林皇家，孩子们，地球之盐，闻名于世。我想我在你们中间看到了一些老战友。 R.D.F.，与我们自己的大都会警察、我们家园的守护者、最勇敢的小伙子和最优秀的人一样，为我们的君主服务。

A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?
一个声音：叛徒！布尔人崛起！谁向乔·张伯伦发出嘘声？

BLOOM: (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch) My old dad too was a J. P. I’m as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.
布卢姆：（他的手放在第一块手表的肩膀上）我的老父亲也是一名 J.P。我和你一样是坚定的英国人，先生。电讯中提到，我在高夫将军率领的公园里为国王和国家而战，在心不在焉的战争中为国王和国家而战，并在斯皮昂科普和布隆方丹被打残。我做了一个白人能做的一切。 （带着平静的感觉）吉姆·布鲁德索。再次握住她的喷嘴。

FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.
第一眼：职业或贸易。

BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up …
布鲁姆：嗯，我从事文学职业，作家兼记者。事实上，我们只是推出了一本由我发明的获奖故事集，这是一个全新的起点。我与英国和爱尔兰媒体有联系。如果你打电话……

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)
（迈尔斯·克劳福德猛地大步走了出来，牙间叼着一支羽毛笔。他猩红色的喙在草帽的光环内闪闪发光。他一手拿着一束西班牙洋葱，另一只手把电话听筒放在耳边。）

MYLES CRAWFORD: (His cock’s wattles wagging) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman’s Urinal and Weekly Arsewipe here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?
迈尔斯·克劳福德：（他的肉棒摇晃）你好，七十七八十四。你好。弗里曼小便池和每周擦屁股在这里。让欧洲瘫痪。你哪个？蓝袋？谁写？是布卢姆吗？

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large portfolio labelled Matcham’s Masterstrokes.)
（菲利普·博福伊先生脸色苍白，站在证人席上，穿着一身精致的晨礼服，胸前的口袋里露出了手帕的尖角，穿着褶皱的淡紫色长裤，脚踩漆皮靴子。他带着一大堆标有“Matcham’s Masterlines”的档案袋。）

BEAUFOY: (Drawls) No, you aren’t. Not by a long shot if I know it. I don’t see it that’s all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a litterateur. It’s perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.
博福伊：（拖长语气）不，你不是。如果我知道的话，那绝对不是。我不明白，仅此而已。没有一个天生的绅士，没有一个有起码绅士气质的人会做出这种特别令人厌恶的行为。其中之一，陛下。抄袭者。一个伪装成文学家的肥皂剧鬼鬼祟祟的人。很明显，他以最本质的卑鄙抄袭了我的一些畅销书，非常华丽的东西，完美的宝石，其中的爱情段落值得怀疑。阁下无疑对博福伊关于爱情和伟大财产的书很熟悉，这些书在整个王国家喻户晓。

BLOOM: (Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may …
布卢姆：（带着忧郁的温顺低语声）关于那个手牵手大笑的女巫的事，我不同意，如果可以的话……

BEAUFOY: (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court) You funny ass, you! You’re too beastly awfully weird for words! I don’t think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses’ fees, shan’t we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.
博福伊：（他的嘴唇上翘，在场上傲慢地微笑）你这个有趣的混蛋！你实在是太奇怪了，无法用语言来形容！我认为你不需要在这方面过度让自己感到不自在。我的文学经纪人 J. B. Pinker 先生也出席了。陛下，我想我们会收到通常的证人费，不是吗？我们对这个勇敢的新闻记者约翰尼、这个兰斯的寒鸦、甚至没有上过大学的人来说，已经是掏空了。

BLOOM: (Indistinctly) University of life. Bad art.
布鲁姆：（含糊不清）大学生活。糟糕的艺术。

BEAUFOY: (Shouts) It’s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.
博福伊：（大喊）这是一个该死的谎言，暴露了这个人的道德败坏！ （他展开了他的档案袋）我们这里有确凿的证据，犯罪主体，大人，这是我成熟作品的一个样本，被野兽的标志所毁容。

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:
来自画廊的声音：

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
摩西，摩西，犹太人的王，

Wiped his arse in the Daily News.
在《每日新闻》上擦屁股。

BLOOM: (Bravely) Overdrawn.
布鲁姆：（勇敢地）透支了。

BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court) Why, look at the man’s private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!
博福伊：你这个卑鄙小人！你应该被扔进马塘里，你这个混蛋！ （对法庭）哎呀，看看这个人的私生活！领导四重存在！街头天使和家庭恶魔。混杂社会根本不配提！时代的大阴谋家！

BLOOM: (To the court) And he, a bachelor, how …
布鲁姆：（对法庭）而他，一个单身汉，怎么……

FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.
第一场比赛：国王对阵布鲁姆。打电话给那个女人德里斯科尔。

THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!
哭喊者：玛丽·德里斯科尔，女厨房女佣！

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)
（玛丽·德里斯科尔，一个衣着邋遢的女仆走过来。她臂弯上挎着一个水桶，手里拿着一把百洁刷。）

SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?
第二次观看：另一个！你属于不幸的阶层吗？

MARY DRISCOLL: (Indignantly) I’m not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.
玛丽·德里斯科尔：（愤怒地）我不是一个坏人。我的品格值得尊敬，最后一个职位已经呆了四个月了。我当时的处境是，每年六磅，周五我有机会外出，但由于他的随身携带，我不得不离开。

FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?
第一眼：你对他征什么税？

MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.
玛丽·德里斯科尔：他提出了一定的建议，但我更多地认为自己和我一样贫穷。

BLOOM: (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly) I treated you white. I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There’s a medium in all things. Play cricket.
布卢姆：（穿着波纹布家居服，法兰绒长裤，无跟拖鞋，胡子拉碴，头发乱糟糟的：轻柔地）我把你当成了白人。我给了你纪念品，漂亮的祖母绿吊袜带，远远高于你的位置。当你被指控偷窃时，我不小心站在了你的一边。万物皆有媒介。打板球。

MARY DRISCOLL: (Excitedly) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!
玛丽·德里斯科尔：（兴奋地）今晚如果我把手伸向牡蛎，上帝就会看不起我！

FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?
第一眼：所投诉的罪行？发生了什么事吗？

MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twict with my clothing.
玛丽·德里斯科尔：法官大人，有一天早上，当太太出去购物并索要一枚安全别针时，他对房屋的情况感到惊讶。他抱着我，结果我有四个地方变色了。他还干涉了我的衣服。

BLOOM: She counterassaulted.
布鲁姆：她反击了。

MARY DRISCOLL: (Scornfully) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet.
玛丽·德里斯科尔：（轻蔑地）我对百洁刷更加尊重，所以我尊重了。陛下，我向他提出劝告，他说：保持安静。

(General laughter.)
（普遍的笑声。）

GEORGE FOTTRELL: (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.
乔治·福特雷尔：（王室与治安书记官，响亮地）法庭下令！被告现在将做出虚假陈述。

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths’ child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever …
（布卢姆不认罪，手捧一朵盛开的睡莲，开始了一段冗长、难以理解的演讲。他们会听到律师在他对大陪审团的激动人心的演讲中必须说的话。他穷困潦倒，但是，尽管被贴上害群之马的标签，如果这么说吧，他是想改过自新，以纯粹姐妹的方式找回过去的记忆，回归自然，做一个纯粹的家畜。七个月大的孩子，被年老卧床的父母精心抚养长大。一个犯错的父亲可能会犯错，但他想改过自新，现在，当终于看到鞭刑柱时，他在晚年过着家常的生活，周围充满了充满爱意的环境。作为一个已经适应了环境的英国人，那个夏天的夜晚，他在环线铁路公司的引擎室的踏板上看到了这一幕，而雨却没有从可爱的家庭的窗户里瞥见。都柏林市和市区的场景真正是美好土地上的幸福乡村，多克雷尔的壁纸一打九便士，天真无邪的英国出生的婴儿口齿不清地向圣婴祈祷，年轻的学者们在与他们的笔作斗争，或者在钢琴上弹奏的模特年轻女士或不久之后，所有人都热情地围绕着噼啪作响的圣诞树背诵家庭念珠，而在博恩斯和绿色小巷中，科林斯带着他们的情人漫步，此时，有组织的旋律大不列颠金属结合的旋律，有四个表演停止和十二个风箱，这是一种牺牲，有史以来最伟大的交易……

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)
（又是笑声。他语无伦次地咕哝着。记者们抱怨说他们听不见。）

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: (Without looking up from their notebooks) Loosen his boots.
常记法和速记法：（没有从笔记本上抬起头）松开他的靴子。

PROFESSOR MACHUGH: (From the presstable, coughs and calls) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.
马休教授：（在新闻台上，咳嗽着喊道）咳咳，伙计。一点一点地把它拿出来。

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A large bucket. Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterer’s bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)
（盘问继续进行布卢姆和水桶。一个大水桶。布卢姆本人。肠道问题。在海狸街，抱怨，是的。相当糟糕。泥水匠的水桶。双腿僵直行走。遭受难以言喻的痛苦。致命的痛苦。大约中午。爱或酒红色。是的，一些菠菜。关键时刻。他没有看桶里的人。相当混乱。不完全。Titbits 的旧号码。）

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of stickingplaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)
（一片喧哗和嘘声。布卢姆穿着一件撕破的礼服，上面沾满了粉饰，头上戴着一顶有凹痕的丝质帽子，鼻子上贴着一块橡皮膏，说话声音听不见。）

J. J. O’MOLLOY: (In barrister’s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client’s family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler’s weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
J. J. 奥莫洛伊：（戴着律师的灰色假发，穿着长袍，用痛苦抗议的声音说话）这里不应该有不雅轻浮的地方，而牺牲一个在酒精中伪装的犯错的凡人。我们不是在熊园里，也不是在牛津破布前，这也不是对正义的嘲弄。我的委托人是一个婴儿，一个贫穷的外国移民，他从偷渡者开始白手起家，现在正试图赚点诚实的钱。捏造的轻罪是由于幻觉引起的暂时的遗传失常，在我委托人的故乡法老的土地上，这种所谓的犯罪事件是完全允许的。表面上看，我告诉你，没有试图在肉体上认识。亲密关系并没有发生，德里斯科尔抱怨的冒犯她的美德是被征求的，也没有再发生。我会特别讨论返祖现象。我的委托人的家庭中曾发生过海难和梦游的案例。如果被告能够说话，他就能讲述一个故事——这是有史以来在书籍封面之间讲述的最奇怪的故事之一。陛下，他本人就是补鞋匠虚弱的胸膛造成的身体残骸。他的陈述是，他有蒙古血统，对自己的行为不负责任。事实上，并非全部都在那里。

BLOOM: (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole’s eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply)
布卢姆：（赤脚，内八字胸，穿着拉斯卡的背心和裤子，歉意的脚趾内翻，睁开他那颗小鼹鼠的眼睛，茫然地环顾四周，一只手缓慢地抚过他的额头。然后他系上水手风格的腰带，东方人耸耸肩。向法庭致敬，将一根拇指指向天空。）他让夜晚变得美好。 （他开始简单地轻快地唱起来）

Li li poo lil chile
莉莉普莉尔智利

Blingee pigfoot evly night
Blingee 猪脚 evly 之夜

Payee two shilly …
收款人两个扭扭捏捏的……

(He is howled down.)
（他嚎叫着倒下。）

J. J. O’MOLLOY: (Hotly to the populace) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically, without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O’Molloy’s hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.
J. J. O’MOLLOY：（激烈地对民众）这是一场单枪匹马的战斗。哈迪斯发誓，我不会让我的任何一个客户被一群野狗和大笑的鬣狗以这种方式堵住嘴并纠缠。马赛克密码已经取代了丛林法则。我这么说，并且强调地这么说，一刻也不希望破坏正义的目的，被告在行为之前不是从犯，检察官也没有受到篡改。被告对待这名年轻人就像对待自己的女儿一样。 （布卢姆握住 J·J·奥莫洛伊的手，举到唇边。）我将提出反驳证据，以彻底证明那只隐藏的手又在玩它的老把戏了。如有疑问，就迫害布鲁姆。我的委托人是一个天生害羞的人，他是世界上最不会做任何不绅士的事情的人，因为有损谦虚的人会反对或向一个女孩扔石头，因为这个女孩在某些混蛋（对她的状况负有责任）工作时走错了方向。自己甜蜜的意志在她身上。他想直走。我认为他是我认识的最白人。由于他在遥远的小亚细亚阿根达斯内塔伊姆的大量财产被抵押，他目前的运气不佳，现在将展示这些财产的幻灯片。 （对布鲁姆）我建议你做一件漂亮的事。

BLOOM: A penny in the pound.
布卢姆：一分钱一分钱。

(The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)
（墙上投射着金尼勒斯湖的图像，牛群在银色的薄雾中模糊不清。摩西·德卢加茨（Moses Dlugacz）是一位雪眼白化病患者，穿着蓝色工作服，站在画廊里，两手各拿着一个橙色的柚子和一个猪肾。）

DLUGACZ: (Hoarsely) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.13.
DLUGACZ：（声音嘶哑）Bleibtreustraße，柏林，W.13。

(J. J. O’Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)
（J·J·奥莫洛伊走到一个低矮的底座上，严肃地握住外套的翻领。他的脸拉长，变得苍白，留着胡须，眼睛凹陷，有肺结核的斑点，颧骨像约翰·F·泰勒一样。他用他的用手帕捂住嘴，仔细观察汹涌澎湃的玫瑰粉色血流。）

J.J.O’MOLLOY: (Almost voicelessly) Excuse me. I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel’s book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)
J.J.O’MOLLOY：（几乎无声地）对不起。我正受着严重的寒战，最近才从病床上爬起来。几句话选得好。 （他假定了西摩·布什的头颅、狡猾的小胡子和长鼻的口才。）当天使的书被打开时，如果沉思的胸怀开启了灵魂的变形，而灵魂变形的东西值得活下去，我会说，让酒吧里的囚犯怀疑的神圣利益。 （一张写有东西的纸被交给法庭。）

BLOOM: (In court dress) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest … Queens of Dublin society. (Carelessly) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal at the levee. Sir Bob, I said …
布卢姆：（穿着宫廷服装）可以提供最好的参考。卡兰、科尔曼先生。威斯德姆·海利·J·P 先生：我的老首领乔·卡夫。 V. B. Dillon 先生，都柏林前市长。我已经进入了都柏林社会最高层……女王的迷人圈子。 （漫不经心地）今天下午我刚刚在总督府与我的老朋友罗伯特爵士和大堤皇家天文学家鲍尔女士聊天。鲍勃先生，我说……

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair) Arrest him, constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.
耶尔弗顿·巴里夫人：（穿着低胸花蛋白石舞会礼服，戴着齐肘的象牙色手套，戴着黑貂镶边的砖缝斗篷，头发上梳着明亮的梳子和鱼鹰的华丽）逮捕他，警员。当我丈夫在明斯特赛道的蒂珀雷里北区时，他反手给我写了一封匿名信，署名詹姆斯·洛夫伯奇。他说，当我坐在皇家剧院的包厢里观看《西加尔》的指挥演出时，他从众神那里看到了我无与伦比的地球仪。我深深地激怒了他，他说。下午四点半，他向我做出了不当行为的暗示。接下来的星期四，邓辛克时间。他主动提出要寄给我一本保罗·德·科克先生的小说，题为《拿着三对木棍的女孩》。

MRS BELLINGHAM: (In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was ablossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.
贝林厄姆夫人：（戴着帽子，披着海豹斗篷，一直包到鼻子，从她的马车里走出来，从她巨大的负鼠手袋里取出的龟甲检查眼镜扫视着）还有我。是的，我相信这是同一个令人反感的人。因为在九十三年二月的寒流中，他在桑利·斯托克爵士外面的一个雨夹雪天关上了我的马车门，当时连废水管的栅格和我浴室水箱里的球塞都结冰了。随后，正如他所说，为了向我致敬，他附上了一朵从高处采摘下来的雪绒花。我请植物学专家对它进行了检查，得到的信息是，它是从示范农场的一个强制箱中偷来的本土马铃薯植物的花朵。

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!
耶尔弗顿·巴里夫人： 他真丢脸！

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward)
（一群荡妇和衣衫褴褛的人涌上前）

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: (Screaming) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
荡妇和衣衫褴褛的人：（尖叫）阻止小偷！万岁，蓝胡子！为 Ikey Mo 喝彩三声！

SECOND WATCH: (Produces handcuffs) Here are the darbies.
第二次观看：（出示手铐）这是达比们。

MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me (stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me) to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.
贝林厄姆夫人：他用好几笔字迹对我表示赞赏，就像穿毛皮的维纳斯一样，并声称对我的霜冻车夫帕尔默深表同情，同时他又表达了自己对他的耳罩和柔软的羊皮以及他有幸与我亲近的嫉妒。 ，当站在我的椅子后面时，我穿着我的制服，戴着贝灵厄姆盾牌的徽章，装饰着紫貂，雄鹿的头被扣上或。他近乎夸张地赞扬了我的下肢，我肿胀的小腿，穿着丝袜，被拉到了极限，并热情洋溢地赞扬了我其他隐藏在无价蕾丝中的宝藏，他说，他可以变出这些宝藏。他怂恿我（说他觉得怂恿我是他一生的使命）玷污婚床，尽早犯奸淫。

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.
尊敬的默文·托尔博伊斯夫人：（身着亚马逊服装，戴着安全帽，穿着鸡刺长靴，朱红色背心，戴着带有编织鼓的小鹿火枪手手套，举着长长的拖裾，用狩猎作物不断地敲击她的伤口）还有我。因为他在凤凰城公园的马球场上看到我参加全爱尔兰队与爱尔兰其他地区队的比赛。我知道，当我看到因尼斯基林队的斯洛格·丹尼船长骑着他心爱的半人马赢得最后一场比赛时，我的眼睛闪闪发亮。这个平民唐璜从一辆出租汽车后面观察我，并用双层信封给我寄了一张淫秽照片，就像天黑后在巴黎林荫大道上出售的那样，侮辱了任何女士。我还留着呢它描绘了一位半裸的女士，脆弱而可爱（他郑重地向我保证，他的妻子是他从大自然中夺走的），正在与一名肌肉发达的斗牛士进行非法性交，后者显然是一个恶棍。他敦促我也这样做，行为不端，与驻军军官一起犯罪。他恳求我以难以形容的方式玷污他的信，按照他应得的惩罚他，骑在他身上，骑在他身上，给他最恶毒的马鞭。

MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.
贝林厄姆夫人：我也是。

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.
耶尔弗顿·巴里夫人： 我也是。

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)
（几位德高望重的都柏林女士拿着从布鲁姆收到的不当信件。）

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of fury) I will, by the God above me. I’ll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I’ll flay him alive.
尊敬的默文·托尔博伊斯夫人：（突然爆发出一阵狂怒，踩着叮当作响的马刺）我会的，上帝发誓。只要我还能站在那头鸽子身上，我就会鞭打他。我会活剥他的皮。

BLOOM: (His eyes closing, quails expectantly) Here? (He squirms) Again! (He pants cringing) I love the danger.
布卢姆：（闭上眼睛，期待地颤抖）在这儿吗？ （他蠕动）又来了！ （他气​​喘吁吁）我喜欢危险。

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I’ll make it hot for you. I’ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.
尊敬的默文·托尔博伊斯夫人： 非常如此！我会给你做热的。我会让你为此跳舞杰克·拉腾。

MRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!
贝林厄姆夫人：把他的屁股晒黑了，暴发户！在上面写上星条旗！

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Disgraceful! There’s no excuse for him! A married man!
耶尔弗顿·巴里夫人： 可耻！他没有任何借口！一个已婚男人！

BLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.
布鲁姆：所有这些人。我的意思只是打屁股的想法。温暖而刺痛的光芒，没有渗出。精制桦木可促进血液循环。

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (Laughs derisively) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.
尊敬的默文·托尔博伊斯夫人：（嘲笑地笑）哦，是吗，我的好朋友？好吧，永生上帝发誓，相信我，你现在会得到一生中的惊喜，这是一个人所期望的最无情的隐藏。你把我本性中休眠的母老虎激怒了。

MRS BELLINGHAM: (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o’-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.
贝林厄姆夫人：（怀恨在心地摇晃手筒和检验眼镜）亲爱的汉娜，让他聪明点。给他姜。狠狠地殴打那只杂种狗，让它差点丧命。九尾猫。把他宰了。对他进行活体解剖。

BLOOM: (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek)
布卢姆：（颤抖着，畏缩着，合起双手：一副垂头丧气的样子）噢，冷！哦，颤抖！那是你的芳香之美。忘记原谅。天运。放过我一次吧（他伸出另一边脸）

MRS YELVERTON BARRY: (Severely) Don’t do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
耶尔弗顿·巴里夫人：（严肃地）托尔博伊斯夫人，任何人都不要这样做！他应该被狠狠地打一顿！

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently) I’ll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I’ll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?
尊敬的默文·托尔博伊斯夫人：（用力解开手套的扣子）我不会做这样的事。猪狗，从他小时候起就一直是！竟然敢对我说话！我会在公共街道上把他打得鼻青脸肿。我要把我的马刺挖到他身上。他是一个众所周知的戴绿帽子。 （她在空中野蛮地挥舞着猎帽）赶紧把他的裤子脱下来。过来吧，先生！快的！准备好？

BLOOM: (Trembling, beginning to obey) The weather has been so warm.
布卢姆：（颤抖着，开始服从）天气这么暖和。

(Davy Stephens, ringletted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

（一片雾气迅速滚滚而去，陪审席上迅速显露出了马丁·坎宁安、头戴丝帽的工头、杰克·鲍尔、西蒙·迪达勒斯、汤姆·克南、内德·兰伯特、约翰·亨利·曼顿·迈尔斯·克劳福德、莱尼汉、帕迪·伦纳德、诺西·弗林、麦考伊和无名者那张毫无特征的脸。）

第二次观看：（敬畏，低声）而且是黑色的。一个摩门教徒。无政府主义者。

THE CRIER: (Loudly) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a wellknown dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold and a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable …
哭诉者：（大声）鉴于居无定所的利奥波德·布鲁姆是众所周知的炸药者、伪造者、重婚者、妓女和戴绿帽子的人，对都柏林公民来说是公害，而在本次巡回审判委员会中，最尊贵的……

(His Honour, sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)
（都柏林特委弗雷德里克·福尔金纳爵士阁下，身着灰石司法服，蓄着石须，从长凳上站起来。他怀里握着一把雨伞权杖。他的前额上赫然浮现着马赛克羊角。）

THE RECORDER: I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty’s pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)
记录员：我将结束这种白人奴隶贩卖现象，并让都柏林摆脱这种可恶的害虫。可耻！ （他戴上黑帽子）副警长先生，让他从他现在站立的码头上被带走，并在陛下高兴的时候被关押在芒特乔伊监狱，并被绞死，直到他死为止，因此不要辜负你的期望。危险或愿主怜悯你的灵魂。把他除掉。 （一顶黑色无边便帽落在他的头上。）

(The subsheriff Long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)
（副警长约翰·范宁出现，抽着刺鼻的亨利·克莱烟。）

LONG JOHN FANNING: (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance) Who’ll hang Judas Iscariot?
高个子约翰·范宁：（皱着眉头，用丰富的滚动声音喊叫）谁来绞死加略人犹大？

(H. Rumbold, master barber, in a bloodcoloured jerkin and tanner’s apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder, mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grappling hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)
（H·朗博尔德，理发师大师，穿着血色背心和制革围裙，肩上盘着一根绳子，登上了理发台。他的腰带上插着救生圈和钉有钉子的大棒。他冷酷地搓着用指节套固定的双手。 .)

RUMBOLD: (To the recorder with sinister familiarity) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.
朗伯德：（以阴险而熟悉的语气对录音机）吊死哈利，陛下，默西恐怖分子。颈静脉五几尼。脖子或者什么都没有。

(The bells of George’s church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)
（乔治教堂的钟声缓慢地敲响，响亮的黑铁钟声。）

THE BELLS: Heigho! Heigho!
钟声：嘿嘿！嘿嘿！

BLOOM: (Desperately) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzee. (Breathlessly) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more …
布鲁姆：（绝望地）等等。停止。海鸥。良好的心脏。我看见。纯真。猴舍里的女孩。动物园。淫荡的黑猩猩。 （气喘吁吁）盆腔。她天真无邪的脸红让我失去了理智。 （激动不已）我离开了辖区。 （他转向人群中的一个人，恳求）海因斯，我可以和你说话吗？你了解我。那三先令你可以留着。如果你想要多一点……

FIRST WATCH: (Draws his truncheon) Liar!
第一眼：（抽出警棍）骗子！

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eye flashes bloodshot. Half of one ear, all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)
（小猎犬抬起鼻子，露出帕迪·迪格纳姆那张患坏血病的灰色脸。他把一切都啃光了。他呼出一股腐烂的死尸呼吸。他长到了人类的大小和形状。他的腊肠犬皮毛变成了棕色的停尸服。他的绿眼睛闪烁着血丝。 .一只耳朵的一半，整个鼻子和两个拇指都被吃掉了。）

PADDY DIGNAM: (In a hollow voice) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.
帕迪·迪格南：（声音空洞）确实如此。这是我的葬礼。当我因自然原因死于这种疾病时，菲纽肯医生宣布生命已经灭绝。

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)
（他抬起那张残缺不全、灰白的脸，向着月亮，悲伤地哭喊着。）

FIRST WATCH: It is not in the penny catechism.
第一眼：它不在便士教义问答中。

PADDY DIGNAM: By metempsychosis. Spooks.
PADDY DIGNAM：通过轮回。幽灵。

A VOICE: O rocks.
一个声音：噢，岩石。

PADDY DIGNAM: (Earnestly) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor’s Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn’t agree with me.
帕迪·迪格南：（真诚地）我曾经受雇于 J. H. Menton 先生，他是 27 Bachelor’s Walk 的律师、宣誓和宣誓书专员。现在我已不复存在，心壁肥厚。硬线条。可怜的妻子伤得很厉害。她如何承受？让她远离那瓶雪利酒。 （他环顾四周）一盏灯。我必须满足动物的需求。那个酪乳不适合我。

(The portly figure of John O’Connell, caretaker, stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toadbellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff twisted poppies.)
（看门人约翰·奥康奈尔肥胖的身躯站在前面，手里拿着一串用黑纱绑着的钥匙。在他旁边站着科菲神父，他是牧师，大腹便便，歪脖子，穿着法衣，戴着头巾睡帽，睡眼惺忪地拿着一束扭曲的罂粟花。 ）

FATHER COFFEY: (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak) Namine. Jacobs. Vobiscuits. Amen.
科菲神父：（打哈欠，然后用嘶哑的声音吟诵）纳明。雅各布斯。沃饼干。阿门。

JOHN O’CONNELL: (Foghorns stormily through his megaphone) Dignam, Patrick T, deceased.
约翰·奥康奈尔：（通过扩音器发出暴风雨般的声音）帕特里克·T·迪格纳姆（Dignam），已故。

PADDY DIGNAM: (With pricked up ears, winces) Overtones. (He wriggles forward and places an ear to the ground) My master’s voice!
帕迪·迪格南：（竖起耳朵，畏缩）泛音。 （他向前蠕动，把一只耳朵贴在地上）我主人的声音！

JOHN O’CONNELL: Burial docket letter number U. P. eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.
约翰·奥康奈尔：埋葬记录信编号 U.P. 八万五千。场十七。钥匙之家。情节，一百零一个。

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tail stiffpointcd, his ears cocked.)
（帕迪·迪格纳姆用明显的努力听着，思考着，他的尾巴僵硬，耳朵竖起。）

PADDY DIGNAM: Pray for the repose of his soul.
帕迪·迪格南：为他的灵魂安息祈祷。

(He worms down through a coalhole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam’s voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam’s dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his twocolumned machine.)
（他从一个煤洞里爬下来，他的棕色习惯拖着绳子在嘎嘎作响的鹅卵石上拖着。在他用灰色甲壳下的真菌乌龟爪子摇晃着一只肥胖的祖父鼠之后。迪格南的声音低沉，在地下咆哮：迪格南死了，消失在下面汤姆·罗奇福德，红胸知更鸟，戴着帽子，穿着马裤，从他的双柱机器上跳下来。）

TOM ROCHFORD: (A hand to his breastbone, bows) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.
汤姆·罗奇福德：（一只手放在胸骨上，鞠躬）鲁本·J。我找到了他，一弗罗林。 （他坚定地盯着检修孔）现在轮到我了。跟我去卡洛。

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble, eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again through the sump. Kisses chirp amid the rifts of fog a piano sounds. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)
（他在空中做了一次勇敢的鲑鱼跳跃，被吞没在煤坑里。柱子上的两个圆盘摇晃着，虚无的眼睛。一切都退去。布卢姆再次沉重地向前穿过污水坑。吻在雾的裂缝中叽叽喳喳，钢琴声响起。他站在一座灯火通明的房子前，倾听着。亲吻从凉亭里飞过，在他周围飞舞，叽叽喳喳，叽叽喳喳，咕咕叫。）

THE KISSES: (Warbling) Leo! (Twittering) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing) Coo coocoo! Yummyyum, Womwom! (Warbling) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering) Leeolee! (Warbling) O Leo!
亲吻：（颤抖地）狮子座！ （推特）狮子座的 Icky licky micky 粘性！ （咕咕）咕咕！好吃，沃姆沃姆！ （颤声）大来大！旋转！利奥波波德！ （推特）Leolee！ （颤声）狮子座啊！

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddy flecks, silvery sequins.)
（它们沙沙作响，在他的衣服上飘扬，落下，明亮的令人眼花缭乱的斑点，银色的亮片。）

BLOOM: A man’s touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.
布鲁姆：男人的触感。悲伤的音乐。教堂音乐。也许在这里。

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)
（佐伊·希金斯，一个年轻的妓女，穿着蓝宝石衬裙，用三个青铜扣扣住，脖子上围着一条细长的黑色天鹅绒圆角，点点头，走下台阶，和他搭话。）

ZOE: Are you looking for someone? He’s inside with his friend.
佐伊：你在找人吗？他和他的朋友在里面。

BLOOM: Is this Mrs Mack’s?
布鲁姆：这是麦克夫人的吗？

ZOE: No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen’s. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly) She’s on the job herself tonight with the vet her tipster that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck’s turned today. (Suspiciously) You’re not his father, are you?
佐伊：不，八十岁。科恩夫人的。你可能会走得更远，情况也会更糟。妈妈拖鞋。 （熟悉地）今晚她自己和她的兽医一起工作，她的线人给了她所有的赢家，并支付她在牛津的儿子的费用。加班加点，但今天她的运气发生了转变。 （疑惑）你不是他父亲吧？

BLOOM: Not I!
布鲁姆：我不是！

ZOE: You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?
佐伊：你们都穿黑色衣服。小老鼠今晚有痒吗？

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand glides over his left thigh.)
（他的皮肤警觉地感觉到她的指尖正在靠近。一只手滑过他的左大腿。）

ZOE: How’s the nuts?
佐伊：坚果怎么样？

BLOOM: Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier, I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.
布鲁姆：偏离了一边。奇怪的是他们在右边。我想，更重。我的裁缝梅西亚斯说，百万分之一。

ZOE: (In sudden alarm) You’ve a hard chancre.
佐伊：（突然惊慌）你有硬下疳。

BLOOM: Not likely.
布鲁姆：不太可能。

ZOE: I feel it.
佐伊：我感觉到了。

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)
（她的手滑进他左边的裤兜，拿出一个又硬又黑、干瘪的土豆。她用湿润的嘴唇看着它和布卢姆。）

BLOOM: A talisman. Heirloom.
布鲁姆：护身符。传家宝。

ZOE: For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?
佐伊：为了佐伊？为了保留？因为这么好，是吗？

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)
（她贪婪地把土豆放进口袋里，然后挽住他的手臂，温柔地温暖地拥抱着他。他不安地微笑着。慢慢地，一个音符一个音符地播放着东方音乐。他凝视着她那双黄褐色的水晶般的眼睛，周围环绕着酒精。他的笑容变得柔和。）

ZOE: You’ll know me the next time.
佐伊：下次你就会认识我了。

BLOOM: (Forlornly) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to …
布鲁姆：（悲伤地）我从来没有爱过亲爱的瞪羚，但它肯定会……

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)
（瞪羚在跳跃，在山上吃食。附近有湖泊。在他们的海岸周围投射出雪松树的黑色阴影。香气升起，树脂的浓密毛发生长。它燃烧，东方，蓝宝石的天空，被青铜色的鹰群劈开……在它的下面，是裸体的女人之城，洁白，宁静，冷静，奢华。喷泉在大马士革玫瑰中低语。猛犸玫瑰低语着猩红色的葡萄。一种羞耻、欲望、鲜血的酒散发着，奇怪地低语。）

ZOE: (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.
佐伊：（随着音乐低声歌唱，她的宫女嘴唇上涂满了猪脂和玫瑰水的药膏）Schorach ani wenowach，benoith Hierushaloim。

BLOOM: (Fascinated) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.
布卢姆：（着迷）我觉得你的口音很不错。

ZOE: And you know what thought did?
佐伊：你知道想法是什么吗？

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth, sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)
（她用镶着金牙的小牙齿轻轻地咬着他的耳朵，向他吹来一股陈旧大蒜的令人腻味的气息。玫瑰花散开，露出一座国王的金子坟墓和他们腐烂的骨头。）

BLOOM: (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand) Are you a Dublin girl?
布卢姆：（退后一步，用一只笨拙的平手机械地爱抚她的右宝宝）你是都柏林女孩吗？

ZOE: (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil) No bloody fear. I’m English. Have you a swaggerroot?
佐伊：（巧妙地抓住一根散乱的头发，将其盘成一圈）没有该死的恐惧。我是英国人。你有一个招摇的根吗？

BLOOM: (As before) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.
布卢姆：（和以前一样）很少抽烟，亲爱的。时不时抽一支雪茄。幼稚的装置。 （猥亵地）用嘴比用一筒杂草更好地接合。

ZOE: Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.
佐伊：继续。以此为基础发表一次演讲。

BLOOM: (In workman’s corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Ralegh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will understanding, all. That is to say he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!
布卢姆：（穿着工装灯芯绒工作服，黑色甘西丝，系着红色飘逸领带，戴着阿帕奇帽）人类是不可救药的。沃尔特·罗利爵士从新世界带来了土豆和杂草，一种是通过吸收而消灭瘟疫的杀手，另一种是耳朵、眼睛、心脏、记忆、意志理解等一切的毒害者。也就是说，他带来毒药的时间比另一个我忘记名字的人带来食物的时间早了一百年。自杀。谎言。我们所有的习惯。为什么，看看我们的公共生活！

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)
（午夜的钟声从远处的尖塔传来。）

THE CHIMES: Turn again, Leopold! Lord mayor of Dublin!
钟声：再转过来，利奥波德！都柏林市长阁下！

BLOOM: (In alderman’s gown and chain) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That’s the music of the future. That’s my programme. Cui bono? But our bucaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance …
布卢姆：（穿着市议员长袍，戴着链子）阿兰码头、因斯码头、圆形大厅、芒特乔伊和北码头的选帝侯们，最好运营一条从牛市场到河边的有轨电车线路。这就是未来的音乐。这就是我的计划。崔博诺？但我们的海盗范德德肯家族在他们的幽灵金融船上……

AN ELECTOR: Three times three for our future chief magistrate!
一位选民：为我们未来的首席法官三乘三！

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)
（火炬游行队伍中的北极光跳跃。）

THE TORCHBEARERS: Hooray!
火炬手：万岁！

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)
（几位知名的市民、城市大亨和城市自由民与布鲁姆握手并向他表示祝贺。已故三次担任都柏林市长的蒂莫西·哈灵顿，身着猩红色市长服、佩戴金链子和白色丝绸领带，与议员洛肯·夏洛克（Lorcan Sherlock）代理会谈。 ……他们用力点头表示同意。）

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON: (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and large white silk scarf) That alderman sir Leo Bloom’s speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.
已故市长哈林顿：（身穿猩红色长袍，佩戴狼牙棒、金色市长链和白色大丝巾）市议员利奥·布鲁姆爵士的演讲稿将由纳税人承担印刷费用。他出生的房子上装饰着一块纪念牌，科克街附近迄今为止被称为“牛客厅”的大道今后将被指定为“布鲁姆大道”。

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK: Carried unanimously.
洛肯·夏洛克议员：一致通过。

BLOOM: (Impassionedly) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bugbears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev …
布卢姆：（热情地）这些飞翔的荷兰人或撒谎的荷兰人斜倚在软垫船尾掷骰子，他们在想什么？机器是他们的呼声、他们的幻想、他们的灵丹妙药。节省劳动力的装置、取代者、熊怪、为了互相谋杀而制造的怪物、由一群资本主义欲望对我们被卖淫的劳动力产生的可怕的妖怪。当他们正在给皇家山鹿喂草或者在他们盲目的佩尔兹和权力的盛况中射杀农民和雉鸡时，穷人就会挨饿。但他们的统治令人敬畏，永远……

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mile Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel Spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the King’s own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering the pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. After them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopers, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimneysweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertakers, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion brokers, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bedchamber, Black Rod, Deputy Garter, Gold Stick, the master of horse, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen’s iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward’s staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom’s boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

布鲁姆：开枪射杀他！基督徒的狗！ M’Intosh 就到此为止了！

Babes and sucklings are held up.)
（一声炮响。穿麦金塔的人消失了。布卢姆用权杖击倒了罂粟花。据报道，许多强大的敌人、牧场主、议会成员、常务委员会成员瞬间死亡。布卢姆的保镖分发了濯足金、纪念奖章，面包和鱼，禁酒徽章，昂贵的亨利·克莱雪茄，免费的汤牛骨，用金线绑在密封信封里的橡胶防腐剂，黄油苏格兰威士忌，菠萝冰，三角帽形状的钢坯，现成的套装，蟾蜍粥洞、几瓶杰耶斯流体、购买邮票、40 天的放纵、假硬币、乳制品猪肉香肠、剧院通行证、所有有轨电车线路的季票、皇家和特权匈牙利彩票的优惠券、便士晚餐柜台、廉价重印的世界上最糟糕的十二本书：《青蛙与弗里茨》（政治）、《照顾婴儿》（婴儿）、《7/6 的 50 顿饭》（烹饪）、《耶稣是太阳神话吗？》（历史）、《驱除痛苦》（医学）、《婴儿纲要》宇宙（宇宙）、让我们一起欢笑（热闹）、Canvasser's Vade Mecum（期刊）、母亲助理的情书（情色）、太空名人录（阿斯特里克）、触及我们内心的歌曲（旋律）、Pennywise 的致富之路（简约）。普遍的匆忙和争夺。女人们纷纷向前触摸布鲁姆长袍的下摆。格温德琳·杜贝达夫人冲破人群，跳上他的马，在一片欢呼声中亲吻他的双颊。拍摄了镁手电筒照片。婴儿和乳儿被举起来。）

ALEXANDER J DOWIE: (ViolentlY) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!
亚历山大·J·道伊（Alexander J Dowie）：（激烈地）基督徒和反布鲁姆派的同胞们，这个叫布鲁姆的人来自地狱，是基督徒的耻辱。门德斯的这只臭山羊从小就是一个恶魔般的浪荡子，表现出早熟的婴儿放荡的迹象，让人想起平原上的城市，还有一个放荡的祖母。这个卑鄙的伪君子，因臭名昭著而变成古铜色，就是《启示录》中提到的白牛。作为深红女人的崇拜者，阴谋就是他鼻孔里的气息。木桩和烧油的大锅都是给他的。卡利班！

THE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He’s as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
暴民：用私刑处死他！把他烤了！他和帕内尔一样糟糕。狐狸先生！

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep’s tails, odd pieces of fat.)
（格罗根妈妈向布鲁姆扔靴子。多塞特上下街的几位店主扔了几乎没有商业价值的物品，火腿、炼乳罐、滞销的卷心菜、不新鲜的面包、羊尾巴和奇怪的脂肪片。）

BLOOM: (Excitedly) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin’s Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.
布卢姆：（兴奋地）这就是盛夏的疯狂，又是一些可怕的笑话。老天爷啊，我就像未晒过的雪一样无罪！这是我的兄弟亨利。他是我的替身。他住在 2 号海豚谷仓。诽谤这条毒蛇，错误地指责了我。同胞们，Sgenl Inn ban bata coisde gan capall。我请我的老朋友、性专家 Malachi Mulligan 博士代表我提供医学证词。

DR MULLIGAN: (In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace’s private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.
穆利根博士：（穿着运动背心，额头上戴着绿色运动护目镜）布鲁姆博士是双性恋异常者。他最近从尤斯塔斯博士为精神失常绅士开设的私人庇护所逃了出来。因病而生的遗传性癫痫症是存在的，这是无节制的欲望的结果。在他的后代中发现了象皮病的痕迹。慢性暴露癖有明显的症状。双元性也是潜在的。他因自虐而过早秃顶，结果变得反常的理想主义，一个改过自新的浪子，并拥有金属牙齿。由于家庭情结，他暂时失去了记忆，我相信他所受的罪孽比犯罪更严重。我做了阴道检查，并对5427根肛毛、腋毛、胸毛和阴毛进行了酸测试，我宣布他是完整处女座。

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)
（布鲁姆把他的高级帽子放在他的生殖器官上。）

DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
DR MADDEN：尿道下裂也有标记。为了子孙后代的利益，我建议将受影响的部分保存在国家畸形学博物馆的烈酒中。

DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient’s urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
CROTTHERS 医生：我检查了病人的尿液。它是类白蛋白。唾液分泌不足，髌骨反射间歇。

DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.
PUNCH COSTELLO 博士：犹太恶臭是最容易察觉的。

DR DIXON: (Reads a bill of health) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests’ Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer’s peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.
迪克森博士：（宣读健康法案）布鲁姆教授是新女性男人的典范。他的道德本性单纯而可爱。许多人认为他是一个可爱的人，一个可爱的人。总的来说，他是一个相当古怪的人，虽然从医学意义上来说并不弱智，但他却很腼腆。他给改革宗牧师保护协会的宫廷传教士写了一封非常漂亮的信，本身就是一首诗，这澄清了一切。他实际上是一个完全戒酒的人，我可以肯定他睡在稻草垫上，吃最斯巴达的食物，杂货店的冷干豌豆。他冬天和夏天都穿着纯爱尔兰制造的毛衣，每周六都会鞭打自己。据我所知，他曾经是格伦克里管教所的一级轻罪犯。另一份报告称他是一个非常遗腹子。我以我们的发声器官被要求说出的最神圣的词的名义呼吁宽大处理。他快要生孩子了。

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I. O. U’s, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)
（普遍的骚动和同情心。妇女们晕倒了。一位富有的美国人为布鲁姆制作了街头收藏品。金银币、空白支票、纸币、珠宝、国债、到期汇票、I.O.U、结婚戒指、表链、挂坠盒、项链手镯很快就会被收集起来。）

BLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.
布鲁姆：哦，我非常想成为一名母亲。

MRS THORNTON: (In nursetender’s gown) Embrace me tight, dear. You’ll be soon over it. Tight, dear.
桑顿夫人：（穿着保姆长袍）亲爱的，紧紧地拥抱我。你很快就会克服它的。紧，亲爱的。

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindoree, Silversmile, Silberselber, Vifargent, Panargyros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vicechairmen of hotel syndicates.)
（布卢姆紧紧地拥抱着她，生了八个黄色和白色的男孩。他们出现在铺着红地毯的楼梯上，楼梯上装饰着昂贵的植物。八个八胞胎都很英俊，有着珍贵的金属面孔，体格考究，衣着得体，举止得体，能流利地讲五种现代语言，而且很感兴趣每个人的衬衫前襟上都印有清晰的字母：Nasodoro、Goldfinger、Chrysostomos、Maindoree、Silversmile、Silberselber、Vifargent、Panargyros。他们立即被任命为几个不同国家的高度公众信任的职位，如管理人员银行董事、铁路交通经理、有限责任公司董事长、酒店集团副董事长。）

A VOICE: Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?
一个声音：布鲁姆，你是弥赛亚本约瑟夫还是本大卫？

BLOOM: (Darkly) You have said it.
布鲁姆：（阴沉地）你已经说过了。

BROTHER BUZZ: Then perform a miracle like Father Charles.
巴兹弟兄：那就像查尔斯神父一样创造奇迹吧。

BANTAM LYONS: Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.
BANTAM LYONS：预言谁将赢得圣莱杰奖。

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson’s Pillar, hangs from the top ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from king’s evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Kossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)
（布卢姆在网上行走，用左耳遮住左眼，穿过几堵墙，爬上纳尔逊柱子，用眼睑悬挂在顶部壁架上，吃十二打牡蛎（包括贝壳），治愈了几位遭受国王邪恶之苦的人，收缩他的脸以模仿许多历史人物，比肯斯菲尔德勋爵、拜伦勋爵、瓦特·泰勒、埃及的摩西、摩西·迈蒙尼德、摩西·门德尔松、亨利·欧文、瑞普·凡·温克尔、科苏斯、让·雅克·卢梭、利奥波德·罗斯柴尔德男爵、鲁宾逊·漂流记、夏洛克·福尔摩斯，巴斯德，同时将每只脚转向不同的方向，命令潮水回头，伸出他的小指遮住太阳。）

（所有人都向布鲁姆扔出柔软的哑剧石头。许多真诚的旅行者和无主的狗靠近他并玷污了他。马斯蒂安斯基和西特隆穿着华达呢衣服，戴着长耳锁走近。他们对布鲁姆摇着胡须。）

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Vincent O’brien, sings the chorus from Handel’s Messiah alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)
（由文森特·奥布莱恩指挥的六百人合唱团，在约瑟夫·格林的管风琴伴奏下，唱着亨德尔的《弥赛亚哈利路亚》中的副歌，主神万能的统治。布卢姆变得沉默、萎缩、碳化。）

ZOE: Talk away till you’re black in the face.
佐伊：别说话，直到你脸都黑了。

BLOOM: (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant’s red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I’m after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life’s dream is o’er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.
布卢姆：（穿着考宾服装，乐队里插着陶制烟斗，穿着沾满灰尘的布洛克鞋，手里拿着一捆移民的红手帕，牵着一头黑布高克猪，眼里含着微笑）现在让我走吧，女人房子，因为康尼马拉所有的山羊都在追寻着他们的父亲和母亲的战斗。 （眼里含着泪水）一切都是疯狂的。爱国主义、对死者的哀悼、音乐、种族的未来。生存还是毁灭。人生的梦想就在眼前。和平地结束吧。他们可以继续生活。 （他悲伤地凝视远方）我毁了。几颗附子锭剂。百叶窗拉上了。一封信。然后躺回去休息。 （他轻轻地呼吸）不再了。我活过。票价。告别。

ZOE: (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts!
佐伊：（僵硬地，手指插在脖颈上）诚实吗？直到下次。 （她冷笑）假设你起床的方向不对，或者你和你最好的女孩来得太快了。噢，我能读懂你的想法！

BLOOM: (Bitterly) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle. I’m sick of it. Let everything rip.

布卢姆：（悔恨地）我非常不同意。你是必要的邪恶。你从哪来？伦敦？

佐伊：（轻松地）猪的诺顿，猪在那里演奏管风琴。我是约克郡出生的。 （她握着他的手，摸着她的乳头）我说，汤米·小老鼠。停止这种行为并开始更糟糕的事情。你有短期现金吗？十先令？

BLOOM: (Smiles, nods slowly) More, houri, more.
布卢姆：（微笑，缓慢点头）更多，houri，更多。

ZOE: And more’s mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I’ll peel off.
佐伊：莫尔的母亲呢？ （她用天鹅绒爪子随意地拍了拍他）你要来音乐室看我们的新钢琴吗？来吧，我会剥掉。

BLOOM: (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly) You know how difficult it is. I needn’t tell you.
布卢姆：（怀疑地摸着自己的后脑勺，就像一个被骚扰的小贩在衡量她剥了皮的梨子的对称性一样无比尴尬）如果她知道的话，有人会嫉妒得要命。绿眼怪物。 （真诚地）你知道这有多困难。我不用告诉你。

ZOE: (Flattered) What the eye can’t see the heart can’t grieve for. (She pats him) Come.
佐伊：（受宠若惊）眼睛看不到的东西，心却无法悲伤。 （她拍拍他）来吧。

ZOE: Babby!
佐伊：宝贝！

布卢姆：（身穿婴儿亚麻布和紧身衣，大头，留着一团黑发，大眼睛盯着她流畅的衬裙，用胖乎乎的手指数着它的青铜带扣，他潮湿的舌头懒洋洋地、口齿不清）一二tlee：tlee tlwo tlone。

THE BUCKLES: Love me. Love me not. Love me.
带扣：爱我。不爱我。爱我。

ZOE: Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.
ZOE：沉默就是同意。 （她用小爪子抓住了他的手，她的食指向他的手掌传递了秘密监视器的密码，引诱他走向毁灭。） 热手冷砂。

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)
（他在香气、音乐、诱惑中犹豫不决。她领着他走向台阶，用她腋窝的气味、她画着的眼睛的恶习、她滑裙的沙沙声吸引着他，她那蜿蜒的褶皱里潜伏着所有男性的狮子臭气。那些已经占有了她的畜生。）

THE MALE BRUTES: (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro) Good!
雄性畜生：（呼出车辙和粪便中的硫磺，在松散的盒子里爬行，微弱地咆哮，他们被麻醉的头来回摇晃）好极了！

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)
（佐伊和布鲁姆走到门口，那里坐着两个妓女姐妹。她们从眉毛下好奇地打量着他，并对他匆忙鞠躬微笑。他笨拙地绊倒了。）

ZOE: (Her lucky hand instantly saving him) Hoopsa! Don’t fall upstairs.
ZOE：（她的幸运之手立刻救了他）Hoopsa！别从楼上摔下来。

BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold) After you is good manners.
布鲁姆：正义之人会跌倒七次。 （他站在门口）在你之后是礼貌。

ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.
ZOE：女士优先，先生之后。

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall hang a man ‘s hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an ape’s gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)
（她跨过门槛。他犹豫了。她转身，伸出双手，把他拉过去。他跳了起来。大厅的鹿角架上挂着一顶防水的男士帽子。布卢姆揭开自己的衣服，但看到它们，皱起眉头，然后微笑着，全神贯注。回程平台上的一扇门被推开。一个穿着紫色衬衫和灰色裤子、穿着棕色袜子的男人，以猿猴般的步态走过，他的光头和山羊胡子高举着，抱着一个装满水的壶，他的双尾黑色背带晃来晃去的高跟鞋。布卢姆迅速转过脸去，弯下腰去检查大厅桌上一只奔跑的狐狸的西班牙猎犬的眼睛：然后，他抬起头嗅着，跟着佐伊走进音乐室。淡紫色的纸巾使枝形吊灯的光线变暗。飞蛾围着飞蛾飞翔，碰撞，逃跑。地板上铺着玉石、天蓝色和朱砂菱形的油布马赛克。上面印着各种脚印，脚跟到脚跟，脚跟到空心，脚趾到脚趾，双脚锁在一起，莫里斯拖着脚走，没有身体幻影，一切都在混战中。墙壁上挂满了紫杉叶和清澈的空地。炉排上铺着孔雀羽毛屏风。林奇盘腿蹲在乱糟糟的头发的壁炉地毯上，帽子向后扣在前面。他用魔杖慢慢地打着时间。基蒂·里基茨是一位瘦骨嶙峋、苍白的妓女，穿着海军蓝服装，戴着鹿皮手套，从珊瑚腕带上卷起来，手里拿着一个链条钱包，坐在桌子边上，摆动着腿，在壁炉架上的镀金镜子里看着自己。她的紧身胸衣的标签挂在夹克的下方。林奇嘲笑地指着弹钢琴的夫妇。）

KITTY: (Coughs behind her hand) She’s a bit imbecillic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with his wand she settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna) O, excuse!
基蒂：（用手捂着嘴咳嗽）她有点傻。 （她用摆动的食指签名）布莱姆。 （林奇用魔杖掀起她的裙子和白色衬裙，她很快就把它们安顿下来。）尊重自己。 （她打了个嗝，然后迅速弯下她的水手帽，帽子下她的头发因指甲花而闪闪发亮）哦，对不起！

ZOE: More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock)
佐伊：更引人注目，查理。 （她走到枝形吊灯前，打开煤气开关）

KITTY: (Peers at the gasjet) What ails it tonight?
基蒂：（盯着燃气喷射机）今晚怎么了？

LYNCH: (Deeply) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.
林奇：（深深地）鬼魂和妖精登场。

ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.
佐伊：为佐伊拍拍背。

(The wand in Lynch’s hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)
（林奇手中的魔杖闪烁：一把黄铜拨火棍。史蒂芬站在钢琴前，钢琴上铺满了他的帽子和梣木。他用两根手指再次重复了一系列空五度。弗洛里·塔尔博特，一个金发碧眼、瘦弱的鹅脂妓女，穿着一件破烂的破烂长袍。发霉的草莓，懒洋洋地躺在沙发角上，她柔软的前臂垂在抱枕上，听着。沉重的麦粒肿垂在她昏昏欲睡的眼睑上。）

KITTY: (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot) O, excuse!
基蒂：（马脚一踢，又打嗝了）哦，对不起！

ZOE: (Promptly) Your boy’s thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.
佐伊：（立即）你的男孩在想你。在你的班服上打个结。

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)
（凯蒂·里基茨低下头。她的蟒蛇展开，滑行，滑过她的肩膀、背部、手臂、椅子到地面。林奇举起魔杖上卷曲的毛毛虫。她蜿蜒着脖子，依偎着。斯蒂芬向后看了一眼蹲着的人影其帽子向后朝前。）

STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet’s rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David’s that is Circe’s or what am I saying Ceres’ altar and David’s tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his almightiness. Mais nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch’s cap, smiles, laughs) Which side is your knowledge bump?
斯蒂芬：事实上，贝内代托·马塞洛是否发现或制造了它并不重要。仪式是诗人的休息。它可能是一首献给得墨忒耳的古老赞美诗，也可能是科拉对多米尼的荣耀的说明。它很容易受到像超弗里吉亚语和混合利迪亚语这样相距甚远的节点或模式的影响，也容易受到像祭司们在大卫的祭坛上呼喊的文本如此不同的影响，那就是喀耳刻的祭坛，或者我在说什么谷神星的祭坛和大卫从马厩向他的首席巴松管演奏者透露的有关他的音乐的好坏的提示。全能。 Mais nom de nom，那是另一条裤子。 Jetez la 美食。 Faut que jeunesse se passe。 （他停了下来，指着林奇的帽子，微笑着）你的知识凹凸在哪一边？

THE CAP: (With saturnine spleen) Bah! It is because it is. Woman’s reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!
帽子：（阴沉的脾气）呸！这是因为它是。女人的理由。犹太人希腊语是希腊犹太人。极端相遇。死亡是生命的最高形式。呸!

STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!
史蒂芬：你相当准确地记得我所有的错误、自夸和错误。我还要对不忠视而不见多久？磨石！

THE CAP: Bah!
帽子：呸！

STEPHEN: Here’s another for you. (He frowns) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which …
史蒂芬：这是给你的另一个。 （皱眉）原因是因为基本音和主导音之间间隔了尽可能大的距离……

THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can’t.
帽子：哪个？结束。你不能。

STEPHEN: (With an effort) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.
斯蒂芬：（努力地）间隔哪个。是最大可能的椭圆。是一致的。最终的回报。八度。哪个。

THE CAP: Which?
帽子：哪个？

(Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)
（留声机外开始播放《圣城》的歌声。）

STEPHEN: (Abruptly) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow’s noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!
斯蒂芬：（突然）那些走到世界尽头不是为了穿越它自己的东西，上帝、太阳、莎士比亚、一个商业旅行者，在现实中穿越过它自己，就变成了那个自我。稍等。等一下。该死的那个家伙在街上发出的噪音。它本身不可避免地成为了自我。爱可！

LYNCH: (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins) What a learned speech, eh?
林奇：（带着嘲讽的笑声，对着布鲁姆和佐伊·希金斯微笑）多么有学问的演讲啊，嗯？

ZOE: (Briskly) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.
佐伊：（轻快地）上帝保佑你的头脑，他知道的比你忘记的还要多。

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)
（弗洛里·塔尔博特带着肥胖的愚蠢看着斯蒂芬。）

FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.
弗洛里：他们说今年夏天的最后一天即将到来。

KITTY: No!
凯蒂：不！

ZOE: (Explodes in laughter) Great unjust God!
佐伊：（大笑起来）伟大的不公正的上帝！

FLORRY: (Offended) Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O, my foot’s tickling.
弗洛里：（被冒犯了）嗯，报纸上有关于反基督者的报道。哦，我的脚痒痒的。

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past, yelling.)
（衣衫褴褛的赤脚报童，慢跑着鹡鸰风筝，拍打着过去，大喊大叫。）

THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.
报童：停止新闻版。摇马比赛的结果。皇家运河中的海蛇。敌基督者安全抵达。

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)
（斯蒂芬转身看到了布鲁姆。）

STEPHEN: A time, times and half a time.
史蒂芬：一次、几次、半次。

(Reuben I Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim’s wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)
（反基督者鲁本一世，流浪的犹太人，一只手紧握着他的脊椎，向前迈步。他的腰上挂着一个朝圣者的钱包，里面有期票和不兑现的钞票。他的肩上高高地扛着一根长船竿，船竿的钩子上挂着一根长船竿。他唯一的儿子从利菲水域中被救出来，湿漉漉的，蜷缩成一团，挂在裤子的松弛处。庞奇·科斯特洛形象中的大妖精，臀部中弹，驼背，脑积水，下颌前缩，前额后缩，鼻子像艾莉·斯洛普，在翻筋斗中翻滚着黑暗正在聚集。）

ALL: What?
全体：什么？

THE HOBGOBLIN: (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs) Il vient! C’est moi! L’homme qui rit! L’homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux sont faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks) Rien va plus! (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)
大怪怪：（他的下巴打颤，来回跳跃，瞪着眼睛，吱吱作响，张开紧抓着的手臂像袋鼠一样跳动，然后突然将他那张没有嘴唇的脸从大腿分叉处伸出）I vient！这就是我！ L'homme qui rit！原始人！ （他旋转着，旋转着，发出苦行僧的嚎叫）先生们和女士们，faites vos jeux！ （他蹲下来玩杂耍。小小的轮盘赌行星从他手中飞出。）Les jeux sont faits！ （行星冲在一起，发出嘎吱嘎吱的爆裂声）Rien va plus！ （行星、有浮力的气球、膨胀起来的帆消失了。他跳进了真空。）

FLORRY: (Sinking into torpor, crossing herself secretly) The end of the world!
弗洛里：（陷入麻木，偷偷在胸前画十字）世界末日！

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)
（一股女性温热的臭味从她身上漏出来。朦胧的朦胧占据了空间。穿过飘动的雾气，没有留声机的刺耳声和咳嗽声，也没有拖着脚步的声音。）

THE GRAMOPHONE: Jerusalem!
留声机：耶路撒冷！

Open your gates and sing
打开你的门，唱歌

Hosanna …
和撒那…

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star fills from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tightrope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a twoheaded octopus in gillie’s kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the form of the Three Legs of Man.)
（一枚火箭冲上天空，爆炸。其中充满了一颗白色的星星，宣告了万物的圆满和以利亚的第二次降临。沿着一条无限无形的钢丝，从天顶拉紧到天底，吉莉的双头章鱼短裙、巴斯比和格子呢长裙，在黑暗中旋转，神魂颠倒，以人的三条腿的形式。）

THE END OF THE WORLD: (with a Scotch accent) Wha’ll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?
世界末日：（带有苏格兰口音）谁会跳龙骨划船，龙骨划船，龙骨划船？

(Over the possing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah’s voice, harsh as a corncrake’s, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergerfaced, above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)
（在飘散的气流和令人窒息的呼吸声中，伊利亚的声音像秧鸡的声音一样刺耳，在高处刺耳。人们看到他穿着漏斗袖的宽松草坪法衣，大汗淋漓，面容严肃，站在讲台上，讲台上挂着古老荣耀的旗帜。他重击栏杆。）

ELIJAH: No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dove Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God’s time is 12.25. Tell mother you’ll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here. Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it’s up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It’s a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It’s the whole pie with jam in. It’s just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and, getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O. K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That’s it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings) Jeru …
ELIJAH：请不要在这个展位上大声喧哗。 Jake Crane、Creole Sue、Dove Campbell、Abe Kirschner，请闭上嘴咳嗽。假设，我正在操作所有这条干线。男孩们，现在就做吧。上帝的时间是12.25。告诉妈妈你会在那里。赶紧下订单，你就能打出一张圆滑的王牌。就在这里加入吧。预订直达永恒路口的直达航班。就再多说一个字吧。你是神还是狗屎？如果第二次降临来到康尼岛，我们准备好了吗？ Florry Christ、Stephen Christ、Zoe Christ、Bloom Christ、Kitty Christ、Lynch Christ，由你来感受宇宙力量。我们对宇宙退缩了吗？不，要站在天使一边。成为一个棱镜。你内在有某种东西，更高的自我。你可以与耶稣、乔达摩、英格索尔并肩。你们都在这个振动中吗？我说你是。一旦你崇尚这一点，会众，去天堂的雄心壮志就变成了一个过时的数字。你抓到我了吗？当然，它是一种生活增光剂。有史以来最热门的东西。这是整个馅饼加了果酱。这只是最可爱、最活泼的线条。它是巨大的、超级奢华的。它恢复了。它振动。我知道，我是一个振动器。开个玩笑，言归正传，A.J. Christ Dowie 和和谐哲学，你明白了吗？好的，西六十九街七十七号。明白我了吗？就是这样。以前你总是用日光电话给我打电话。笨蛋们，保存好你们的邮票吧。 （他喊道）现在是我们的荣耀之歌。大家都热情地投入到歌声中。安可！ （他唱）耶鲁……

THE GRAMOPHONE: (Drowning his voice) Whorusalaminyourhighhohhhh … (The disc rasps gratingly against the needle)
留声机：（压低声音）Whorusalaminyourhighhohhhh……（唱片在唱针上发出刺耳的刺耳声）

THE THREE WHORES: (Covering their ears, squawk) Ahhkkk!
三个妓女：（捂住耳朵，尖叫）啊啊啊啊！

ELIJAH: (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don’t never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he aint saying nothing.
以利亚：（卷起衬衫袖子，脸色发黑，高举双臂，高声喊道）老大哥，总统先生，你听到我刚才对你说的话了。当然，总统先生，我对你有很大的信心。我当然在想，希金斯小姐和里基茨小姐现在已经把宗教融入了他们的内心。当然，在我看来，我从来没有见过比你这样的女人更害怕的女人了，弗洛里小姐，刚才我给你做种了。总统先生，您来了，帮我拯救我们亲爱的姐妹。 （他向观众挤眉弄眼）我们的总统先生，他把所有事情都说了一遍，但他什么也没说。

KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in the brown scapular. My mother’s sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.
凯蒂-凯特：我忘记了我自己。在脆弱的时刻，我犯了错误，做了我在宪法山所做的事情。我得到了主教的确认，并入读了棕色肩胛。我母亲的姐姐嫁给了蒙莫朗西家族。当我纯洁的时候，一个工作的水管工毁了我。

ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.
佐伊-范妮：我让他把它拉到我身上只是为了好玩。

FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy’s three star. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.
FLORRY-TERESA：这是轩尼诗三星级之上的波特酒饮料的结果。当惠兰滑进床上时，我对他感到内疚。

STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.
史蒂芬：一开始就有这个词，最后世界没有尽头。八福受福。

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students’ gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fist past in noisy marching)
（迪克森、马登、克罗瑟斯、科斯特洛、莱内汉、班农、穆里根和林奇身穿白色外科学生长袍，四人并排，正步、捶拳，喧闹地行进着）

THE BEATITUDES: (Incoherently) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.
福音：（语无伦次）啤酒牛肉斗狗 buybull Businum barnum buggerum bishop。

LYSTER: (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.
莱斯特：（穿着灰色及膝裤，戴着宽边帽，谨慎地说）他是我们的朋友。我不需要提及名字。你去寻求光明吧。

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser’s attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin’s kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizardlettered, and a high pagoda hat.)
（他快步走过。贝斯特穿着理发师的服装，洗得锃亮的，头发上包着卷发纸。他带头的是约翰·埃格林顿，约翰·埃格林顿穿着南基黄色的中式和服，上面有蜥蜴字，戴着一顶高高的宝塔帽。）

BEST: (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot) I was just beautifying him, don’t you know. A thing of beauty, don’t you know, Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.
BEST：（微笑着，举起帽子，展示一头剃光的头发，头顶上竖着一顶辫子假发，扎着橙色的顶髻）我只是在美化他，你不知道吗？叶芝说，或者我的意思是，济慈说，这是美丽的事物，你不知道吗？

JOHN EGLINTON: (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner: with carping accent) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.
约翰·埃格林顿（JOHN EGLINTON）：（拿出一盏绿顶黑灯笼，朝角落闪烁：带着吹毛求疵的口音）美容和化妆品是为闺房准备的。我追求真理。对于一个普通人来说，这是简单的真理。 Tanderagee 想要了解事实以及获得这些事实的方法。

(In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaun Maclir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)
（在煤斗后面的探照灯锥体中，奥拉夫，双眼神圣，留着胡须的马纳南·麦克利尔沉思着，下巴放在膝盖上。他慢慢地站起来。一股寒冷的海风从他德鲁伊的嘴里吹来。鳗鱼和精灵在他的头上扭动着。他是身上长满了杂草和贝壳，右手拿着自行车打气筒，左手用两只爪子抓着一只巨大的小龙虾。）

MANANAUN MACLIR: (With a voice of waves) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won’t have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds) Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its cooperative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead! I am the dreamery creamery butter.
MANANAUN MACLIR：（声音如波浪般）嗯！哎呀！沃尔！好的！卢布！莫尔！嘛！众神的白色瑜伽士。赫尔墨斯·特里斯墨吉斯托斯的神秘调情者。 （伴随着海风呼啸的声音）Punarjanam patsypunjaub！我不会被拉我的腿。有人说过：当心左派，即对萨克蒂的崇拜。 （伴随着风暴鸟的叫声）Shakti Shiva，黑暗隐藏的父亲！ （他用自行车打气筒敲打左手上的小龙虾。它配合的表盘上闪烁着黄道带的十二个星座。他用大海般的激烈声号哭。） 嗯！鲍姆！睡衣！我是家园之光！我是梦幻般的奶油黄油。

(A skeleton judashand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)
（一具犹太骷髅扼杀了光芒。绿光逐渐减弱为紫红色。燃气喷射机发出呼啸声。）

THE GASJET: Pooah! Pfuiiiiiii!
燃气喷射机：呸！噗噗噗！

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)
（佐伊跑到枝形吊灯前，弯曲腿，调整斗篷。）

ZOE: Who has a fag as I’m here?
ZOE：我在这里谁有同性恋？

LYNCH: (Tossing a cigarette on to the table) Here.
林奇：（把香烟扔到桌子上）这里。

ZOE: (Her head perched aside in mock pride) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie’s green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beautyspot of my behind?
佐伊：（她的头靠在一边，假装骄傲）这是把锅递给女士的方式吗？ （她伸直身子，在火焰上点燃香烟，慢慢地转动它，露出她腋下的棕色毛簇。林奇用拨火棍大胆地抬起她衬衣的一侧。从她的吊袜带上裸露的肉体出现在蓝宝石下，呈现出水妖的绿色。 ……她平静地吸了一口烟。）你能看到我背后的美丽点吗？

LYNCH: I’m not looking
林奇：我没看

ZOE: (Makes sheep’s eyes) No? You wouldn’t do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?
ZOE：（做羊眼）没有？你不会做更少的事情。你会吸柠檬吗？

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O’connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)
（她假装羞愧地眯起眼睛，用斜视的方式瞥了布卢姆一眼，然后转身朝他走去，将她的衬裙从拨火棍中拉出来。蓝色的液体再次流过她的肉。布卢姆站着，渴望地微笑着，转动着他的拇指。基蒂·里基茨舔着她的中部用手指吐出唾沫，凝视着镜子，抚平双眉。利波蒂·维拉格，巴西利格拉姆，迅速从烟囱中滑落，踩着笨拙的粉红色高跷向左走了两步。他被套在几件大衣里，里面穿着一件棕色的麦金托什帽。他手里拿着一卷羊皮纸。他的左眼闪现出卡舍尔·博伊尔·奥康纳·菲茨莫里斯·蒂斯达尔·法雷尔的单片眼镜。他的头上栖息着一支埃及短剑。两根羽毛笔伸出在他的耳朵上。）

VIRAG: (Heels together, bows) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.
VIRAG：（并拢，鞠躬）我叫 Virag Lipoti，来自松博特海伊。 （他若有所思地干咳）这里到处都是乱七八糟的裸体，是吗？不经意间，她的背影揭示了一个事实：她并没有穿着那些你特别喜欢的相当私密的衣服。大腿上的注射痕迹我希望你看到了吗？好的。

BLOOM: Granpapachi. But …
布鲁姆：格兰帕帕奇。但 …

VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
维拉格：另一方面，我认为，第二个，她的樱桃红和白色的发型，她的头发很大程度上归功于我们部落的歌斐木长生不老药，她穿着步行服装，紧紧地坐在她的座位上，我认为。可以说，骨干在前面。纠正我的说法，但我一直明白，由不安的人类瞥见内衣所进行的行为因其暴露癖而吸引了你。总之。鹰头马身有翼兽。我对吗？

BLOOM: She is rather lean.
布鲁姆：她很瘦。

VIRAG: (Not unpleasantly) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
维拉格：（并非不愉快）当然！仔细观察，裙子的裙袋和轻微的挂钩效果旨在暗示臀部的束状。在某个怪物特卖会上新买的东西，里面有一只海鸥。华丽的华服欺骗眼睛。观察对尘粒细节的关注。今天可以穿的衣服永远不要明天穿。视差！ （他的头紧张地抽搐）你听到我的大脑崩溃了吗？多音节！

BLOOM: (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek) She seems sad.
布鲁姆：（手肘放在手上，食指抵着脸颊）她看起来很伤心。

VIRAG: (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor’s button discovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
维拉格：（愤世嫉俗地，他黄鼠狼般的牙齿露出黄色，用一根手指拉下他的左眼，嘶哑地吠叫）骗局！谨防轻佻和假哀。巷子里的百合。所有人都拥有鲁尔杜斯·哥伦布发现的单身汉纽扣。摔倒她。挫败她。变色龙。 （更加和蔼地）那么，请允许我提请您注意第三项。她有很多肉眼可见的地方。观察她头骨上大量的含氧植物物质。哎呀，她撞了！派对上的丑小鸭，长长的，深深地扎在龙骨里。

BLOOM: (Regretfully) When you come out without your gun.
布卢姆：（遗憾地）当你出来时没有带枪。

VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either …
VIRAG：我们可以为您提供所有品牌，轻度、中度和强力。交钱，你自己选择。和其中任何一个在一起你会多么幸福……

BLOOM: With …?
布鲁姆：与……？

VIRAG: (His tongue upcurling) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation, which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches) Slapbang! There he goes again.
维拉格：（舌头上翘）Lyum！看。她的光束很宽阔。她身上覆盖着相当多的脂肪层。显然是哺乳动物，你注意到她的胸部重量很明显，她的前面有两个尺寸非常可观的突起，倾向于落在正午的汤盘中，而在她的下方有两个额外的突起，暗示着强大的直肠和肿胀的触诊，除了紧凑性外，没有什么可挑剔的。这样的肉质部分是精心培育的产物。当共同饲养时，它们的肝脏会达到大象般的大小。含有芬尼希腊和口香糖的新面包颗粒，被绿茶药水淹没，使它们在短暂的存在期间拥有相当巨大的鲸脂的天然针垫。这很适合你的书，是吗？令人垂涎的埃及肉锅。沉迷其中。石松属。 （喉咙抽动）啪啪啪！他又去了那里。

BLOOM: The stye I dislike.
布鲁姆：我不喜欢麦粒肿。

VIRAG: (Arches his eyebrows) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve’s sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches) It is a funny sound. (He coughs encouragingly) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
维拉格：（拱起眉毛）他们说，与金戒指接触过。正如我们在古罗马和古希腊的梁龙和鱼龙担任执政官时所说的那样。对于其余的事情，夏娃的至高无上的补救措施。不作为产品销售。只雇用。胡格诺派。 （他抽搐）这是一个有趣的声音。 （他鼓励地咳嗽）但这可能只是一个疣。我想你应该记得我在这方面教给你的东西吧？小麦粉加蜂蜜和肉豆蔻。

BLOOM: (Reflecting) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said …
布卢姆：（思考）带有石松和音节的小麦粉。这种寻找的磨难。这是异常疲惫的一天，也是充满意外的一天。等待。我的意思是，疣血会传播疣，你说……

VIRAG: (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside) He will surely remember.
维拉格：（严肃地，他的鼻子硬邦邦的，他的侧眼眨着）别再转动你的拇指了，来一声好听的“重击”吧。你看，你已经忘记了。锻炼你的记忆术。 La causa è santa。塔拉.塔拉. （旁白）他一定会记得的。

BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?
布鲁姆：我理解你所说的迷迭香还有对寄生组织的意志力。那么不，不，我有一个暗示。死手的触摸可以治愈。姆尼莫？

VIRAG: (Excitedly) I say so. I say so. E’en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively) Keekeereekee!
维拉格：（兴奋地）我是这么说的。我这么说。是这样的。技术。 （他用力敲击羊皮纸卷）这本书告诉你如何根据所有描述性细节采取行动。附子烦躁恐惧，白头翁忧郁，参见索引。维拉格将谈论截肢手术。我们的老朋友腐蚀性。他们一定是饿坏了。用马毛从凹陷的脖子下面剪掉。但是，把地点换到保加利亚和巴斯克，你已经决定好还是不喜欢穿男性服装的女性了吗？ （干笑）你打算用一整年的时间来研究宗教问题，并在 1886 年的夏季几个月里完成任务并赢得那一百万。石榴！从崇高到荒诞不过一步之遥。睡衣，让我们说？或者是闭合的长袜角撑内裤？或者，就我们的情况而言，那些复杂的组合，camiknickers？ （他嘲笑地叫起来）咳咳咳咳！

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)
（布鲁姆不确定地打量了三个妓女，然后凝视着笼罩着的紫红色光芒，聆听着飞蛾的飞翔声。）

BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then morrow as now was be past yester.
布鲁姆：我当时想现在就结束了。睡衣从来都不是。因此。但明天又将是新的一天。过去就是今天。现在的事情明天也会发生，就像昨天的事情一样。

VIRAG: (Prompts in a pig’s whisper) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous fumale possessing extendified pudendal nerve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear’s buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! (He blows into bloom’s ear) Buzz!
维拉格：（用猪耳语提示）当今的昆虫在短暂的存在中反复交配，被背部区域拥有延伸的阴部神经的下等美丽的雌性的气味所引诱。漂亮的民意调查！ （他的黄色鹦鹉嘴用鼻音叽叽喳喳）大约在我们这个时代的五千五百五十年，喀尔巴阡山脉有一句谚语。一汤匙蜂蜜可以吸引朋友布鲁因超过六桶首选麦芽醋。熊的嗡嗡声困扰着蜜蜂。但除此之外。我们可能会在另一个时间继续。我们和其他人都非常高兴。 （他咳嗽，弯下眉头，若有所思地用勺子揉鼻子）你会发现这些夜虫是追随光的。记住他们复杂的、不可调节的眼睛的错觉。对于所有这些棘手的问题，请参阅我的《性学基础或爱情激情》的第十七本书，L.B.说的是今年的轰动一书。例如，有些人的动作是自动的。感知。那才是他合适的阳光。夜鸟夜日夜城。追我吧，查理！ （他对着布卢姆的耳朵吹气）嗡嗡！

BLOOM: Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I …
布卢姆：前几天，蜜蜂或青蝇也撞到了墙上的影子，我自己都晕了，然后我就迷迷糊糊地闲逛了，干得好，我……

VIRAG: (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm’s nose running backwards over the letters which he claws) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I’m the best o’cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags his head with cackling raillery) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. (He sneezes) Amen!
维拉格：（面无表情，以浓郁的女性调笑）太棒了！西班牙蝇在他的苍蝇上或芥末膏在他的小口上。 （他狼吞虎咽地吃着火鸡肉垂）活泼的运动员！活泼的运动员！我们在哪里？芝麻开门！出来了！ （他迅速展开羊皮纸，读起来，萤火虫的鼻子向后跑过他抓着的字母）留下来，好朋友。我给你带来你的答案。红岸牡蛎很快就会到货。我是最好的厨师。那些多汁的双壳类动物可能对我们有帮助，而佩里戈尔的松露，即通过杂食性猪肉先生移出的块茎，对于神经衰弱或病毒炎的情况是无与伦比的。虽然它们很臭，但它们却很刺痛。 （他摇着头，咯咯地笑着）开玩笑。我的眼镜在我的眼睛里。 （他打喷嚏）阿门！

BLOOM: (Absently) Ocularly woman’s bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman’s milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.
布卢姆：（心不在焉地）从视觉上看，女性的双壳类病例更严重。永远是芝麻开门。分裂的性别。为什么他们害怕害虫、爬行动物。然而夏娃和蛇是矛盾的。不是历史事实。与我的想法有明显的类比。蛇也很贪吃女人的奶。他们蜿蜒穿过数英里的杂食性森林，吸干她多汁的乳房。就像人们在《象形虫病》中读到的那些活泼开朗的罗马主妇一样。

VIRAG: (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the the known …
维拉格：（他的嘴上浮现出坚硬的皱纹，眼睛冷漠地闭着，用古怪的单调吟诵着赞美诗）那些有着肿胀乳房的奶牛，它们是众所周知的……

BLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian’s lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.
布鲁姆：我要尖叫了。请再说一遍。啊？所以。 （他重复）自发地寻找蜥蜴的巢穴，以便将它们的乳头托付给它的贪婪的吸力。蚂蚁给蚜虫挤奶。 （深刻地）本能统治着世界。在生活中。在死亡中。

VIRAG: (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wingshoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a horning claw and cries) Who’s moth moth? Who’s dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is Gerald. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews) Puss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw) Well, well. He doth rest anon. (he snaps his jaws suddenly on the air)
维拉格：（歪着头，弓起背，耸起翼肩，用凸出的眼睛盯着飞蛾，用角爪指着飞蛾，喊道）谁是飞蛾？亲爱的杰拉德是谁？亲爱的格尔，是你吗？哦，亲爱的，他是杰拉尔德。哦，我非常担心他会被烧得很严重。现在是否有人会阻止灾难性的事件，从而避免一级餐桌上的骚动？ （他喵喵叫）猫猫猫猫猫！ （叹了口气，退后一步，下巴下垂，斜视着下方）好吧，好吧。他马上就休息了。 （他突然在空中张开下巴）

THE MOTH:
飞蛾：

I’m a tiny tiny thing
我是一个微小的小东西

Ever flying in the spring
永远飞翔在春天

Round and round a ringaring.
一圈又一圈的铃声。

Long ago I was a king
很久以前我是一个国王

Now I do this kind of thing
现在我做这种事

On the wing, on the wing!
在机翼上，在机翼上！

Bing!
宾！

（他冲向紫红色的阴影，拍打着吵闹的声音）相当相当相当相当相当相当相当相当漂亮的衬裙。

(From left upper entrance with two gliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacob’s pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour’s face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)
（亨利·弗劳尔从左上入口迈着两步滑步来到左前中央。他身穿深色斗篷，戴着下垂的羽毛宽边帽。他拿着一把银弦镶嵌扬琴和一支长柄竹制雅各布笛，其粘土碗形状为女性头像。他穿着深色天鹅绒长筒袜和银扣高跟鞋。他有着浪漫的救世主般的脸庞，飘逸的头发，稀疏的胡须和小胡子。他的纺锤腿和麻雀脚是男高音马里奥，坎迪亚王子的。他安顿起褶边，润湿嘴唇。伴随着他多情的舌头。）

HENRY: (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar) There is a flower that bloometh.
亨利：（用低沉悦耳的声音，抚摸着吉他弦）有一朵花正在绽放。

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe’s neck. Henry gallant turns with pendant dewlap to the piano.)
（维拉格好斗，下巴紧闭，盯着灯。格雷夫·布鲁姆看着佐伊的脖子。亨利英勇地转向钢琴，垂下垂下的赘肉。）

STEPHEN: (To himself) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I’m partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.
斯蒂芬：（自言自语）闭着眼睛玩。模仿吧。用猪壳填饱肚子。这个太多了。我会起来，走向我的。期待的是这个。史蒂夫，你的行为很危险。必须拜访老迪西或电报。今天上午的采访给我留下了深刻的印象。尽管我们的年龄。明天就写完整。顺便说一句，我已经喝醉了。 （他再次触碰琴键）现在小调和弦来了。是的。不过不多。

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)
（阿尔米达诺·阿蒂福尼（Almidano Artifoni）留着浓密的小胡子，手里拿着音乐棒。）

FLORRY: Sing us something. Love’s old sweet song.
弗洛里：给我们唱点歌吧。爱情的古老甜蜜歌曲。

STEPHEN: No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?
史蒂芬：没有声音。我是一位最完美的艺术家。林奇，我给你看了那封关于鲁特琴的信吗？

FLORRY: (Smirking) The bird that can sing and won’t sing.
弗洛里：（傻笑）会唱歌和不会唱歌的鸟。

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober, two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold’s face.)
（连体双胞胎菲利普·德朗克（Philip Drunk）和菲利普·索伯（Philip Sober）是牛津大学的两位教授，他们都拿着割草机，出现在窗户的射孔中。两人的脸上都蒙着马修·阿诺德的脸。）

PHILIP SOBER: Take a fool’s advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney’s en ville, Mooney’s sur mer, the Moira, Larchet’s, Holles street hospital, Burke’s. Eh? I am watching you.
菲利普·索伯：听听傻瓜的建议吧。一切都不好。像一个年轻的白痴一样，用铅笔头把它算出来。你得到了三英镑十二英镑、两张纸币、一张金镑、两克朗，如果年轻人知道的话。穆尼维尔医院、穆尼滨海医院、莫伊拉医院、拉谢特医院、霍尔斯街医院、伯克医院。呃？我注视着你。

PHILIP DRUNK: (Impatiently) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name? (His lawnmower begins to purr) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere. Mac Somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?
PHILIP DRUNK：（不耐烦地）啊，波什，伙计。去死吧！我付了路费。如果我只能了解八度就好了。人格的重复。是谁告诉我他的名字的？ （他的割草机开始发出咕噜声）啊哈，是的。佐伊·穆·萨斯·阿加波。有一个想法我以前来过这里。我什么时候在某处没有阿特金森的名片。麦克某人。解锁我有它。他告诉我，等一下，斯威本，是吗？

FLORRY: And the song?
弗洛里：那首歌呢？

STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
斯蒂芬：精神愿意，但肉体却很软弱。

FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? You’re like someone I knew once.
弗洛里：你是从梅努斯出来的吗？你就像我曾经认识的一个人。

STEPHEN: Out of it now. (To himself) Clever.
史蒂芬：现在就出去吧。 （自言自语）聪明。

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER: (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms) Clever ever. Out of it out of it. By the bye have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.
菲利普喝醉了，菲利普清醒了：（他们的割草机发出咕噜咕噜的声音）非常聪明。脱离它脱离它。再见，你有那本书、那个东西、那棵白蜡树吗？是的，就在那里，是的。聪明的现在。保持状态。喜欢我们。

ZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn’t try to hide, I says to him. I know you’ve a Roman collar.
佐伊：两天前的晚上，这里有一位牧师，他扣紧外套的扣子，在这儿做他的事。你不必试图隐藏，我对他说。我知道你有罗马领。

VIRAG: Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why I left the church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man’s lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grapses woman’s wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman’s fat yadgana. (He chases his tail) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes) Pchp! (He worries his butt) Prrrrrht!
VIRAG：从他的角度来看，这是完全合乎逻辑的。人的堕落。 （严厉地，他的瞳孔逐渐放大）让教皇见鬼去吧！阳光下并无新鲜事。我是揭露僧侣和少女性秘密的维拉格。为什么我离开罗马教会。阅读《神父、女人和忏悔录》。彭罗斯。弗利珀蒂·吉珀特。 （他蠕动）女人带着甜美的脓液解开她的灯心草腰带，将她湿润的阴户献给男人的林伽。不久之后，男人向女人赠送了丛林肉块。女人表现出喜悦并用羽毛皮盖住自己。男人用大而僵硬的大林伽猛烈地爱着她的阴户。 （他哭了）Coactus volui。然后头晕的女人就会跑来跑去。强壮的男人抓住女人的手腕。女人尖叫、咬伤、呕吐。男人现在非常愤怒，击打女人肥胖的Yadgana。 （追着尾巴）噗噗！波波！ （他停下来，打喷嚏）Pchp！ （他担心他的屁股）Prrrrrt！

LYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.
林奇：我希望你给这位好父亲一个忏悔。射杀主教可获九格洛里亚。

ZOE: (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils) He couldn’t get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM: Poor man!
布鲁姆：可怜的人！

ZOE: (Lightly) Only for what happened him.
佐伊：（轻声地）只是为了他所发生的事情。

BLOOM: How?
布鲁姆：怎么办？

VIRAG: (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the pope’s bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.
维拉格：（恶魔般的黑色光辉收缩了他的面容，向前伸长了他那条瘦削的脖子。他举起了月亮般的喷嘴，嚎叫着。）Verfluchte Goim！他有一个父亲，四十个父亲。他从未存在过。猪神啊！他有两只左脚。他就是犹大·亚基亚 (Judas Iacchia)，利比亚太监，教皇的私生子。 （他靠在饱受折磨的前爪上，肘部僵硬地弯曲，他的眼睛在平坦的颅骨上痛苦不堪，对着无声的世界大喊）一个妓女的儿子。启示录。

KITTY: And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn’t swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.
基蒂：玛丽·肖托尔（Mary Shortall）因戴蓝色帽子的吉米·皮金（Jimmy Pidgeon）感染了痘而被关在锁里，他的一个孩子无法吞咽，因床垫抽搐而窒息，我们都参加了葬礼。

PHILIP DRUNK: (Gravely) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?
菲利普醉酒：（严肃地）你的位置不对吗，菲利普？

PHILIP SOBER: (Gaily) c’était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.
菲利普·索伯：（高兴地）这是神圣的鸽子，菲利普。

（基蒂解开帽子，平静地放下，拍拍她的指甲花头发。妓女的肩膀上从来没有见过更漂亮、更精致的迷人卷发。林奇戴上帽子。她把它摘下来。）

林奇：（笑）梅奇尼科夫为类人猿接种了疫苗，这让他非常高兴。

佐伊：（高兴地）哦，我的字典。

LYNCH: Three wise virgins.
林奇：三个聪明的童女。

VIRAG: (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon’s cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!
维拉格：（阿格颤抖着，大量的黄色虫子在他那瘦骨嶙峋、癫痫般的嘴唇上冒着泡沫）她卖爱情药、白蜡、橙花。罗马百夫长黑豹用他的生殖器玷污了她。 （他伸出闪烁着磷光的蝎子舌头，手放在叉子上）弥赛亚！他戳破了她的鼓膜。 （伴随着狒狒胡言乱语的叫声，他愤世嫉俗地抽搐着臀部）希克！哎呀！哈！霍克！哈克！角！咕咕！

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, Rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN DOLLARD: (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone) When love absorbs my ardent soul.
本·多拉德（BEN DOLLARD）：（用他那巨大的带衬垫的爪子敲打响板骨头，用基调的桶音欢快地唱着约德尔歌）当爱吸收了我热情的灵魂时。

维拉格：（脱掉他的皮，换掉大量的羽毛）老鼠！ （他打了个哈欠，露出煤黑的喉咙，向上一推羊皮纸卷，闭上了嘴）说完我就走了。告别。再见。德雷克！

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cow’s lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door, his wild harp slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)
（亨利·弗劳尔用一把袖珍梳子快速地梳理着他的小胡子和胡须，并用牛舔了舔他的头发。他用细剑引导着，滑向门口，他的野竖琴挂在他身后。维拉格用两只笨拙的高跷到达门口，他的尾巴翘起，灵巧地把一只淡黄色的飞嘴拍到墙上，用头撞它。）

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN: (Over his shoulder to zoe) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.
斯蒂芬：（转头对佐伊）你会更喜欢那个创立新教错误的战斗牧师。但要小心狗圣人安提斯泰尼和阿里乌斯·赫雷西亚库斯的最后结局。衣柜里的痛苦。

斯蒂芬：大罪。螺丝僧。

(His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:)
（全爱尔兰的大主教西蒙·斯蒂芬·红衣主教戴达勒斯阁下，出现在门口，穿着红色苏丹、凉鞋和袜子。七个矮人猿侍僧，也穿着红色的大罪服，扶着他的裙裾，在裙裾下偷看。他穿着一件头上戴着一顶破旧的丝绸帽子。他的拇指插在腋下，手掌张开。他的脖子上挂着一串软木念珠，末端在胸前呈螺旋形十字。松开拇指，他用大挥手祈求来自高处的恩典。用臃肿的排场做手势和宣告:)

（大量的蠓虫在他的长袍上飞舞。他双臂交叉，在肋骨处抓伤，做了个鬼脸，大声喊道：）

I’m suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they’d walk me off the face of the bloody globe.
我正在承受被诅咒者的痛苦。靠着做作的小提琴，感谢上帝，那些有趣的小家伙们并没有达成一致。如果他们是的话，他们就会把我从这个该死的地球表面带走。

(His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his trainbearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful male, melodious:)
（他歪着头，用食指和中指简短地祝福，传递复活节之吻，然后滑稽地拖着双脚走开，左右摇晃帽子，迅速缩小到火车夫的大小。矮人助手们咯咯地笑，偷看，轻推，凝视，复活节之吻，在他身后曲折。他的声音从远处传来醇厚，仁慈的男性，悠扬:)

Shall carry my heart to thee,
将把我的心带到你身边，

Shall carry my heart to thee,
将把我的心带到你身边，

And the breath of the balmy night
和和煦的夜晚的气息

Shall carry my heart to thee!
将把我的心带到你身边！

(The trick doorhandle turns.)
（诡计门把手转动。）

THE DOORHANDLE: Theeee!
门把手：哎呀！

ZOE: The devil is in that door.
佐伊：魔鬼就在那扇门里。

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)
（一个男性走下吱吱作响的楼梯，听到从架子上拿防水衣和帽子的声音。布卢姆不由自主地向前走去，在他经过时半关上门，从口袋里掏出巧克力，紧张地递给佐伊。）

ZOE: (Sniffs his hair briskly) Hmmm! Thank your mother for the rabbits. I’m very fond of what I like.
ZOE：（轻快地嗅着他的头发）嗯！谢谢你妈妈送来的兔子。我非常喜欢我喜欢的东西。

BLOOM: (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?
布鲁姆：（听到一个男声在门口与妓女交谈，竖起了耳朵）如果是他呢？后？或者因为没有？还是双重事件？

ZOE: (Tears open the silverfoil) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch!
ZOE：（撕开银箔）手指是在叉子之前制作的。 （她停下来，咬了一块，给了基蒂·里基茨一块，然后小猫般地转向林奇）不反对法国含片吗？ （他点点头。她嘲笑他。）现在就拿还是等到你拿到为止？ （他张开嘴，歪着头。她把奖品向左转了一圈。他的头跟着转。她又把它转回右转一圈。他看着她。）接住！

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)
（她扔了一块。他熟练地啪地一声接住了它，然后咬了一口。）

KITTY: (Chewing) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft’s hobbyhorses. I’m giddy still.
KITTY：（咀嚼）和我一起去集市的工程师确实有可爱的东西。充满了最好的利口酒。总督和他的夫人也在场。我们在托夫特的木马身上加的汽油。我还是头晕。

BLOOM: (In Svengali’s fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are!
布卢姆：（身穿斯文加利的毛皮大衣，双臂交叉，留着拿破仑式的刘海，皱着眉头，以腹语驱魔的方式，目光如鹰般锐利地望着门口。然后，他左脚僵硬地向前推进，手指急促地快速传球，做出了过去主人的手势，画着他的右臂从左肩向下。） 走，走，走，我召唤你，无论你是谁！

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Bloom’s features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)
（外面的雾气中传来男性的咳嗽声和脚步声。布鲁姆的表情放松下来。他将一只手放在背心里，摆出平静的姿势。佐伊给了他巧克力。）

BLOOM: (Solemnly) Thanks.
布鲁姆：（郑重地）谢谢。

ZOE: Do as you’re bid. Here!
佐伊：按照你的吩咐去做。这里！

(A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)
（楼梯上传来脚步声。）

BLOOM: (Takes the chocolate) Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But I bought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women’s characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.
布卢姆：（接过巧克力）春药？艾菊和彭尼罗。但我买了。香草平静还是？姆尼莫。混乱的光线会扰乱记忆。红色影响狼疮。颜色会影响女性的性格，无论她们有什么性格。这黑色让我感到悲伤。为明天吃喝玩乐。 （他吃）也影响味道，淡紫色。但我已经很久没有出现了。看起来很新鲜。阿芙罗。那个牧师。必须来。迟到总比不到好。在安德鲁斯品尝松露。

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted nostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)
（门打开了。贝拉·科恩，一个巨大的妓女走了进来。她穿着四分之三的象牙色长袍，下摆镶着流苏镶边，像《卡门》中的米妮·豪克一样，用黑喇叭扇子调情，让自己冷静下来。她的左手上是结婚戒指和守护戒指。她的眼睛深碳化。她的小胡子正在萌芽。她的橄榄色脸庞沉重，略带汗水，鼻孔饱满，鼻孔呈橙色。她戴着大号的绿柱石耳坠。）

BELLA: My word! I’m all of a mucksweat.
贝拉：我的话！我浑身都是汗。

(She glances round her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)
（她扫视周围的情侣。然后，她的目光坚定地落在布卢姆身上。她的大扇子将风吹向她滚烫的脸颈和骨尖。她的鹰眼闪闪发光。）

THE FAN: (Flirting quickly, then slowly) Married, I see.
粉丝：（快速调情，然后慢慢地）结婚了，我明白了。

BLOOM: Yes. Partly, I have mislaid …
布鲁姆：是的。部分原因是我遗失了……

THE FAN: (Half opening, then closing) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.
扇子：（半张开，然后合上）夫人是主人。衬裙政府。

BLOOM: (Looks down with a sheepish grin) That is so.
布卢姆：（低下头，羞涩地笑）是这样的。

THE FAN: (Folding together, rests against her left eardrop) Have you forgotten me?
扇子：（折叠起来，靠在左耳垂上）你忘记我了吗？

BLOOM: Yes. Yo.
布鲁姆：是的。哟。

THE FAN: (Folded akimbo against her waist) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we?
粉丝：（双手叉腰）我就是你之前梦到的那个人吗？那她就是你我们认识的那个人吗？他们和我们现在一样吗？

(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)
（贝拉走近，轻轻地用扇子敲打。）

BLOOM: (Wincing) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.
布卢姆：（皱眉）强大的存在。在我的眼里读到了女人所喜爱的睡眠。

THE FAN: (Tapping) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
粉丝：（轻拍）我们见过了。你是我的。这是命运。

BLOOM: (Cowed) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog’s spittle as you probably … (He winces) Ah!
布卢姆：（畏缩）精力充沛的女性。我非常渴望你的统治。我精疲力尽，被抛弃，不再年轻。可以这么说，我站在人类生活总邮局的太晚的信箱前，拿着一封未寄出的信，信上注明了额外的监管费。根据落体定律，以直角打开的门窗会产生每秒三十二英尺的气流。此刻我感到左侧臀肌有坐骨神经痛的刺痛。它在我们的家庭中流传。可怜的亲爱的爸爸，一个鳏夫，是它的一个定期晴雨表。他相信动物的热量。他的冬季背心上衬着一张虎斑猫皮。接近尾声时，为了纪念大卫王和苏南人，他与死后忠诚的阿多斯同床共枕。你可能是狗的唾沫……（他皱眉）啊！

RICHIE GOULDING: (Bagweighted, passes the door) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince’s. Liver and kidney.
里奇·古尔丁：（背负重担，穿过门）嘲笑是可以接受的。配音的最佳价值。适合王子的。肝脏和肾脏。

THE FAN: (Tapping) All things end. Be mine. Now,
风扇：（敲击声）一切都会结束。是我的。现在，

BLOOM: (Undecided) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
布鲁姆：（犹豫不决）现在就可以了吗？我不应该放弃我的护身符。下雨，暴露在海岩上的露珠上，这是我一生中的一个小过失。每一种现象都有其自然原因。

THE FAN: (Points downwards slowly) You may.
风扇：（慢慢地向下指）可以。

BLOOM: (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace) We are observed.
布卢姆：（低头一看，发现她的鞋带没有系紧）我们被观察到了。

THE FAN: (Points downwards quickly) You must.
风扇：（快速向下指）你必须这么做。

BLOOM: (With desire, with reluctance) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellett’s. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!
布鲁姆：（带着渴望，带着不情愿）我可以打一个真正的黑结。当我服刑并为 Kellett's 邮购热线工作时学到的。经验丰富的手。每个结都说明了很多。让我。出于礼貌。今天之前我跪过一次。啊!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)
（贝拉微微举起长袍，稳定姿势，将一只肥硕的蹄子和一只穿着丝袜的丰满的蹄子举到椅子边缘。布卢姆，双腿僵硬，上了年纪，弯下她的蹄子，用温柔的手指将鞋带拉出来，系在鞋带上。 .)

BLOOM: (Murmurs lovingly) To be a shoefitter in Manfield’s was my love’s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.
布卢姆：（充满爱意地低语）在曼菲尔德店当一名鞋匠是我爱人年轻时的梦想，是甜蜜扣扣的甜蜜乐趣，是把克莱德路女士的精致小童鞋交叉系到及膝的缎面鞋带，小得令人难以置信。甚至我每天都会拜访他们的蜡像模特雷蒙德，欣赏她在巴黎穿的蜘蛛网软管和大黄脚趾棒。

THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
蹄子：闻闻我热山羊皮的味道。感受一下我的皇家体重。

BLOOM: (Crosslacing) Too tight?
布卢姆：（交叉）太紧了？

THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I’ll kick your football for you.
蹄子：如果你搞砸了，Handy Andy，我会替你踢你的足球。

BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her … person you mentioned. That night she met … Now!
布卢姆：不要像集市舞会之夜那样系错鞋带。厄运。钩住她的……你提到的那个人的错误部位。那天晚上她遇见了……现在！

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)
（他打结花边。贝拉把脚踩在地板上。布卢姆抬起头。她那张沉重的脸，她的眼睛注视着他的眉心。他的眼睛变得暗淡、变黑、眼袋，鼻子变粗。）

BLOOM: (Mumbles) Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen, …
布卢姆：（咕哝着）先生们，我们仍在等待您的进一步命令……

BELLO: (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice) Hound of dishonour!
贝洛：（用蛇怪般的眼神，用男中音）耻辱的猎犬！

BLOOM: (Infatuated) Empress!
布鲁姆：（痴迷地）皇后！

BELLO: (His heavy cheekchops sagging) Adorer of the adulterous rump!
贝洛：（厚重的腮帮子下垂）淫荡臀部的崇拜者！

BLOOM: (Plaintively) Hugeness!
布卢姆：（哀怨地）巨大！

BELLO: Dungdevourer!
贝洛：食粪者！

BLOOM: (With sinews semiflexed) Magmagnificence!
布卢姆：（筋腱半屈）太棒了！

BELLO: Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!
贝洛：下来！ （他用扇子拍拍她的肩膀）向前倾斜脚！左脚向后退一步！你会跌倒的。你正在坠落。双手放下！

BLOOM: (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps) Truffles!
布卢姆：（她的眼睛向上翘，露出钦佩的表情，闭上眼睛，狂吠）松露！

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)
（伴随着一阵刺耳的癫痫般的叫声，她四肢着地，咕哝着，吸着鼻子，在他的脚下扎根：然后躺着，假装死了，紧闭着眼睛，眼睑颤抖着，以最优秀的主人的姿态鞠躬在地上。）

BELLO: (With bobbed hair, purple gills, fit moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in) Footstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot’s glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.
贝洛：（短发，紫色腮，剃光的嘴上留着整齐的小胡子，穿着登山鞋，穿着绿色银纽扣外套，运动裙，戴着带有莫考克羽毛的高山帽，双手深深插在马裤口袋里，脚后跟放在她脖子上并将其磨入）脚凳！感受我的整个重量。奴隶，在你的暴君光荣的高跟鞋的宝座前鞠躬，在骄傲的直立中闪闪发光。

BLOOM: (Enthralled, bleats) I promise never to disobey.
布卢姆：（着迷，咩咩叫）我保证永远不会违背。

BELLO: (Laughs loudly) Holy smoke! You little know what’s in store for you. I’m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I’ll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.
贝洛：（大声笑）天哪！你几乎不知道等待着你的是什么。我是鞑靼人，来安顿你们的小群并闯入你们的家！我敢打赌，肯塔基鸡尾酒无处不在，我让你感到羞耻，老儿子。给我面子，我敢。如果你确实因为预期穿着健身服而受到脚后跟训练而颤抖。

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)
（布鲁姆爬到沙发底下，透过边缘往外看。）

ZOE: (Widening her slip to screen her) She’s not here.
佐伊：（拉开衬衣以遮挡她）她不在这里。

BLOOM: (Closing her eyes) She’s not here.
布鲁姆：（闭上眼睛）她不在这里。

FLORRY: (Hiding her with her gown) She didn’t mean it, Mr Bello. She’ll be good, sir.
弗洛里：（用礼服把她藏起来）她不是故意的，贝洛先生。她会很好的，先生。

KITTY: Don’t be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won’t, ma’amsir.
基蒂：别对她太严厉，贝洛先生。当然您不会，先生。

BELLO: (Coaxingly) Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head) There’s a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How’s that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
贝洛：（哄骗地）来吧，小鸭子，亲爱的，我想和你说句话，亲爱的，只是为了纠正错误。只是一点心与心的交谈，亲爱的。 （布卢姆胆怯地伸出头）现在有一个很好的女孩了。 （贝洛猛烈地抓住她的头发，把她往前拖）我只是想在一个柔软安全的地方纠正你，为了你好。后面的温柔怎么样？噢，如此温柔地抚摸。开始准备。

BLOOM: (Fainting) Don’t tear my …
布鲁姆：（晕倒）别撕破我的……

BELLO: (Savagely) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I’ll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You’re in for it this time! I’ll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson’s fat hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness’s porter. (He belches) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler’s Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you. (He twists her arm. Bloom squeals, turning turtle.)
贝洛：（粗暴地）鼻环、钳子、木棍、吊钩、拳头我会让你亲吻，而笛子则像古代的努比亚奴隶一样吹奏。这次你有机会了！我会让你记住我，以平衡你的自然生活。 （他的前额静脉肿胀，脸充血）每天早上，我会坐在你的无背长马鞍背上，吃完马特森的肥肉粉碎机和一瓶吉尼斯黑啤酒的丰盛早餐。 （他打嗝）一边吸着我的好股票交易所雪茄，一边读《特许食品商公报》。很可能我会在我的马厩里把你宰杀并串起来，然后享受一片从烤盘中取出的脆脆的噼啪声，像乳猪一样涂上米饭和柠檬或醋栗酱，然后烘烤。它会伤害你。 （他扭动她的手臂。布卢姆尖叫着，变成了乌龟。）

BLOOM: Don’t be cruel, nurse! Don’t!
布鲁姆：别残忍，护士！不！

BELLO: (Twisting) Another!
贝洛：（扭身）又一个！

BLOOM: (Screams) O, it’s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!
布卢姆：（尖叫）哦，这本身就是地狱！全身的每一根神经都痛得要命！

BELLO: (Shouts) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That’s the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don’t keep me waiting, damn you! (He slaps her face)
贝洛：（大喊）好，由跳跃将军！这是我这六周听到的最好的消息。来吧，别让我等了，该死的！ （他打她的脸）

BLOOM: (Whimpers) You’re after hitting me. I’ll tell …
布卢姆：（呜咽）你在打我。我会告诉 …

BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.
贝洛：按住他，姑娘们，直到我蹲在他身上。

ZOE: Yes. Walk on him! I will.
佐伊：是的。走在他身上！我会。

FLORRY: I will. Don’t be greedy.
弗洛里：我会的。不要贪心。

KITTY: No, me. Lend him to me.
凯蒂：不，是我。把他借给我吧。

(The brothel cook, mrs keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men’s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)
（妓院厨师基奥夫人出现在门口，她满脸皱纹，白胡子，穿着油腻的围兜，穿着男式灰绿袜子和布洛克鞋，身上涂着面粉，赤裸的红胳膊和手上插着一根沾着生糕点的擀面杖。）

MRS KEOGH: (Ferociously) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)
基奥夫人：（凶狠地）我能帮忙吗？ （他们抓住并带动布鲁姆。）

BELLO: (Squats with a grunt on Bloom’s upturned face, puffing cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg) I see Keating Clay is elected vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness’s preference shares are at sixteen three quaffers. Curse me for a fool that didn’t buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom’s ear) Where’s that Goddamned cursed ashtray?
贝洛：（蹲下，对着布卢姆朝上的脸咕哝着，抽着雪茄，抚摸着一条肥腿）我看到基廷·克莱当选为里士满精神病院的副主席，按吉尼斯纪录计算，优先股为十六三倍。诅咒我是个傻瓜，没有买克雷格和加德纳告诉我的那么多东西。只是我的运气太差了，诅咒它。还有那个该死的局外人，赌注是二十比一。 （他愤怒地在布鲁姆耳边熄灭雪茄）那个该死的被诅咒的烟灰缸在哪里？

BLOOM: (Goaded, buttocksmothered) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
布卢姆：（被刺激，屁股被掐住了）哦！哦！怪物！残酷的一个！

BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman’s knees, calls in a hard voice) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I’ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount’s testicles roughly, shouting) Ho! Off we pop! I’ll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.
贝洛：每十分钟询问一次。求。为它祈祷，因为你以前从未祈祷过。 （他伸出一个有花的拳头和难闻的雪茄）来，吻那个。两个都。吻。 （他跨开一条腿，用骑兵的膝盖压着，用严厉的声音喊）起来！一匹前往班伯里十字路口的木马。我会骑着他去参加日食赌注。 （他侧身，粗暴地捏着坐骑的睾丸，喊道）嗬！我们流行吧！我会以适当的方式护理你。 （他骑着公马，在马鞍上跳跃）女士一步一步，车夫快步快跑，先生驰骋驰骋。

FLORRY: (Pulls at Bello) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.
弗洛里：（拉住贝洛）现在让我来对付他。你受够了。我在你之前问过。

ZOE: (Pulling at florry) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?
佐伊：（拉着花）我。我。你还没跟他说完吗，笨蛋？

BLOOM: (Stifling) Can’t.
布鲁姆：（令人窒息）不能。

BELLO: Well, I’m not. Wait. (He holds in his breath) Curse it. Here. This bung’s about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.
贝洛：嗯，我不是。等待。 （他屏住呼吸）诅咒它。这里。这个塞子快要爆了。 （他打开身后的塞子：然后，扭曲他的脸，大声放屁）接受那个！ （他又自言自语）是的，金戈，十六个四分之三。

BLOOM: (A sweat breaking out over him) Not man. (He sniffs) Woman.
布卢姆：（浑身冒汗）不是人。 （他吸了吸鼻子）女人。

BELLO: (Stands up) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!
贝洛：（站起来）不再忽冷忽热了。你所渴望的已经实现了。从此以后，你就不再有人操纵，而是真正属于我的，成为枷锁之下的东西了。现在轮到你的惩罚服了。你会脱掉你的男装，你明白吗，鲁比·科恩？穿上丝绸，奢华地在头和肩上沙沙作响。而且也很快！

BLOOM: (Shrinks) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tiptouch it with my nails?
布卢姆：（收缩）丝绸，女主人说！哦，皱巴巴的！好斗！我必须用指甲轻轻触碰它吗？

BELLO: (Points to his whores) As they are now so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you …
贝洛：（指着他的妓女）你也会像她们现在一样，戴假发，烧焦，喷香水，涂米粉，腋窝刮得光滑。将在您的皮肤附近进行卷尺测量。你会被残酷的力量束缚在柔软的鸽子外衣的虎钳式紧身胸衣上，鲸鱼骨的躯干一直延伸到镶有钻石的骨盆，绝对的外侧边缘，而你的身材，比自由时更丰满，将被紧身连衣裙、漂亮的两盎司衬裙和流苏所束缚。当然，还有印有我家旗帜的东西，为爱丽丝制作的可爱内衣和为爱丽丝制作的好闻的香水。爱丽丝会感受到拉力。玛莎和玛丽穿着如此精致的大腿套，一开始会有点冷，但裸露膝盖上的褶边蕾丝会提醒你……

BLOOM: (A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large male hands and nose, leering mouth) I tried her things on only twice, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.
布卢姆：（一个迷人的红娘子，脸颊灰白，头发呈芥末色，男性的大手和鼻子，嘴角斜视）我只在霍尔斯街试穿过她的衣服两次，只是一个小恶作剧。当我们穷的时候，我把它们洗了，以节省洗衣费。我把自己的衬衫翻了过来。这是最纯粹的节俭。

BELLO: (Jeers) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat’s udders in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?
贝洛：（嘲笑）让妈妈高兴的小工作，是吗？然后在百叶窗后面的镜子里，在镜子里卖弄风情地展示你的多米诺骨牌，摆出各种投降的姿势，是不是？嗬！嗬！我必须笑！米里亚姆·丹德拉德夫人从谢尔本酒店卖给你的那件二手黑色手术服和短腿顽皮在她上次强奸时都裂开了缝线，是吗？

BLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.
布鲁姆：米丽亚姆。黑色的。半梦半醒。

BELLO: (Guffaws) Christ Almighty it’s too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M. P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again) Christ, wouldn’t it make a Siamese cat laugh?
贝洛：（大笑）万能的上帝啊，这太痒了！当丹德拉德夫人即将被斯迈斯-斯迈斯中尉、菲利普·奥古斯都·布洛克韦尔先生、议员拉奇·达雷莫、强壮的男高音、蓝眼睛的伯特侵犯时，你剪掉了后门的头发，昏昏欲睡地躺在床对面的东西上时，你是一个漂亮的米里亚姆。 ，电梯男孩，戈登·贝内特成名的亨利·弗勒里，谢里登，四人组克洛伊索斯，来自老三一大学的湿球八人，庞托，她辉煌的纽芬兰和鲍勃，曼诺汉密尔顿公爵夫人。 （他再次大笑）上帝啊，这不会让暹罗猫发笑吗？

BLOOM: (Her hands and features working) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister’s stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.
布卢姆：（她的手和五官都在工作）当我在高中戏剧《反之亦然》中扮演女模仿者时，杰拉德让我成为了一个真正的紧身胸衣爱好者。这是亲爱的杰拉德。他有这样的癖好，对姐姐的住宿很着迷。现在，最亲爱的杰拉德用粉红色的油彩给他的眼睑镀上金色。对美丽的崇拜。

BELLO: (With wicked glee) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.
贝洛：（带着邪恶的喜悦）美丽！让我们喘口气吧！当你带着女人般的关怀坐在光滑的王座上，掀起波浪般的荷叶边时。

BLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly) And really it’s better the position … because often I used to wet …
布鲁姆：科学。比较我们各自享受的各种快乐。 （真诚地）这个位置确实更好……因为我经常湿……

BELLO: (Sternly) No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I? Do it standing, sir! I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you’ll find I’m a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
贝洛：（严厉地）不准不服从！木屑就在角落里等着你。我给了你严格的指示，不是吗？站着做，先生！我来教你如何表现得像个混蛋！如果我在你的襁褓上发现了痕迹。啊哈！凭着多兰一家的屁股，你会发现我是个严格的人。你过去的罪孽正在向你袭来。许多。数百个。

THE SINS OF THE PAST: (In a medley of voices) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?
过去的罪恶：（混杂的声音）他在黑人教会的阴影下与至少一个女人经历了一种秘密婚姻。当他在电话亭里的仪表前不雅地展示自己时，他在心里给邓恩小姐打电话，地址是多利尔街的一个地址，里面有一些难以形容的信息。他通过言语和行动坦率地鼓励夜间妓女将粪便和其他物质存放在与空置房屋相连的不卫生的户外厕所中。他在五个公共便利设施中用铅笔写下信息，向所有强健的男性提供他的结婚伴侣。他难道不是通过那些散发着令人厌恶的尖酸刻薄的作品，夜复一夜地在热恋中的情侣中度过，看看他是否能看到、能看到什么、能看到多少？难道他不是躺在床上，这头恶心的野猪，在姜饼和一张邮政汇票的刺激下，幸灾乐祸地看着一个肮脏的妓女送给他的一块用过的卫生纸的恶心碎片吗？

BELLO: (Whistles loudly) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out! Be candid for once.
贝洛：（大声吹口哨）说！在你的犯罪生涯中，最令人反感的淫秽作品是什么？全力以赴。吐出来吧！坦诚一次。

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Booloohoom. Poldy Kock, Bootlaces a penny Cassidy’s hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other, the …)
（沉默的、非人的面孔聚集在前面，斜视着，消失了，胡言乱语，胡言乱语。波迪·科克，给卡西迪的女巫拴上一便士的鞋带，盲目的小伙子，拉里·犀牛，那个女孩，那个女人，那个妓女，另一个，那个……）

BLOOM: Don’t ask me! Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the … I swear on my sacred oath …
布鲁姆：别问我！我们共同的信念。普莱辛斯街。我只想到了一半……我以神圣的誓言发誓……

BELLO: (Peremptorily) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr …
贝洛：（断然地）回答。可恶的坏蛋！我坚持要知道。告诉我一些让我开心的事情，色情内容或者一个该死的好鬼故事或者一行诗，快，快，快！在哪里？如何？什么时候？有多少个？我只给你三秒钟。一！二！ ……

BLOOM: (Docile, gurgles) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant
布卢姆：（温顺，咯咯地笑）我在 rerererepugnant 中 rererepugnosed

BELLO: (Imperiously) O, get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you’re spoken to.
贝洛：（专横地）哦，滚出去，你这个臭鼬！管住你的舌头！当有人对你说话时请说话。

BLOOM: (Bows) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
布卢姆：（鞠躬）师父！情妇！曼塔梅尔！

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fill.)
（他举起双臂。他的手镯充满了手镯。）

BELLO: (Satirically) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won’t that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
贝洛：（讽刺地）白天，当我们女士身体不舒服时，你也会浸泡和拍打我们有气味的内衣，用别针别着衣服，在尾巴上绑一块抹布来擦拭我们的厕所。那不是很好吗？ （他把红宝石戒指戴在她的手指上）现在就在那里！有了这枚戒指，我就拥有了你。说吧，谢谢你，女主人。

BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.
布鲁姆：谢谢你，夫人。

BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I’ll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You’ll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I’ll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points) For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s vulva) There’s fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder’s face) Here wet the deck and wipe it round!
贝洛：你要铺床，准备好浴缸，清空不同房间的小便池，包括老基奥太太的厨师房间，一间沙质房间。嗯，注意，把七个人都冲洗干净，或者像喝香槟一样把它喝掉。喝我热气腾腾的。跳！你会跳舞出席，否则我会教训你的错误行为，鲁比小姐，然后用发刷好好打你光秃秃的机器人屁股，小姐。你会被教导你的做法是错误的。晚上，你戴着手镯、涂满奶油的手会戴上四十三粒纽扣的手套，手套上涂有滑石粉，指尖有淡淡的香味。为了这样的恩惠，古代的骑士献出了生命。 （他轻笑）我的孩子们看到你如此淑女，上校，最重要的是，当他们在婚礼前一天晚上来到这里，穿着镀金高跟鞋抚摸我的新吸引力时，他们一定会非常着迷。首先我会亲自尝试一下。我在草地上认识一个名叫查尔斯·艾伯塔·马什的男人（我刚才和他上床，也是哈纳珀和佩蒂包办公室的另一位绅士）正在寻找一个敲门声很短的女佣。丰胸。微笑。肩膀下垂。有什么优惠？ （他指着）那批。由主人训练如何将篮子放在嘴里取东西和搬运。 （他露出手臂，将手肘深深地插入布鲁姆的阴户）对你来说深度很好！什么，男孩们？那给你一个硬？ （他把手臂伸到投标人的脸上）把甲板弄湿，擦干净！

A BIDDER: A florin.
投标人：一弗罗林。

(Dillon’s lacquey rings his handbell.)
（狄龙的漆器敲响了他的手铃。）

THE LACQUEY: Barang!
拉克：巴朗！

A VOICE: One and eightpence too much.
一个声音：一又八便士太多了。

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
查尔斯·艾伯塔·马什：必须是处女。好呼吸。干净的。

BELLO: (Gives a rap with his gavel) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His sire’s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial C on Bloom’s croup) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
贝洛：（用木槌敲击）两小节。最低的数字和便宜的价格。十四手高。触摸并检查他的观点。对付他。这柔软的皮肤，这些柔软的肌肉，这嫩嫩的肉。如果我这里只有我的金穿孔器就好了！而且很容易挤奶。每天三加仑新水。一个纯粹的库存收集者，将在一个小时内下注。他父亲的牛奶记录是四十周内喝了一千加仑全脂牛奶。哇我的宝石！求求了！哇！ （他在布鲁姆的臀部上烙下了他名字首字母 C 的印记）那么！科恩有保证！先生们，两位鲍勃有什么进展？

A DARKVISAGED MAN: (In disguised accent) Hoondert punt sterlink.
一个黑脸男人：（用伪装的口音）Hoondert punt sterlink。

VOICES: (Subdued) For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.
声音：（低声）为哈里发。哈伦·阿尔·拉希德。

BELLO: (Gaily) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.
贝洛：（高兴地）是的。让他们都来吧。短裙，短到膝盖处，露出一抹白色长裤，是一种有力的武器；透明的长筒袜，翠绿色的吊带，长直的接缝一直延伸到膝盖以上，吸引了厌倦男人的更好本能。关于城镇。学习踩着四英寸 Louis Quinze 高跟鞋平稳、装腔作势的行走，希腊式弯曲，臀部挑衅，大腿光滑，膝盖谦虚地接吻。发挥你所有的魅力来吸引他们。迎合他们的蛾摩拉汉恶习。

BLOOM: (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth) O, I know what you’re hinting at now!
布卢姆：（把涨红的脸埋进腋下，用食指含着嘴傻笑）哦，我知道你现在在暗示什么！

BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds of Bloom’s haunches) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where’s your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It’s as limp as a boy of six’s doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly) Can you do a man’s job?
贝洛：像你这样无能的人，你还有什么用处？ （他弯下腰，凝视着，用扇子粗鲁地戳着布卢姆臀部肥厚的羊脂褶皱）起来！向上！马恩岛猫！我们这里有什么？你的卷曲茶壶去哪儿了，或者谁把它放在你身上了，狂妄自大？唱歌，小鸟，唱歌。它就像一个六岁的男孩在推车后面打台球一样无力。买一个水桶或卖掉你的泵。 （大声）你能做男人的工作吗？

BLOOM: Eccles street …
布鲁姆：埃克尔斯街……

BELLO: (Sarcastically) I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world but there’s a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He’s no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don’t it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt) Spittoon!
贝洛：（讽刺地）我不会伤害你对这个世界的感情，但那里有一个肌肉发达的人。形势逆转了，我的同性恋年轻人！他有点像一个成熟的户外男人。对你来说，你这家伙，如果你有一把布满旋钮、肿块和疣的武器的话。他开枪了，我可以告诉你！脚对脚，膝盖对膝盖，肚皮对肚皮，宝宝对乳房！他不是太监。他身后有一头红发，像毛毛虫一样伸出来！等九个月吧，小伙子！天哪，它已经在她的肚子里踢来踢去、咳嗽不止了！这让你很疯狂，不是吗？触及到那个地方了吗？ （他轻蔑地吐口水）痰盂！

BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I … Inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I …
布鲁姆：我受到了非礼，我……通知了警察。一百磅。难以言表。我 …

BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your drizzle.
贝洛：如果可以的话，你愿意吗，跛脚鸭。我们要的是倾盆大雨，而不是你的毛毛雨。

BLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll … We … Still …
布鲁姆：让我发疯！摩尔！我忘了！原谅！莫尔……我们……仍然……

BELLO: (Ruthlessly) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman’s will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.
贝洛：（无情地）不，利奥波德·布鲁姆，自从你二十年来在《断头谷》里横着睡之后，一切都被女人的意志改变了。回来看看。

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)
（老断头谷在大地中呼唤。）

SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Rip van Winkle!
断头谷：瑞普·范·温克！瑞普·范·温克尔！

BLOOM: (In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out) I see her! It’s she! The first night at Mat Dillon’s! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he …
布卢姆：（穿着破烂的莫卡辛鞋和生锈的猎枪，踮起脚尖，指尖尖尖，他那张憔悴、瘦骨嶙峋的胡须脸透过钻石窗向外张望，大声喊道）我看到她了！是她！在马特·狄龙家的第一个晚上！但是那件衣服，绿色的！她的头发染成了金色，而他……

BELLO: (Laughs mockingly) That’s your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.
贝洛：（嘲笑地笑）那是你的女儿，你这个猫头鹰，和一个穆林加的学生在一起。

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)
（米莉·布鲁姆，金发，绿背心，穿着修身鞋，她的蓝色围巾在海风中飘扬，从爱人的怀里挣脱出来，呼唤着，她年轻的眼睛睁得大大的。）

MILLY: My! It’s Papli! But, O Papli, how old you’ve grown!
米莉：天啊！是帕普利！但是，帕普利啊，你已经多大了！

BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote, aunt Hegarty’s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his menfriends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos’ Rest! Why not? How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander O.
贝洛：改变了，嗯？我们的什么东西，我们从未写过字的写字台，赫加蒂阿姨的扶手椅，我们古代大师的经典重印本。一个男人和他的男人朋友住在三叶草里。杜鹃休息！为什么不？有多少女人让你，呃，在黑暗的街道上平足地跟着她们，用你压抑的咕哝来刺激她们，什么，你这个男妓？无可指责的女士们带着一包包的杂货。转身。鹅酱，我的公鹅O。

BLOOM: They … I …
布鲁姆：他们……我……

BELLO: (Cuttingly) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren’s auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art’ sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom’s.
贝洛：（刻薄地）他们的鞋跟印将印在你在雷恩拍卖会上买的布鲁塞尔地毯上。他们与顽皮的莫尔打闹，寻找她裤子里的雄鹿跳蚤，他们会毁坏你在雨中带回家的小雕像，为了艺术而艺术。他们会侵犯你最底层抽屉的秘密。将从你的天文学手册中撕下几页，将其制成烟斗。他们会在你汉普顿利登店的十先令黄铜挡泥板里吐口水。

BLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove …
布鲁姆：十和六。低级恶棍的行为。让我走。我会回来。我会证明……

A VOICE: Swear!
一个声音：发誓！

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his teeth.)
（布卢姆握紧拳头，匍匐前进，牙齿间叼着一把弓刀。）

BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don’t you forget it, old bean.
贝洛：作为付费客人还是受雇者？为时已晚。你已经铺好了第二好的床，其他人必须躺在上面。你的墓志铭已经写好了。你落魄了，别忘了，老豆子。

BLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody …? (He bites his thumb)
布鲁姆：正义！全爱尔兰对一！没有人……吗？ （他咬住拇指）

BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that’ll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have! If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We’ll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, whatever the buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh) We’ll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!
贝洛：如果你还有点正派或优雅的感觉，那就去死吧。我可以给你一杯稀有的老酒，让你在地狱里跳来跳去。签署遗嘱并将您拥有的任何硬币留给我们！如果你没有看到，你就可以得到它，偷它，抢它！我们会把你埋在我们的灌木丛里，在那里你会和老卡克·科恩、我结婚的继侄子、那个该死的痛风老检察官和脖子上有鸡奸的人，还有我的另外十个或十一个丈夫，不管怎样，一起死去，肮脏不堪。那些混蛋的名字，都被窒息在一个污水坑里了。 （他爆发出一声充满痰的大笑）我们会给你施肥的，弗劳尔先生！ （他轻蔑地吹着口哨）再见，波尔迪！再见，帕普利！

BLOOM: (Clasps his head) My willpower! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff …
布鲁姆：（抱住头）我的意志力！记忆！我犯罪了！我有够了……

(He weeps tearlessly)
（他流着泪）

BELLO: (Sneers) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!
贝洛：（冷笑）爱哭鬼！鳄鱼的眼泪！

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater, Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, P. Mastiansky, The Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)
（布卢姆，破碎的，严密地蒙着面纱准备献祭，抽泣着，脸对着大地。传来了过往的钟声。受过割礼的黑衣人像，披着麻布，沾着灰，站在哭墙旁边。M.舒洛莫维茨，约瑟夫·戈德华特，摩西赫尔佐格、哈里斯·罗森伯格、M.莫伊泽尔、J.西特伦、米妮·沃特曼、P.马斯蒂安斯基、利奥波德·阿布拉莫维茨牧师、查森。他们挥舞着手臂，对着胆怯的布鲁姆在气势中哭泣。）

THE CIRCUMCISED: (In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.
受割礼的人：（当他们把死海果扔在他身上时，用阴暗的喉音吟唱，没有花）Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad。

VOICES: (Sighing) So he’s gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There’s the widow. That so? Ah, yes.
声音：（叹气）所以他走了。是啊。确实是的。盛开？从来没有听说过他。不？有点奇怪的家伙。那是寡妇。这么？是啊。

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)
（樟脑香的火焰从火堆中升起。熏香的烟雾遮蔽并消散。从她的橡木框架中，一位头发散开的仙女，披着茶褐色的艺术色彩，从她的洞穴中走下来，穿过交错的紫杉树，站在布卢姆上方。 ）

THE YEWS: (Their leaves whispering) Sister. Our sister. Ssh!
紫杉树：（树叶低语）姐妹。我们的妹妹。嘘！

THE NYMPH: (Softly) Mortal! (Kindly) Nay, dost not weepest!
女神：（轻声）凡人！ （和蔼地）不，别哭！

BLOOM: (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.
布卢姆：（在树枝下像果冻一样向前爬行，在阳光的照耀下，尊严地）这个姿势。我觉得这是对我的期望。习惯的力量。

THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
宁芙：凡人！你发现我和邪恶的伙伴在一起，高踢者、野餐者、拳击手、受欢迎的将军、穿着紧身裤的不道德的哑剧男孩和俏皮的摇摆舞者、拉奥罗拉和卡里尼，音乐表演，世纪热门。我被藏在散发着石油气味的廉价粉红色纸里。我周围都是俱乐部成员的陈旧污言秽语、扰乱幼稚青年的故事、透明胶片的广告、真实的骰子和胸垫、专有文章以及为什么要佩戴带有破碎绅士推荐的桁架。对已婚人士有用的提示。

BLOOM: (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap) We have met before. On another star.
布卢姆：（把乌龟头举到膝盖上）我们以前见过。在另一颗星星上。

THE NYMPH: (Sadly) Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann’s wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.
女神：（悲伤地）橡胶制品。 Neverrip品牌供应给贵族。男士紧身胸衣。我治好病或者退钱。未经请求的对瓦尔德曼教授精彩的胸部扩展的推荐。格斯·鲁布林夫人用照片报道说，我的胸部在三周内长了四英寸。

BLOOM: You mean Photo Bits?
布鲁姆：你是说照片位吗？

THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.
女神：我愿意。你把我带走，用橡木和金属丝框住我，把我放在你的结婚沙发上。不知不觉中，一个夏日的夜晚，你吻了我的四个地方。你用爱的铅笔遮住了我的眼睛、我的胸部和我的耻辱。

BLOOM: (Humbly kisses her long hair) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.
布鲁姆：（谦卑地亲吻她的长发）你经典的曲线，美丽的不朽，我很高兴看到你，赞美你，美丽的事物，几乎是祈祷。

THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.
女神：在漆黑的夜晚我听到了你的赞美。

BLOOM: (Quickly) Yes, yes. You mean that I … Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive vent. (He sighs) ‘Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.
布鲁姆：（很快）是的，是的。你的意思是我……睡眠暴露了每个人最糟糕的一面，也许孩子除外。我知道我从床上掉下来或者更确切地说是被推了。据说钢酒可以治疗打鼾。其余的是英国发明，我几天前收到的小册子，地址错误。它声称可以提供无噪音、无害的通风口。 （他叹了口气）“从来都是这样。”脆弱，你的名字是婚姻。

THE NYMPH: (Her fingers in her ears) And words. They are not in my dictionary.
女神：（她的手指放在耳朵里）还有话语。我的字典里没有他们。

BLOOM: You understood them?
布鲁姆：你理解他们吗？

THE YEWS: Ssh!
紫杉们：嘘！

THE NYMPH: (Covers her face with her hands) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
女神：（用手捂住脸）我在那个房间里有什么没看到的？我的眼睛必须看不起什么？

BLOOM: (Apologetically) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.
布鲁姆：（抱歉地）我知道。弄脏的个人亚麻布，小心反面朝上。圈环松了。很久以前从直布罗陀经过漫长的海路。

THE NYMPH: (Bends her head) Worse, worse!
女神：（低下头）更糟，更糟！

BLOOM: (Reflects precautiously) That antiquated commode. It wasn’t her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.
布卢姆：（小心翼翼地思考）那个过时的马桶。这不是她的体重。她只爬了十一石九。断奶后她增加了九磅。这是一条裂缝，而且缺少胶水。呃？还有那个荒唐的橙色钥匙器具，只有一个把手。

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)
（明亮的瀑布中传来瀑布的声音。）

THE WATERFALL:
瀑布：

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
波拉福卡 波拉福卡

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
波拉福卡 波拉福卡。

THE YEWS: (Mingling their boughs) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.
紫杉树：（把树枝交缠在一起）听着。耳语。她是对的，我们的妹妹。我们在 Poulaphouca 瀑布旁长大。我们在慵懒的夏日提供阴凉。

JOHN WYSE NOLAN: (In the background, in Irish National Forester’s uniform, doffs his plumed hat) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!
约翰·怀斯·诺兰：（在背景中，穿着爱尔兰国家森林管理员的制服，摘下他的羽毛帽）繁荣！爱尔兰的树木，在慵懒的日子里遮荫吧！

THE YEWS: (Murmuring) Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?
紫杉们：（低语）谁随着高中旅行来到了普拉普卡？谁离开了他那些疯狂探索的同学来寻找我们的影子？

BLOOM: (Scared) High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession of faculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.
布卢姆：（害怕）波拉高中？姆尼莫？不具备完全的能力。脑震荡。被电车碾过。

THE ECHO: Sham!
回声：假的！

BLOOM: (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with badge) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes, instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice), even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.
布卢姆：（内八字胸，宽肩，衬垫，穿着不起眼的青少年灰色和黑色条纹西装，对他来说太小了，白色网球鞋，带有翻领上衣的镶边长筒袜，戴着带有徽章的红色学生帽）我十几岁，是一个正在成长的男孩。一点点就足够了，一辆颠簸的汽车，女士衣帽间和盥洗室的混合气味，拥挤在旧皇家楼梯上的人群（因为他们喜欢迷恋，群体的本能，以及黑暗的性感气味剧院放纵罪恶），甚至他们的袜子的价目表。然后是热量。那年夏天有太阳黑子。放学了。还有醉酒蛋糕。宁静的日子。

(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)
（宁静的日子里，穿着蓝色和白色足球球衣和短裤的高中男孩，唐纳德·特恩布尔大师、亚伯拉罕·查特顿大师、欧文·戈德堡大师、杰克·梅雷迪思大师、珀西·阿普约翰大师，站在树林中的空地上，向利奥波德·布鲁姆大师喊道。 ）

THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! (They cheer)
宁静的日子：鲭鱼！让我们再活一次。欢呼！ （他们欢呼）

BLOOM: (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent snowballs, struggles to rise) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let’s ring all the bells in Montague street. (He cheers feebly) Hurray for the High School!
布卢姆：（一瘸一拐，戴着温暖的手套，裹着乳房，手里拿着用过的雪球，挣扎着站起来）又来了！我感觉十六岁了！真是个百灵鸟啊！让我们敲响蒙塔古街的所有钟声。 （他有气无力地欢呼）高中万岁！

THE ECHO: Fool!
回声：傻瓜！

THE YEWS: (Rustling) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?
紫杉们：（沙沙声）她是对的，我们的妹妹。耳语。 （整个树林里都传来低声的亲吻声。狒狒的脸从树干和树叶间探出头来，绽放开来。） 谁亵渎了我们沉默的树荫？

THE NYMPH: (Coyly, through parting fingers) There? In the open air?
女神：（腼腆地，通过分开的手指）在那里？在露天？

THE YEWS: (Sweeping downward) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
紫杉们：（向下扫视）姐妹，是的。在我们的处女地。

THE WATERFALL:
瀑布：

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
波拉福卡 波拉福卡

Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.
福卡福卡 福卡福卡。

THE NYMPH: (With wide fingers) O, infamy!
女神：（张开手指）啊，可恶！

BLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains with poor papa’s operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I … A saint couldn’t resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?
布鲁姆：我很早熟。青年。动物群。我向森林之神献祭了。那些在春天绽放的花朵。这是配对时间。毛细管吸引力是一种自然现象。洛蒂·克拉克，亚麻色头发，我透过未拉紧的窗帘和可怜的爸爸的望远镜看到她晚上上厕所时：这个放荡的人疯狂地吃草。她从里亚托桥滚下山坡，用她那流动的动物精神来诱惑我。她爬上了他们那棵弯曲的树，而我……圣人无法抗拒。恶魔附身于我。再说了，谁看见了？

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)
（摇摇晃晃的鲍勃，一头白花小牛，把潮湿鼻孔的头伸进树叶，陷入沉思。）

STAGGERING BOB: (LARGE TEARDROPS ROLLING FROM HIS PROMINENT EYES, SNIVELS) Me. Me see.
令人震惊的鲍勃：（大颗大颗的泪珠从他那双突出的眼睛里滚落下来，流着鼻涕）我。我明白了。

BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I … (With pathos) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn’t play …
布卢姆：只是为了满足我的需要……（带着悲伤）当我去当女孩时，没有女孩会这么做。太丑了。他们不会玩……

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)
（一只保姆山羊在本·霍斯高处穿过杜鹃花丛，胖乎乎的，屁股翘着，掉落着葡萄干。）

THE NANNYGOAT: (Bleats) Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!
山羊保姆：（咩咩地叫）Megegaggeggg！楠楠楠！

BLOOM: (Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and gorsespine) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer’s clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion’s Head cliff into the purple waiting waters.)
布卢姆：（没戴帽子，脸色通红，身上长满蓟毛和金雀花刺）经常参与其中。情况会改变情况。 （他专注地向下凝视水面）每秒三十二次。新闻界的噩梦。头晕的伊利亚。从悬崖上掉下来。政府印刷厂职员的悲惨结局。 （在银色寂静的夏日空气中，布鲁姆的假人，在木乃伊中滚动，从狮头悬崖旋转地滚入紫色的等待水域。）

THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!
假人妈妈：Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg！

(Far out in the bay between bailey and kish lights the Erin’s King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)
（在贝利和基什灯光之间的海湾深处，艾琳之王号航行，从她的烟囱向陆地喷出越来越大的煤烟。）

COUNCILLOR NANNETII: (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be written. I have …
南尼特议员：（独自一人在甲板上，身穿深色羊驼毛衣，面色黄鸢，手插在背心开口处，朗诵道）当我的国家跻身世界各国之列时，那么，直到那时，就让我写下我的墓志铭吧。我有 …

BLOOM: Done. Prff!
布鲁姆：完成了。噗！

THE NYMPH: (Loftily) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you …?
女神：（高傲地）正如你今天看到的，我们神仙没有这样的地方，那里也没有头发。我们冰冷而纯洁。我们吃电灯。 （她弓起身体，将食指放入嘴里，淫荡地弓起身体）对我说话。背后传来。那你怎么能……？

BLOOM: (Pawing the heather abjectly) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long’s syringe, the ladies’ friend.
布卢姆：（可怜巴巴地用爪子抓着石南花）哦，我一直是一头完美的猪。我也做过灌肠。三分之一品脱苦木，加入一汤匙岩盐。打好基础。与汉密尔顿·朗的注射器，女士们的朋友。

THE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee) And the rest!
女神：当着我的面。粉扑。 （她脸红了，跪下）剩下的！

BLOOM: (Dejected) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules …?
布鲁姆：（沮丧）是的。佩卡维！我向那个活生生的祭坛致敬，那里的背面改变了名字。 （突然热情地）为什么那只精致的芳香宝石手，那只统治的手……？

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing)
（人物在树干周围缓慢地蜿蜒蜿蜒，咕咕叫）

THE VOICE OF KITTY: (In the thicket) Show us one of them cushions.
凯蒂的声音：（在灌木丛中）给我们展示其中一个垫子。

THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.
弗洛里的声音：这里。

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)
（一只松鸡笨拙地振翅穿过林下。）

THE VOICE OF LYNCH: (In the thicket) Whew! Piping hot!
林奇的声音：（在灌木丛中）唷！很热！

THE VOICE OF ZOE: (From the thicket) Came from a hot place.
佐伊的声音：（来自灌木丛）来自一个炎热的地方。

THE VOICE OF VIRAG: (A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
维拉格的声音：（一位鸟酋长，身着蓝色条纹和羽毛，身着战装，带着他的阿塞盖，大步穿过山毛榉和橡子上噼啪作响的藤蔓）热！热的！商品坐牛！

BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.
布鲁姆：它压倒了我。她温暖的身材给人留下了温暖的印象。甚至坐在女人坐过的地方，尤其是大腿分叉，仿佛要给予最后的恩惠，尤其是之前举起的白色缎子大衣盘。女人味十足，十足。它让我充满。

THE WATERFALL:
瀑布：

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
菲拉普拉·波拉普卡

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
波拉福卡 波拉福卡。

THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!
紫杉们：嘘！姐姐，说话吧！

THE NYMPH: (Eyeless, in nun’s white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple, softly, with remote eyes) Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o’er the waters dull.
仙女：（没有眼睛，穿着修女的白色修女服，头巾和巨大的翅膀头巾，目光遥远，轻柔地）特兰基拉修道院。阿加莎姐妹。卡梅尔山。诺克和卢尔德的幻影。不再有欲望。 （她低下头，叹了口气）只有空灵。梦幻般的奶油色海鸥在沉闷的水面上荡漾。

(Bloom half rises. His back trouserbutton snaps.)
（布鲁姆半站起身。他后面的裤扣折断了。）

THE BUTTON: Bip!
按钮：噗！

(Two sluts of the coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)
（库姆的两个荡妇雨般地跳舞，披着披肩，平淡地叫喊着。）

THE SLUTS:
荡妇：

O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
哦，利奥波德丢了抽屉的别针

He didn’t know what to do,
他不知道该怎么办，

To keep it up,
为了坚持下去，

To keep it up.
坚持下去。

BLOOM: (Coldly) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing like an ass pissing.
布卢姆：（冷冷地）你打破了咒语。最后一根稻草。如果只有空灵，你们，准信徒和新手，会在哪里？害羞但愿意像个屁股撒尿。

THE YEWS: (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms aging and swaying) Deciduously!
紫杉树：（银叶飘落，瘦骨嶙峋的手臂衰老摇曳）落叶的！

THE NYMPH: (Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit) Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches again in her robe) Wait. Satan, you’ll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins) Nekum!
女神：（她的表情变得冷酷，在她的习惯的褶皱中摸索）亵渎！来尝试我的美德！ （长袍上出现一大块湿渍）玷污我的清白！你不配碰纯洁女人的衣服。 （她再次抓紧长袍）等等。撒旦，你不会再唱情歌了。阿门。阿门。阿门。阿门。 （她拔出一把匕首，穿着九人选出的骑士的鞘甲，攻击他的腰）Nekum！

BLOOM: (Starts up, seizes her hand) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o’ nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?
布卢姆：（站起来，抓住她的手）嘿！内布拉卡达！猫九命！公平竞争，女士。没有修枝刀。狐狸和葡萄，是吗？你的铁丝网还缺少什么？十字架不够厚？ （他抓着她的面纱）你想要一个神圣的修道院院长，或者布罗菲，跛脚的园丁，或者没有喷嘴的运水人雕像，或者好母亲阿方索斯，是雷纳德吗？

THE NYMPH: (With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks) Poli …!
女神：（他的面纱被揭开，她的石膏绷带裂开，一团恶臭从裂缝中逸出）波利……！

BLOOM: (Calls after her) As if you didn’t get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What’s our studfee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen) Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs) Rut. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.
布卢姆：（在她身后喊道）就好像你自己没有得到它一样。全身没有抽搐和多处粘膜。我尝试过这个。你的强项是我们的弱点。我们的学费是多少？你会在钉子上付出什么代价？我读到，你在里维埃拉支付乞丐的费用。 （逃跑的仙女兴奋地）嗯？我身后有十六年的黑人奴隶劳动。陪审团明天会给我五先令的赡养费吗？骗别人，骗不了我。 （他吸了吸鼻子） 车辙。洋葱。陈旧。硫。润滑脂。

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)
（贝拉·科恩的身影站在他面前。）

BELLA: You’ll know me the next time.
贝拉：下次你就会认识我了。

BLOOM: (Composed, regards her) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Long in the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that’s all. I’m not a triple screw propeller.
布卢姆：（平静地看着她）过去了。羊肉打扮成羔羊。牙齿长，头发多余。晚上最后一件事吃生洋葱会对你的肤色有益。并进行一些双下巴钻。你的眼睛就像你的毛绒狐狸的玻璃眼睛一样无趣。它们具有你其他特征的尺寸，仅此而已。我不是三螺旋桨。

BELLA: (Contemptuously) You’re not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks) Fbhracht!
贝拉：（轻蔑地）事实上，你不玩游戏。 （她的母狗吠叫）Fbhracht！

BLOOM: (Contemptuously) Clean your nailless middle finger first, your bully’s cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.
布卢姆：（轻蔑地）先把你没指甲的中指清理干净，你的恶霸冷酷的精液正从你的鸡冠上滴下来。抓一把干草擦干净自己。

BELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
贝拉：我认识你，游说者！死鳕鱼！

BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
布鲁姆：我看到他了，基普守卫！痘和欢乐小贩！

BELLA: (Turns to the piano) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?
贝拉：（转向钢琴）你们谁在演奏《索尔》的死亡进行曲？

ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms) The cat’s ramble through the slag. (She glances back) Eh? Who’s making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table) What’s yours is mine and what’s mine is my own.
佐伊：我。当心你的矢车菊。 （她冲向钢琴，双臂交叉在钢琴上弹奏和弦）猫在矿渣中漫步。 （她回头看了一眼）嗯？谁在和我的甜心做爱？ （她冲回桌子）你的就是我的，我的就是我自己的。

(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)
（基蒂感到不安，用银纸涂在牙齿上。布卢姆走近佐伊。）

BLOOM: (Gently) Give me back that potato, will you?
布卢姆：（温柔地）把那个土豆还给我，好吗？

ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
佐伊：没收，这是一件很好的事情，而且是一件非常好的事情。

BLOOM: (With feeling) It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.
布卢姆：（满怀感情地）虽然没什么，但仍然是可怜妈妈的遗物。

ZOE:
佐伊：

Give a thing and take it back
给予东西并收回

God’ll ask you where is that
上帝会问你那是哪里

You’ll say you don’t know
你会说你不知道

God’ll send you down below.
上帝会派你到下面去。

BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
布鲁姆：它附有一段记忆。我应该想要拥有它。

STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.
斯蒂芬：有还是没有，这是一个问题。

ZOE: Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh, and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking) Those that hides knows where to find.
佐伊：这里。 （她拉起衬裙，露出裸露的大腿，然后从袜子顶部展开土豆）那些藏起来的人知道去哪里找到。

BELLA: (Frowns) Here. This isn’t a musical peepshow. And don’t you smash that piano. Who’s paying here?
贝拉：（皱眉）这里。这不是一场音乐西洋镜。别把那架钢琴砸坏了。谁在这里付钱？

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)
（她走向钢琴。斯蒂芬在口袋里摸索着，从一角拿出一张钞票，递给她。）

STEPHEN: (With exaggerated politeness) This silken purse I made out of the sow’s ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel ou tenons nostre état.
斯蒂芬：（带着夸张的礼貌）这个丝绸钱包是我用公众的母猪耳朵制作的。女士，请原谅。如果你允许的话。 （他含糊地指着林奇和布鲁姆）我们都在同一个赌注中，金奇和林奇。 Dans ce bordel ou tenons nostre état。

LYNCH: (Calls from the hearth) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.
林奇：（炉边传来呼唤声）德达勒斯！请转达你对我的祝福。

STEPHEN: (Hands Bella a coin) Gold. She has it.
斯蒂芬：（递给贝拉一枚硬币）金币。她有。

BELLA: (Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty) Do you want three girls? It’s ten shillings here.
贝拉：（看看钱，然后看看史蒂芬，然后看看佐伊、弗洛里和基蒂）你想要三个女孩吗？这里是十先令。

STEPHEN: (Delightedly) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.
斯蒂芬：（高兴地）十万次道歉。 （他再次摸索，拿出两顶王冠递给她）允许，brevi manu，我的视力有点问题。

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bends over the table. Kitty leans over Zoe’s neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty’s waist, adds his head to the group.)
（贝拉走到桌边数钱，史蒂芬则用单音节自言自语。佐伊俯身在桌子上。基蒂靠在佐伊的脖子上。林奇站起来，扶正帽子，搂住基蒂的腰，将自己的头加入到队伍中。 ）

FLORRY: (Strives heavily to rise) Ow! My foot’s asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)
弗洛里：（用力站起来）噢！我的脚睡着了。 （她一瘸一拐地走到桌子旁。布卢姆走近。）

BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: (Chattering and squabbling) The gentleman … ten shillings … paying for the three … allow me a moment … this gentleman pays separate … who’s touching it? … ow! … mind who you’re pinching … are you staying the night or a short time? … who did? … you’re a liar, excuse me … the gentleman paid down like a gentleman … drink … it’s long after eleven.
贝拉、佐伊、基蒂、林奇、布卢姆：（喋喋不休地争吵）那位先生……十先令……付三个钱……让我等一下……这位先生单独付钱……谁在碰它？ ……噢！ ……注意你捏的是谁……你是要过夜还是短时间？ … 谁干的？ ……你是个骗子，对不起……绅士像绅士一样还清了……喝酒……已经十一点多了。

STEPHEN: (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle!
斯蒂芬：（在钢琴前，做出厌恶的手势）没有瓶子！什么，十一点？一个谜语！

ZOE: (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking) Hard earned on the flat of my back.
佐伊：（掀起她的衬裙，把半个金镑折进她的长袜里）我的背上辛苦赚来的钱。

LYNCH: (Lifting Kitty from the table) Come!
林奇：（把基蒂从桌子上抱起来）来吧！

KITTY: Wait. (She clutches the two crowns)
凯蒂：等等。 （她抓着两个王冠）

FLORRY: And me?
弗洛里：那我呢？

LYNCH: Hoopla! (He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)
林奇：呼啦！ （他把她举起来，抱起她，然后把她撞到沙发上。）

STEPHEN:
斯蒂芬：

The fox crew, the cocks flew,
狐狸成群，雄鸡飞翔，

The bells in heaven
天上的钟声

Were striking eleven.
十一人引人注目。

‘Tis time for her poor soul
现在是她可怜的灵魂的时候了

BLOOM: (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between bella and florry) So. Allow me. (He takes up the poundnote) Three times ten. We’re square.
布卢姆：（安静地将半金镑放在贝拉和弗洛里之间的桌子上）所以。请允许我。 （他拿起英镑）三乘十。我们是方的。

BELLA: (Admiringly) You’re such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.
贝拉：（钦佩地）你真是个狡猾的家伙，老骄傲。我可以吻你。

ZOE: (Points) Him? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)
佐伊：（指着）他？深如绞井。 （林奇把基蒂弯到沙发上并亲吻她。布卢姆把英镑音符告诉了斯蒂芬。）

BLOOM: This is yours.
布鲁姆：这是你的。

STEPHEN: How is that? Les distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object fills.) That fell.
史蒂芬：怎么样？ Les distrait 或心不在焉的乞丐。 （他又在口袋里摸索，掏出一把硬币。里面装满了一个东西。） 那东西掉了下来。

BLOOM: (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches) This.
布卢姆：（弯下腰，拿起一盒火柴递给他）这个。

STEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.
斯蒂芬：路西法。谢谢。

BLOOM: (Quietly) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?
布卢姆：（轻声地）你最好把这笔钱交给我保管。为什么要付更多钱？

STEPHEN: (Hands him all his coins) Be just before you are generous.
史蒂芬：（把他所有的硬币递给他）在你慷慨之前先要公正。

BLOOM: I will but is it wise? (He counts) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don’t answer for what you may have lost.
布鲁姆：我会的，但这明智吗？ （他数）一、七、十一、五。六。十一。我不会回答你可能失去的东西。

STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.
史蒂芬：为什么要罢工十一点？丙帕羟通。下一刻莱辛说道。口渴的狐狸。 （他大声笑）埋葬他的祖母。很可能是他杀了她。

BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
布鲁姆：那是一磅六又十一磅。比如说，一磅七。

STEPHEN: Doesn’t matter a rambling damn.
斯蒂芬：胡言乱语也没关系。

BLOOM: No, but …
布鲁姆：不，但是……

STEPHEN: (Comes to the table) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy)
史蒂芬：（走到桌边）请给我香烟。 （林奇把一根香烟从沙发上扔到桌子上）所以乔治娜·约翰逊已经死了并且结婚了。 （一支香烟出现在桌子上。斯蒂芬看着它）奇怪。客厅魔术。已婚。嗯。 （他划着一根火柴，带着神秘的忧郁点燃了香烟）

LYNCH: (Watching him) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.
林奇：（看着他）如果你把火柴拉得更近一些，你就会有更好的机会点燃它。

STEPHEN: (Brings the match near his eye) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has twobacks at midnight. Married.
斯蒂芬：（把火柴放在眼睛附近）山猫眼。一定要配眼镜。昨天把它们弄坏了。十六年前。距离。眼睛看到的都是平的。 （他把火柴拉开。火熄灭了。）布莱恩思考着。近：远。可见的不可避免的形态。 （他神秘地皱起眉头）嗯。狮身人面像。半夜有双背的野兽。已婚。

ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.
佐伊：是一位商业旅行者娶了她，并把她带走了。

FLORRY: (Nods) Mr Lambe from London.
弗洛里：（点头）来自伦敦的兰贝先生。

STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
史蒂芬：伦敦的羔羊，带走了我们世界的罪孽。

LYNCH: (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply) Dona nobis pacem.
林奇：（在沙发上拥抱凯蒂，深深地吟诵）Dona nobispacem。

(The cigarette slips from Stephen ‘s fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it in the grate.)
（香烟从斯蒂芬的手指上滑落。布卢姆捡起它并把它扔进壁炉里。）

BLOOM: Don’t smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe) You have nothing?
布鲁姆：不抽烟。你应该吃饭。我遇到的被诅咒的狗。 （对佐伊）你什么都没有吗？

ZOE: Is he hungry?
佐伊：他饿了吗？

STEPHEN: (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods)

Macht uns alle kaputt.
Macht uns alle kaputt。

ZOE: (Tragically) Hamlet, I am thy father’s gimlet! (She takes his hand) Blue eyes beauty I’ll read your hand. (She points to his forehead) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts) Two, three, Mars, that’s courage. (Stephen shakes his head) No kid.
佐伊：（悲惨地）哈姆雷特，我是你父亲的钻头！ （她握住他的手）蓝眼睛的美女我会读你的手。 （她指着他的额头）没有智慧，没有皱纹。 （她数数）二，三，火星，这就是勇气。 （斯蒂芬摇头）不是孩子。

STEPHEN: (Murmurs) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE: What day were you born?

STEPHEN: Thursday. Today.

（她从刚产下的蛋旁侧身走开）

BLOOM: (Points to his hand) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.
布鲁姆：（指着他的手）那是一场意外。二十二年前跌倒并砍断了它。我当时十六岁。

ZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

(Zoe whispers to Florry. they giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)
（佐伊对弗洛里耳语。他们咯咯地笑。布卢姆松开手，反手在桌子上写字，用铅笔画出缓慢的曲线。）

FLORRY: What?
弗洛里：什么？

(A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)
（一辆三百二十四号出租马车，由詹姆斯·巴顿驾驶，在唐尼布鲁克和谐大道上小跑而过。布莱兹·博伊兰和莱内汉四肢摊开，在侧座上摇晃。奥蒙德靴子蹲在车轴后面。可悲的是，在莉迪亚·杜斯和米娜·肯尼迪交叉盲人凝视。）

THE BOOTS: (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers) Haw haw have you the horn?

(They whisper again)
（他们再次窃窃私语）

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan in yachtsman’s cap and white shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan’s coat shoulder.)
（布莱泽斯·博伊兰靠在车的井道上，他的草帽斜放在一边，嘴里叼着一朵红花。莱内汉戴着游艇驾驶帽，穿着白鞋，熟练地从布莱泽斯·博伊兰的外套肩上解下一根长发。）

LENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

博伊兰：（坚定地从车上跳下来，大声叫喊，让所有人都能听到）你好，布鲁姆！布卢姆夫人穿好衣服了吗？

BLOOM: (In flunkey’s prune plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig) I’m afraid not, sir. The last articles …
布卢姆：（穿着仆人的梅红色毛绒外套和及膝马裤，浅黄色长筒袜，戴着扑粉的假发）恐怕不是，先生。最后的文章...

博伊兰：（扔给他六便士）给你，给自己买一杯杜松子酒喝一杯。 （他巧妙地将帽子挂在布鲁姆长角的头上）带我进去。我和你妻子有一点私事，明白吗？

博伊兰：（眼中闪烁着快乐的光芒）顶！

BELLA: What? What is it?
贝拉：什么？它是什么？

(Zoe whispers to her.)
（佐伊对她耳语。）

MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I’ll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.
玛丽昂：让他看看，鱼人！拉皮条！还祸害自己！我会写信给一位有权有势的妓女，或者叫巴塞罗莫娜，那个留着胡须的女人，让他在他身上抽出一英寸厚的鞭子，让他给我带回一张签名盖章的收据。

BOYLAN: (clasps himself) Here, I can’t hold this little lot much longer. (he strides off on stiff cavalry legs)
博伊兰：（抱紧自己）在这里，我不能再忍受这一点了。 （他迈着僵硬的骑兵腿大步走开）

BOYLAN: (To Bloom, over his shoulder) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
博伊兰：（越过肩膀对布鲁姆说）你可以把眼睛盯着钥匙孔，自己玩，而我只是穿过她几次。

BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds out an ointment jar) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower …? Lukewarm water …?
布鲁姆：谢谢您，先生。我会的，先生。我可以带两个好朋友来见证这一事件并拍张快照吗？ （他拿出一个药膏罐）凡士林，先生？橙花……？温水……？

KITTY: (From the sofa) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.
基蒂：（从沙发上）告诉我们，弗洛里。告诉我们。什么。

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)
（弗洛里对她耳语。低语着情话，大声拍着嘴唇，罂粟花扑通扑通。）

米娜·肯尼迪：（她的眼睛向上）哦，一定是天竺葵和可爱的桃子的香味！哦，他简直崇拜她的每一点！粘在一起了！满身都是吻！

LYNCH: (Points) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs) Hu hu hu hu hu!
林奇：（指着）镜子照向自然。 （笑）呼呼呼呼呼！

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)
（史蒂芬和布鲁姆凝视着镜子。威廉·莎士比亚的脸出现在镜子里，没有胡须，面瘫僵硬，大厅里驯鹿鹿角帽子的倒影映在了他的脸上。）

SHAKESPEARE: (In dignified ventriloquy) ‘Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon’s laugh) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!
莎士比亚：（用庄严的口技）“大声的笑声表明了空虚的心灵。” （对布鲁姆）你以为你是如何隐形的。凝视。 （他用黑阉鸡的笑声叫起来）伊阿古！我的老伙计如何在星期四早上起床。亚戈戈戈！

BLOOM: (Smiles yellowly at the three whores) When will I hear the joke?
布卢姆：（对三个妓女黄笑）我什么时候才能听到这个笑话？

ZOE: Before you’re twice married and once a widower.
佐伊：在你结婚两次、鳏夫一次之前。

BLOOM: Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon when measurements were taken next the skin after his death …
布鲁姆：失误是可以原谅的。即使是伟大的拿破仑，在他死后也进行了贴身测量……

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunney’s tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband’s everyday trousers and turnedup boots, large eights. She holds a Scottish widows’ insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under which her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cod’s mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)
（迪格纳姆太太，寡妇，她的鼻子和脸颊因死亡之语、泪水和汤尼的黄褐色雪利酒而涨得通红，她在杂草丛中匆匆走过，她的帽子歪了，在脸颊、嘴唇和鼻子上涂胭脂和扑粉，一支钢笔在逗弄她的小天鹅。她的裙子出现了她已故丈夫的日常裤子和翻起的靴子，大八号。她拿着一份苏格兰寡妇的保险单和一把大帐篷伞，她的孩子们在伞下和她一起奔跑，帕西用一只鞋跳着，他的领子松了，一束猪肉牛排晃来晃去，弗雷迪在呜咽，苏西的嘴像鳕鱼一样哭泣，爱丽丝与婴儿挣扎。她戴上手铐，她的飘带高高飘扬。）

FREDDY: Ah, ma, you’re dragging me along!
弗雷迪：啊，妈妈，你拖着我走！

SUSY: Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!
SUSY：妈妈，牛肉茶已经嘶嘶作响了！

莎士比亚：（带着麻痹的愤怒）Weda seca whokilla farst。

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeare’s beardless face. The marquee umbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twirling japanesily.)
（马丁·坎宁安留着胡子的脸，再现了莎士比亚没有胡子的脸。大帐篷醉醺醺地摇晃着，孩子们跑到一边。雨伞下出现了坎宁安夫人，戴着风流寡妇帽子，穿着和服。她侧身滑行，鞠躬，日本般地旋转着。）

MRS CUNNINGHAM: (Sings)
坎宁安夫人：（唱）

And they call me the jewel of Asia!
他们称我为亚洲的宝石！

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM: (Gazes on her, impassive) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!
马丁·坎宁安：（凝视着她，面无表情）太棒了！最该死的可怕德米雷普！

STEPHEN: Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgrossfather made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.
斯蒂芬：Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti。皇后区躺着获奖公牛。还记得帕西法伊，我的祖父为了满足他的欲望而制作了第一个忏悔箱。不要忘记格里塞尔·斯蒂文斯夫人，也不要忘记兰伯特家族的后裔。诺亚喝醉了酒。他的方舟是敞开的。

BELLA: None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.
贝拉：这里什么都没有。走错店了。

LYNCH: Let him alone. He’s back from Paris.
林奇：别管他了。他从巴黎回来了。

ZOE: (Runs to stephen and links him) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)
（史蒂芬把帽子戴在头上，跳到壁炉旁，耸耸肩，张开纤细的双手，脸上挂着微笑。）

LYNCH: (Oommelling on the sofa) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrrrrrmmmm.
林奇：（在沙发上咕哝）嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯。

史蒂芬：（做了个鬼脸，头向后仰，大声笑，拍手）笑得很成功。天使多是妓女，圣徒多是该死的恶棍。半蒙戴恩人非常英俊，闪闪发光的钻石，穿着非常和蔼可亲。或者你更喜欢现代人的享乐和老人的堕落？ （他用怪异的手势指着他，林奇和妓女们对此做出了回应）Caoutchouc 雕像女人可翻转或真人大小的处女裸体的 tompeeptom 非常女同性恋的吻五十次。进入，先生，在镜子中看到每个位置都在那里，除了如果欲望表现得非常野兽屠夫的男孩污染了温暖的小牛肝或莎士比亚腹部的煎蛋卷之外，所有的机器。

（西蒙·迪达勒斯的声音嘶哑地回答，有点困倦，但已经准备好了。）

SIMON: That’s all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn’t let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! Haihoop!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox, drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, brighteyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrbling to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, hayforks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, greynegroes waving torches. The crowd bawls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

Skeleton horses, Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminster’s Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rustyarmoured, leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain on a brokenwinded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockeystick at the ready.

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)
（二等兵卡尔、二等兵康普顿和西西·卡弗里从窗下走过，唱着不和谐的歌。）

STEPHEN: Hark! Our friend noise in the street.
史蒂芬：听着！我们的朋友在街上吵闹。

ZOE: (Holds up her hand) Stop!
佐伊：（举起手）停下来！

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON AND CISSY CAFFREY:
卡尔列兵、康普顿列兵和西西·卡弗里：

Yet I’ve a sort a
但我有一个

Yorkshire relish for …
约克郡喜欢……

ZOE: That’s me. (She claps her hands) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola) Who has twopence?
佐伊：那就是我。 （她拍手）跳舞！舞蹈！ （她跑向钢琴）谁有两便士？

BLOOM: Who’ll …?
布鲁姆：谁会……？

LYNCH: (Handing her coins) Here.
林奇：（递给她硬币）这里。

STEPHEN: (Cracking his fingers impatiently) Quick! Quick! Where’s my augur’s rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium)
斯蒂芬：（不耐烦地打响手指）快！快的！我的占卜杖在哪里？ （他跑到钢琴前，拿起他的梣木，用三足敲打脚）

ZOE: (Turns the drumhandle) There.
ZOE：（转动鼓柄）那儿。

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Gold, pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the pianostool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsel’s grace, his bowknot bobbing)
（她在投币口里扔了两枚硬币。金色、粉色和紫色的灯光开始亮起。鼓声以低沉的华尔兹声响起。古德温教授戴着蝴蝶结假发，穿着宫廷礼服，穿着一件染色的因弗内斯斗篷，从令人难以置信的角度弯成两半。年龄，摇摇晃晃地穿过房间，双手颤抖。他小小的坐在钢琴凳上，举起无手的手臂在键盘上敲打，以少女般的优雅地点点头，他的蝴蝶结上下摆动）

ZOE: (Twirls round herself, heeltapping) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who’ll dance? Clear the table.
佐伊：（绕着自己旋转，拍着脚跟）跳舞。有人来这里吗？谁来跳舞？清桌子。

(The pianola with changing lights plays in waltz time the prelude of My Girl’s a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe round the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, arming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her round the room. Bloom stands aside. Her sleeve filling from gracing arms reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Between the curtains Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a gorget of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief, tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is an immense dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand lightly on his breastbone, bows, and fondles his flower and buttons.)
（灯光变换的钢琴以华尔兹的节奏演奏着《我的女孩是约克郡女孩》的前奏。史蒂芬把他的梣木扔到桌子上，搂住佐伊的腰。弗洛里和贝拉把桌子推向壁炉。史蒂芬以夸张的优雅姿势武装佐伊，开始带着她绕着房间跳华尔兹。布卢姆站在一旁。她的袖子从优美的手臂中充满，露出一朵接种过疫苗的白色肉花。马金尼教授在窗帘之间插入一条腿，腿的脚趾上旋转着一顶丝绸帽子。他灵巧地踢了一脚他穿着深紫红色丝绸翻领的石板色礼服外套、奶油色薄纱领口、绿色低胸背心、白色领巾、紧身淡紫色长裤、漆皮高跟鞋和金丝雀手套。是一朵巨大的大丽花。他反向旋转一根云状手杖，然后将其紧紧地插在腋下。他将一只手轻轻放在胸骨上，鞠躬，抚摸他的花朵和纽扣。）

MAGINNI: The poetry of motion, art of calisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne’s or Levenston’s. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner step. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee’s feet) Tout le monde en avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!</p>
MAGINNI：运动的诗意，健美操的艺术。与莱格特·伯恩夫人或莱文斯顿夫人没有任何关系。安排了化装舞会。仪态。凯蒂·兰纳的脚步。所以。看着我！我的terpsichore能力。 （他以蜜蜂般的脚步向前迈出三步）世界在前卫！尊敬！ Tout le monde en place！

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms shrivels, sinks, his live cape filling about the stool. The air in firmer waltz time sounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fide gold rosy violet.)
（前奏结束。古德温教授，拍打着模糊的手臂，萎缩、下沉，他的斗篷填满了凳子。华尔兹节拍中的空气响起。斯蒂芬和佐伊自由地旋转。灯光变化，发出金色的玫瑰紫罗兰色。）

Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls,
两个年轻人正在谈论他们的女孩，女孩，女孩，

Sweethearts they’d left behind …
他们留下的情人……

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slimsandalled, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing, linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)
（早上的时间从角落里跑出来，金头发，穿着修长的凉鞋，少女般的蓝色，腰部细长，双手天真无邪。他们敏捷地跳舞，旋转着跳绳。中午的时间随之而来的是琥珀色的金色。笑声，相连，高高的发梳闪烁，他们举起手臂，在模拟镜子中捕捉阳光。）

MAGINNI: (Clipclaps glovesilent hands) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!
马吉尼：（拍拍手套，沉默的双手）卡雷！前卫双人组！呼吸均匀！平衡！

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing visavis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)
（早上和中午的时间在各自的位置上跳着华尔兹，转身，互相前进，塑造曲线，鞠躬。他们身后的骑士拱起手臂，双手垂落，触摸，从肩膀上抬起。）

THE PIANOLA:
钢琴：

My little shy little lass has a waist.
我那个害羞的小姑娘有腰。

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)
（佐伊和史蒂芬以更宽松的摇摆大胆地转身。暮色从长长的陆地阴影中推进，分散，滞后，慵懒，他们的脸颊因西普里亚和假淡花而精致。他们穿着灰色纱布，深色蝙蝠袖在陆地微风中飘扬。 ）

MAGINNI: Avant huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!
MAGINNI：前卫的风格！特拉维斯！致敬！主菜课程！克鲁瓦塞！

(The night hours, one by one, steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary they curchycurchy under veils.)
（夜晚的时间一一悄悄地溜到了最后一个地方。早晨、中午和黄昏的时间在他们面前退却。他们戴着面具，头发短，戴着沉闷的铃铛手镯。疲倦的他们在面纱下库奇库奇。）

THE BRACELETS: Heigho! Heigho!
手镯：嘿嘿！嘿嘿！

ZOE: (Twirling, her hand to her brow) O!
佐伊：（旋转，手放在额头上）哦！

MAGINNI: Les tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!
马吉尼：Les tiroirs！贵妇链！拉科尔贝耶！多做多做！

(Arabesquing wearily they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twirling, simply swirling.)
（他们疲倦地在地板上编织出阿拉伯式花纹，编织，解开，行屈膝礼，旋转，只是旋转。）

ZOE: I’m giddy!
佐伊：我头晕！

(She frees herself, droops on a chair. Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)
（她挣脱了束缚，倒在椅子上。斯蒂芬抓住弗洛里，和她一起转身。）

MAGINNI: Boulangère! Les ronds! Les ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!
马吉尼：布朗盖尔！莱斯隆兹！莱斯蓬斯！森林之马！田螺！

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands the night hours link each each with arching arms in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)
（缠绕，后退，交替的双手，夜晚的时间用拱形的手臂以马赛克的动作连接在一起。斯蒂芬和弗洛里笨拙地转身。）

MAGINNI: Dansez avec vos dames! Changez de dames! Donnez le petit bouquet à votre dame! Remerciez!
马吉尼：跳舞吧，女士们！女士们变了！ Donnez le petit bouquet à votre dame！再见！

凯蒂：（跳起来）哦，他们在米鲁斯集市的木马上玩过这个！

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bittern’s harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft’s cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)
（她跑向史蒂芬。他粗鲁地离开了弗洛里，抓住了基蒂。一只尖叫的麻鹳发出刺耳的高哨声。咕噜咕噜的托夫特笨重的旋转木马慢慢地绕着房间旋转。）

（她抓住弗洛里，给她跳华尔兹。）

STEPHEN: Pas seul!
史蒂芬：走吧！

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch’s arms, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel whirl waltz twirl. Bloombella Kittylynch Florryzoe jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh. With clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho hornblower blue green yellow flashes Toft’s cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)
（他把基蒂推到林奇的怀里，从桌子上抓起他的梣木，占据地板。全轮旋转华尔兹旋转。布卢姆贝拉·基蒂林奇·弗洛里佐·朱朱比女人。斯蒂芬戴着帽子，白蜡木青蛙劈成中间高踢腿，空中踢腿闭上手扣在大腿下方。伴随着铿锵叮当的轰鸣声，塔里霍霍恩布洛尔蓝绿色黄色闪烁，托夫特笨重地转弯，木马骑手从镀金的蛇上晃来晃去，肠子范丹戈跳跃，抛弃土脚，再次摔倒。）

（情侣们倒在一边。史蒂芬头晕目眩地旋转着。房间旋转着回来。闭上眼睛，他摇摇晃晃。红色铁轨飞向太空。太阳周围的星星在旋转。明亮的蚊子在墙上跳舞。他停了下来。）

STEPHEN: Ho!
史蒂芬：嗬！

(Stephen’s mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor, in leper grey with a wreath of faded orangeblossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with gravemould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)
（史蒂芬的母亲，面容憔悴，从地板上站起来，身着麻风灰衣服，戴着褪色的橙花花环和撕裂的新娘头纱，她的脸磨损了，没有鼻子，带着坟墓的绿色。她的头发稀疏而平直。她固定着她的蓝圈空心眼窝转向史蒂芬，张开没牙的嘴，说出无声的话语。由童女和告解神父组成的唱诗班无声地歌唱。）

THE CHOIR:
合唱团：

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum …
Liliata rutilantium te 忏悔室 …

Iubilantium te virginum …

(from the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester’s dress of puce and yellow and clown’s cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)
（巴克·穆里根站在塔顶，穿着深褐色和黄色的彩色小丑裙，戴着带卷边小丑帽，目瞪口呆地看着她，手里拿着一块冒着烟的黄油分割烤饼。）

BUCK MULLIGAN: She’s beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes) Mercurial Malachi!
巴克·穆里根：她死得很惨。可惜了！马里根见到了饱受折磨的母亲。 （他抬起眼睛）善变的玛拉基！

THE MOTHER: (With the subtle smile of death’s madness) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.
母亲：（带着死亡疯狂的微妙微笑）我曾经是美丽的梅·古尔丁。我死了。

STEPHEN: (Horrorstruck) Lemur, who are you? No. What bogeyman’s trick is this?
史蒂芬：（惊恐）狐猴，你是谁？不对，这是什么鬼把戏？

BUCK MULLIGAN: (Shakes his curling capbell) The mockery of it! Kinch dogsbody killed her bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes on to the scone) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.
巴克·穆里根：（摇晃他的卷发帽）真是讽刺！金奇狗身杀了她的母狗身。她一命呜呼了。 （融化的黄油的泪水从他的眼睛里掉到烤饼上）我们伟大可爱的母亲！ Epi奥伊诺帕浮桥。

THE MOTHER: (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.
母亲：（走近一点，轻轻地向他呼吸湿灰的气息）一切都必须经历这一切，史蒂芬。世界上女性多于男性。你也是。时间将会到来。

STEPHEN: (Choking with fright, remorse and horror) They say I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.
史蒂芬：（因恐惧、悔恨和恐惧而哽咽）他们说我杀了你，妈妈。他侵犯了你的记忆。是癌症干的，不是我干的。命运。

THE MOTHER: (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth) You sang that song to me. Love’s bitter mystery.
母亲：（一道绿色的胆汁从她嘴边流下来）你给我唱了那首歌。爱情的苦涩之谜。

STEPHEN: (Eagerly) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.
史蒂芬：（急切地）妈妈，如果你现在知道的话，请告诉我这个词。这个词是所有人都知道的。

THE MOTHER: Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is allpowerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual and forty days’ indulgence. Repent, Stephen.
母亲：当你和帕迪·李一起在达尔基跳上火车的那个晚上，谁救了你？当你在陌生人中悲伤时，谁会怜悯你？祈祷是万能的。在《乌尔苏拉手册》和四十天的大赦中为受苦的灵魂祈祷。悔改吧，斯蒂芬。

STEPHEN: The ghoul! Hyena!
史蒂芬：食尸鬼！鬣狗！

THE MOTHER: I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brainwork. Years and years I loved you, O, my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.
母亲：我在另一个世界为你祈祷。让迪莉每天晚上在你脑力劳动之后给你煮米饭。哦，我的儿子，我的长子，当你躺在我的子宫里时，我爱了你很多年。

母亲：（双眼冒烟）悔改吧！噢，地狱之火！

STEPHEN: (Panting) His noncorrosive sublimate! The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones.
斯蒂芬：（气喘吁吁）他的无腐蚀性升华物！噬尸者！原始的头和血淋淋的骨头。

THE MOTHER: (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath) Beware! (She raises her blackened withered right arm slowly towards Stephen’s breast with outstretched finger) Beware God’s hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen’s heart.)
母亲：（她的脸越来越近，发出灰白的气息）小心！ （她伸出手指，慢慢地将发黑枯萎的右臂举向史蒂芬的胸前）当心上帝的手！ （一只有着凶恶的红眼睛的绿色螃蟹将它咧着嘴笑的爪子深深地插进了斯蒂芬的心里。）

STEPHEN: (Strangled with rage) Shite! (His features grow drawn grey and old)
史蒂芬：（气得窒息）该死！ （他的面容变得灰白苍老）

BLOOM: (At the window) What?
布鲁姆：（在窗边）什么？

STEPHEN: Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!
史蒂芬：啊不，举个例子！智力的想象力！要么全部和我在一起，要么根本不和我在一起。非奴仆！

FLORRY: Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out)
弗洛里：给他一些冷水。等待。 （她冲出去）

THE MOTHER: (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O Divine Sacred Heart!
母亲：（慢慢地扭动双手，绝望地呻吟）耶稣圣心啊，怜悯他吧！救他脱离地狱，神圣的圣心啊！

STEPHEN: No! No! No! Break my spirit, all of you, if you can! I’ll bring you all to heel!
史蒂芬：不！不！不！如果可以的话，你们所有人都让我精神崩溃！我会让你们都乖乖听话的！

THE MOTHER: (In the agony of her deathrattle) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.
母亲：（在垂死的痛苦中）主啊，为了我，怜悯斯蒂芬吧！当我在各各他山上带着爱、悲伤和痛苦死去时，我的痛苦是无法形容的。

STEPHEN: Nothung!
史蒂芬：没什么！

(He lifts his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time’s livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)
（他双手高举梣木，砸碎了枝形吊灯。时间最后的青色火焰跳跃，在接下来的黑暗中，所有空间都被毁灭，玻璃破碎，砖石倒塌。）

THE GASJET: Pwfungg!

BLOOM: Stop!
布鲁姆：停下来！

LYNCH: (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen’s hand) Here! Hold on! Don’t run amok!

BELLA: Police!
贝拉：警察！

(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flies from the room, past the whores at the door.)
（斯蒂芬丢下他的梣木，头和手臂完全向后仰，拍打着地面，飞出了房间，经过门口的妓女们身边。）

BELLA: (Screams) After him!
贝拉：（尖叫）追他！

(The two whores rush to the halldoor. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)

布卢姆：（抓起斯蒂芬的梣木）我？十先令？你还没有从他身上得到足够的帮助吗？他不是……吗？

BELLA: (Loudly) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn’t a brothel. A ten shilling house.
贝拉：（大声）别再胡言乱语了。这不是妓院。十先令的房子。

BLOOM: (His head under the lamp, pulls the chain. Puling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney’s broken. Here is all he …
布卢姆：（他把头放在灯下，拉动链条。拉动，燃气喷射器点亮了压碎的淡紫色阴影。他举起了梣木。）只有烟囱坏了。这就是他的全部……

BELLA: (Shrinks back and screams) Jesus! Don’t!
贝拉：（向后退缩并尖叫）天啊！不！

BLOOM: (Warding off a blow) To show you how he hit the paper. There’s not sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!

BELLA: Do you want me to call the police?
贝拉：你想让我报警吗？

BLOOM: O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he’s a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don’t want a scandal.
布鲁姆：噢，我知道。斗牛犬在场内。但他是三一学院的学生。您的机构的赞助人。付房租的先生们。 （他做了一个共济会的手势）明白我的意思吗？副校长的侄子。你不想要丑闻。

BELLA: (Angrily) Trinity. Coming down here ragging after the boatraces and paying nothing. Are you my commander here or? Where is he? I’ll charge him! Disgrace him, I will! (She Shouts) Zoe! Zoe!
贝拉：（愤怒地）三位一体。赛艇比赛结束后来到这里，什么也没付。你是我这里的指挥官吗？他在哪里？我要收费他！羞辱他，我要！ （她喊道）佐伊！佐伊！

布鲁姆：什么？在哪里？ （他把一先令扔到桌子上，然后开始）那是给烟囱的。在哪里？我需要山间的空气。

(He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph’s hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follow from fir, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail.

（他急忙穿过大厅。妓女们指指点点。弗洛里跟在后面，她倾斜的水杯里的水洒了出来。门口台阶上所有的妓女都聚集在一起滔滔不绝地交谈，指着右边雾气散去的地方。从左边传来叮当作响的小屋。汽车。它慢到了房子前面。大厅门口的布卢姆看到科尼·凯莱赫正要和两个沉默的色狼一起下车。他转过脸。贝拉在大厅里催促她的妓女。他们吹出令人恶心的美味佳肴亲吻。科尼·凯莱赫以可怕的淫荡微笑回应。沉默的好色者转身付钱给贾维。佐伊和基蒂仍然指着右边。布鲁姆迅速分开他们，拉上哈里发的兜帽和斗篷，侧着脸匆匆走下台阶。因科·哈伦拉希德，他飞快地跟在沉默的色狼后面，沿着栏杆加快前进，像一只豹子一样快步，在他身后散布着拖拉物，撕破的信封浸满了茴香。梣木标志着他的步伐。一群猎犬，由三一的霍恩布洛尔带领，挥舞着一只猎犬。戴着塔利霍帽、穿着一条旧灰色裤子的狗鞭，从冷杉后面跟着，闻到了气味，走近了，吠叫着，气喘吁吁，犯了错，挣脱了，伸出舌头，咬着脚后跟，跳到了他的尾巴上。他走、跑、曲折、驰骋、双腿向后躺着。他被扔满了碎石、卷心菜根、饼干盒、鸡蛋、土豆、死鳕鱼、女人的拖鞋。在他重新发现之后，他的色调和叫声曲折地驰骋，紧追不舍地追随我的领导者：65℃、66℃、夜巡、约翰·亨利·门顿、威斯多姆·赫利、V.B. 狄龙、纳内蒂议员、亚历山大·凯斯、拉里·奥罗克、乔·卡夫·奥多德夫人、皮瑟·伯克、无名者、赖尔丹夫人、公民、加里欧文、Whodoyoucallhim、Strangeface、Fellowthatsolike、Sawhimbefore、查普威萨文、克里斯·卡利南、查尔斯爵士卡梅伦、本杰明·多拉德、莱内汉、巴特尔·达西、乔·海因斯、雷德·默里、编辑布雷登、T.M.希利、菲茨吉本法官、约翰·霍华德·帕内尔、罐头鲑鱼牧师、乔利教授、布林夫人、丹尼斯·布林、西奥多·普尔福、米娜Purefoy，韦斯特兰街邮政局长，C.

色调和哭声：（Helterskelterpelterwelter）他是布鲁姆！停止布鲁姆！停止绽放！阻止强盗！你好！你好！把他拦在角落里！

(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)
（在海狸街的拐角处，脚手架下面，布卢姆气喘吁吁地停在喧闹的争吵结的边缘，很多人根本不知道什么是嗨！嗨！围绕着这场可怕的争吵在一起争吵。）

STEPHEN: (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly) You are my guests. Uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.
斯蒂芬：（用复杂的手势，缓慢地深呼吸）你们是我的客人。不请自来。凭借第五个乔治和第七个爱德华。历史难辞其咎。记忆之母的寓言。

PRIVATE CARR: (To Cissy Caffrey) Was he insulting you?
二等兵卡尔：（对西西·卡弗里）他侮辱你了吗？

STEPHEN: Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
史蒂芬：用女性呼唤语称呼她。应该是中性吧缺乏创造性。

声音：不，他没有。我看见他了。那里的女孩。他在科恩夫人家。这是怎么回事？军人和平民。

CISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do—you know, and the young man run up behind me. But I’m faithful to the man that’s treating me though I’m only a shilling whore.
西西·卡弗里：我和士兵们在一起，他们让我去做——你知道，那个年轻人跑到我身后。但我对对待我的男人忠诚，尽管我只是一个一先令的妓女。

PRIVATE COMPTON: Biff him, Harry.

STEPHEN: (To Private Compton) I don’t know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.
斯蒂芬：（对康普顿二等兵）我不知道你的名字，但你说得很对。斯威夫特博士说，一个穿着盔甲的人可以打败十个穿着衬衫的人。衬衫是提喻。部分为整体。

CISSY CAFFREY: (To The Crowd) No, I was with the privates.
西西·卡弗里：（对人群）不，我和二等兵在一起。

列兵卡尔：（他的帽子歪了，走到史蒂芬面前）喂，州长，如果我打你的下巴，那会怎么样？

STEPHEN: (Looks up to the sky) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin ce sont vos oignons. (To Cissy Caffrey) Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely?
斯蒂芬：（抬头望天）怎么样？非常不愉快。高贵的自我伪装艺术。就我个人而言，我讨厌行动。 （挥手）手有点疼。 Enfin ce sont vos oignons。 （对西西·卡弗里）这里有些麻烦了。到底是什么？

DOLLY GRAY: (From her balcony waves her handkerchief, giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho) Rahab. Cook’s son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.
多莉·格雷：（在阳台上挥动手帕，做出耶利哥女英雄的手势）喇合。库克的儿子，再见。多莉的安全之家。梦见你留下的女孩，她也会梦见你。

STEPHEN: (Turns) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger) I’m not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.
史蒂芬：（转身）嗯？ （他脱离了自己）我为什么不应该对他或任何直立行走在这个扁圆橘子上的人说话呢？ （他指着手指）如果我看到他的眼睛，我就不会害怕可以与之交谈的东西。保持垂直。

(He staggers a pace back)
（他踉踉跄跄地后退一步）

BLOOM: (Propping him) Retain your own.
布鲁姆：（扶住他）保留你自己的。

STEPHEN: (Laughs emptily) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.
斯蒂芬：（空笑）我的重心转移了。我已经忘记了窍门。让我们找个地方坐下来讨论一下。为生存而斗争是生存法则，但人类的慈善主义者，特别是沙皇和英国国王，发明了仲裁。 （他轻拍额头）但在这里我必须杀死牧师和国王。

BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said? He’s a professor out of the college.
BIDDY THE CLAP：你听到教授说什么了吗？他是大学里的教授。

CUNTY KATE: I did. I heard that.
凯特凯特：我做到了。我听说。

BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of phraseology.
BIDDY THE CLAP：他用如此明显精致的措辞来表达自己。

CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.
凯特凯特：确实是的。同时又具有如此恰当的尖锐性。

PRIVATE CARR: (Pulls himself free and comes forward) What’s that you’re saying about my king?
列兵卡尔：（挣脱出来，走上前来）你说我的国王是什么意思？

(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wars a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner’s and Probyn’s horse, Lincoln’s Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterer’s bucket on which is printed Défense d’uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)
（爱德华七世出现在拱门中。他穿着一件白色球衣，上面缝有圣心的图像，上面缝有嘉德和蓟的徽章、金羊毛、丹麦大象、斯金纳和普鲁宾的马、林肯酒馆的长凳和古代和马萨诸塞州光荣的炮兵连。他吮吸着红枣。他穿着一件伟大的选民的长袍，完美而崇高的泥瓦匠，拿着抹子和围裙，标记为德国制造。他的左手拿着一个泥水匠的水桶，上面印着“Défense d'uriner” .欢迎他的欢呼声。）

EDWARD THE SEVENTH: (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly) Peace, perfect peace. For identification, bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a bak.
爱德华七世：（缓慢地、庄严地但含糊不清地）和平，完美的和平。为了便于识别，我手里拿着水桶。欢呼吧，孩子们。 （他转向他的臣民）我们来这里是为了见证一场干净利落的直接战斗，我们衷心祝愿两人好运。玛哈玛卡阿巴克。

(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket graciously in acknowledgment.)

PRIVATE CARR: (To Stephen) Say it again.
卡尔大兵：（对斯蒂芬）再说一遍。

STEPHEN: (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up) I understand your point of view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicines. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country. Suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr’s sleeve) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I didn’t want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!
史蒂芬：（紧张，友好，振作起来）我理解你的观点，尽管我自己目前还没有国王。这是专利药的时代。这里很难进行讨论。但这就是重点。你为你的国家而死。认为。 （他将手臂放在二等兵卡尔的袖子上）并不是说我希望你这么做。但我说：让我的国家为我而死。到目前为止，它已经这样做了。我不想让它死。该死的死亡。生命万岁！

EDWARD THE SEVENTH: (Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face)
爱德华七世：（悬浮在成堆的死者上方，穿着耶稣的服装，带着开玩笑耶稣的光环，磷光脸上有一颗白枣色）

My methods are new and are causing surprise.

To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.
为了让盲人看见，我把灰尘撒到他们的眼睛里。

STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! (He fills back a pace) Come somewhere and we’ll … What was that girl saying? …
史蒂芬：国王和独角兽！ （他后退一步）到某个地方来，我们会……那个女孩在说什么？ ……

PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.
列兵康普顿：呃，哈利，给他一脚。把一根插到杰瑞身上。

BLOOM: (To the privates, softly) He doesn’t know what he’s saying. Taken a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster. I know him. He’s a gentleman, a poet. It’s all right.
布鲁姆：（对二等兵轻声）他不知道自己在说什么。多拿一点对他来说是有好处的。苦艾酒。绿眼怪物。我认识他。他是一位绅士，一位诗人。没关系。

STEPHEN: (Nods, smiling and laughing) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.
斯蒂芬：（点头，微笑着大笑）绅士、爱国者、学者和骗子法官。

PRIVATE CARR: I don’t give a bugger who he is.

唐·埃米尔·帕特里兹·奥·弗朗茨·鲁珀特·教皇轩尼诗：（穿着中世纪的锁子甲，两只大雁在他的头盔上飞翔，带着高贵的愤慨，用一只邮寄的手指向列兵）把那些眼睛放在脚博登，约翰耶洛的大猪身上沾满了肉汁！

布鲁姆：（对斯蒂芬）回家吧。你会遇到麻烦的。

But I love my country beyond the king.

RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER: (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with gladstone bag which he opens) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg.

Phial containing arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent Seddon to the gallows.

（他放弃了鬼魂。绞死者猛烈勃起，大量精液透过他的死衣喷到鹅卵石上。贝灵厄姆夫人、耶尔弗顿·巴里夫人和尊敬的默文·托尔博伊夫人冲上前，用手帕把它擦干。）

RUMBOLD: I’m near it myself. (He undoes the noose) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time. As applied to Her Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!
RUMBOLD：我自己就接近它了。 （他解开绞索）绞死可怕的叛逆者的绳子。一次十先令。适用于殿下。 （他把头伸进绞刑者张开的肚子里，然后又把头伸了出来，里面塞满了盘绕着、冒着烟的内脏）我痛苦的职责现在已经完成了。天佑吾皇！

老软糖奶奶：（来回摇晃）爱尔兰的甜心，西班牙国王的女儿阿兰娜。我家有陌生人，对他们没礼貌！ （她热衷于女妖的悲哀）奥乔涅！奥乔内！牛丝！ （她哭泣）你遇到了可怜的老爱尔兰，她怎么样？

Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackleplume and accoutrements, with epaulettes, gilt chevrons and sabretaches, his breast bright with medals, toes the line.

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marshlands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, cormorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlins, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goatfell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner, in athlete’s singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. Laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragons’ teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O’Brien against Daniel O’Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M’Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond, John O’Leary against Lear O’Johnny, Lord Edward Fitzgerald against Lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O’Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The O’Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the feldaltar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbacans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies, naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O’Flynn in a lace petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. The Reverend Mr Hugh C Haines Love M. A. in a plain cassock and mortarboard, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrant’s head an open umbrella.)

布卢姆：（吹气）幸亏你能赶到现场。你有一辆车？ ……

CORNY KELLEHER: (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet’s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.
科尼·凯勒：（大笑，用拇指越过右肩指向脚手架上的汽车）贾米特餐厅里播放着两则嘶嘶作响的广告。像王子一样，信仰。其中一人在比赛中损失了两英镑。淹没他的悲伤。并与快乐的女孩们一起出去玩。于是我把他们送上了贝汉的车，然后前往夜城。

BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to …
布鲁姆：我正要沿着加德纳街回家，这时我碰巧……

CORNY KELLEHER: (Laughs) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye) Thanks be to God we have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!
CORNY KELLEHER：（笑）当然他们希望我也加入其中。不，上帝作证，我说。不适合像我和你这样的老舞台表演者。 （他又笑了，眼神黯淡）感谢上帝，我们把它放在家里了，什么，呃，你跟着我吗？哈哈哈哈！

BLOOM: (Tries to laugh) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor fellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home …
布鲁姆：（想笑）他，他，他！是的。事实上，我只是去那里拜访我的一位老朋友，维拉格，你不认识他（可怜的家伙，他过去一周都躺着了），我们一起喝了一杯酒，然后我就在回家的路上……

(The horse neighs.)
（马嘶鸣。）

THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
马：呼呼呼呼！呼呼呼回家！

CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen’s and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs) Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?
科尼·凯勒：当然，是我们的贾维贝汉在我们把两个广告留在科恩夫人店后告诉我的，我让他停下来看看。 （他笑了）清醒的灵车司机是个特长。我会送他回家吗？他在哪里闲逛？在卡布拉的某个地方，什么？

BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
布鲁姆：不，在桑迪科夫，我相信，从他透露的情况来看。

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)
（史蒂芬俯卧，对着星星呼吸。科尼·凯莱赫斜视着，慢吞吞地对着马。布鲁姆，阴郁地，隐约出现。）

CORNY KELLEHER: (Scratches his nape) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen) Eh! (He calls again) Eh! He’s covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.
科尼·凯勒：（抓抓后颈）桑迪科夫！ （他弯下腰，对斯蒂芬喊道）呃！ （他又叫了一声）呃！无论如何，他身上都沾满了刨花。小心他们不要从他身上拿走任何东西。

BLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
布鲁姆：不，不，不。我有他的钱和他的帽子，并坚持下去。

CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I’ll shove along. (He laughs) I’ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!
科尼·凯勒：啊，好吧，他会克服的。骨头没有折断。好吧，我就一起推吧。 （他笑）我早上有个约会。埋葬死者。安全到家！

THE HORSE: (Neighs) Hohohohohome.
马：（嘶嘶声）呼呼呼呼回家。

BLOOM: Good night. I’ll just wait and take him along in a few …
布鲁姆：晚安。我就等着，过几天就带他一起去……

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)
（科尼·凯莱赫回到外面的车旁，上了车。马具叮当作响。）

CORNY KELLEHER: (From the car, standing) Night.
科尼·凯勒：（从车里站起来）晚上。

BLOOM: Night.
布鲁姆：晚上。

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)
（贾维甩开缰绳，鼓励地举起鞭子。汽车和马缓慢地、笨拙地后退，然后转身。侧座上的科尼·凯莱赫来回摇着头，对布鲁姆的困境表示笑意。贾维也加入了无声的哑剧。远处的座位上传来欢乐的点头声。布卢姆摇摇头，无言地笑着回答。科尼·凯莱赫用拇指和手掌安慰说，两个鲍比会让睡眠继续下去，以完成其他要做的事情。布卢姆缓慢地点头，表达了他的感激之情这正是史蒂芬所需要的。汽车在 tooraloom 车道的拐角处叮当作响。Corny Kelleher 再次用手安抚。Bloom 用手安抚 Corny Kelleher，他放心。叮当作响的蹄子和叮当响的马具随着它们的 tooralooloo 变得越来越微弱。卢卢躺着。布卢姆手里拿着斯蒂芬的帽子，上面装饰着刨花和白蜡木，犹豫不决。然后他向他弯下腰，摇晃他的肩膀。）

BLOOM: Eh! Ho! (There is no answer; he bends again) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!
布鲁姆：呃！嗬！ （没有回答；他再次弯下腰）迪达勒斯先生！ （无人接听）如果你打电话的话，名字。梦游者。 （他再次弯下身子，犹豫着，把嘴靠近那倒下的人的脸）史蒂芬！ （没有回应。他又打电话了。） 斯蒂芬！

STEPHEN: (Groans) Who? Black panther. Vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels)
斯蒂芬：（呻吟）谁？黑豹。吸血鬼。 （他叹了口气，伸了个懒腰，然后用长长的元音低声呢喃）

Who … drive … Fergus now
现在谁……驾驶……弗格斯

And pierce … wood’s woven shade? …
还有刺穿……木头编织的阴影？ ……

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)
（他转向左侧，叹了口气，弯下身子。）

BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen’s waistcoat) To breathe. (He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens) What?
布鲁姆：诗歌。受过良好教育。遗憾。 （他再次弯下腰，解开斯蒂芬背心的纽扣）呼吸。 （他用轻柔的手和手指刷掉斯蒂芬衣服上的木屑）一英镑七。反正没受伤。 （他听）什么？

STEPHEN: (Murmurs)
史蒂芬：（低声）

… shadows … the woods
……阴影……树林

… white breast … dim sea.
……白色的胸脯……昏暗的大海。

(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen’s face and form.)
（他伸出双臂，再次叹了口气，卷起身体。布卢姆拿着帽子和梣木，站直了。远处有一只狗在吠叫。布卢姆抓紧了又松开了梣木。他低头看着斯蒂芬的脸， .)

BLOOM: (Communes with the night) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. (He murmurs) … swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts … (He murmurs) … in the rough sands of the sea … a cabletow’s length from the shore … where the tide ebbs … and flows …
布鲁姆：（与夜晚交流）脸让我想起了他可怜的母亲。阴凉的树林里。深邃的白色乳房。弗格森，我想我明白了。一个女孩。某个女孩。最好的事情可能发生在他身上。 （他低声）……发誓我将永远欢呼，永远隐藏，永远不会透露，任何一个或多个部分，艺术或艺术……（他低声）……在大海的粗糙沙子中……距海岸一缆索长度……潮汐的地方潮起潮落……又潮起潮落……

(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)
（他沉默、深思熟虑、警觉地站岗，手指放在嘴唇上，摆出秘密大师的姿态。黑暗的墙壁上慢慢出现了一个人影，一个十一岁的仙女男孩，一个被绑架的幻形灵，穿着带有玻璃的伊顿公学套装鞋子和小青铜头盔，手里拿着一本书。他从右向左读，听不见，微笑着，亲吻着书页。）

BLOOM: (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly) Rudy!
布卢姆：（大吃一惊，小声叫道）鲁迪！

RUDY: (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)
鲁迪：（无视地注视着布鲁姆的眼睛，继续阅读、亲吻、微笑。他有一张精致的紫红色脸。他的西装上有钻石和红宝石纽扣。他空着的左手握着一根细长的象牙手杖，上面有紫罗兰色的手杖。蝴蝶结。一件白色小羊皮从他的背心口袋里露出来。）

三、

Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His (Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s. But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
准备好做其他事情后，布卢姆先生掸掉了大部分刨花，把帽子和梣木递给了斯蒂芬，并以正统的撒玛利亚方式让他振作起来，这是他非常需要的。他（斯蒂芬）的头脑并不完全是你所说的徘徊，但有点不稳定，考虑到当时的时间，他表达了想要喝点饮料给布鲁姆先生的想法，而且没有瓦特里水泵可供他们洗澡，更不用说饮酒目的突然想到了一个权宜之计，即立即建议出租车司机的避难所（所谓的避难所）的适当性，该避难所距离巴特桥（Butt Bridge）几乎一箭之遥，在那里他们可能会找到一些牛奶和苏打水或矿物质形式的饮料。但如何到达那里是一个难题。有一瞬间，他相当困惑，但由于他有责任就这个问题采取一些措施，他思考着合适的方式和方法，期间斯蒂芬不断地打哈欠。就他所见，他的脸色相当苍白，因此他想到，最好是得到一些描述，以回答他们当时的情况，他们俩都被编辑了，尤其是斯蒂芬，总是假设有这样的东西被发现。因此，在刷牙之类的一些准备工作之后，尽管他忘记拿起那块沾满肥皂的手帕，因为它在剃须线上完成了自耕农的工作，他们还是一起沿着海狸街，或者更准确地说，沿着小巷走到了那儿。蹄铁匠店和蒙哥马利街拐角处的马厩里明显散发着恶臭的气氛，他们从那里向左行驶，进入丹·伯金街拐角处的亚眠街。 但正如他自信地预料到的那样，除了一辆四轮车之外，在任何地方都看不到耶户在招租的迹象，这辆四轮车可能是在北极星酒店外被一些在狂欢中的人雇用的，而且没有任何迹象表明它移动了四分之一当布卢姆先生不是一个专业的口哨手时，他试图通过发出一种口哨声来欢呼，他将双臂拱在头上，两次。

This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but.put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.
这是一个进退两难的局面，但是，根据常识，显然没有什么办法，只能以良好的态度面对这件事，并接受他们相应的做法。于是，他们绕着马利特店和信号屋转了一圈，很快就到达了，他们被迫朝亚眠街道铁路终点站的方向前进，布卢姆先生因裤子后一颗纽扣的情况而陷入困境，改变这句古老的格言尽管他走上了所有按钮的道路，但彻底进入了事物的精神，他英勇地淡化了这次不幸。因此，由于他们俩的时间都不是特别紧迫，而且碰巧，自从木星普鲁威斯最近造访后天气转晴以来，气温也变得凉爽起来，他们就轻轻松松地走过空车等候的地方，没有车费，也没有车费。碰巧一辆都柏林联合电车公司的撒沙车正要回来，老人向他的同伴讲述了他不久前真正奇迹般地逃脱的事件。他们经过了大北方火车站的正门，这是贝尔法斯特的起点，当然，在这么晚的时候，所有的交通都暂停了，并经过了太平间的后门（一个不太吸引人的地方，更不用说可怕的程度了） （尤其是在晚上）最终到达了码头酒馆，并在适当的时候转向商店街，以其 C 区警察局而闻名。 在这一点和贝雷斯福德广场目前没有灯光的高仓库之间，斯蒂芬想到了易卜生，与贝尔德的石匠在他的脑海中不知何故在塔尔博特广场联系在一起，首先向右转，而另一个充当他的fidus的阿查特斯吸气詹姆斯·洛克（James Rourke）的城市面包店的气味与他们所在的地方非常接近，这确实是我们日常面包的非常美味的气味，在所有公共商品中最主要和最不可缺少的。面包，生活的支柱，赚取你的面包，哦，告诉我哪里有精美的面包，据说在洛克面包店。

En route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the
在去他那沉默寡言的路上，不要说得太过分，还没有完全清醒的同伴布卢姆先生无论如何都完全拥有他的能力，从未如此，事实上清醒得令人作呕，说了一句警告的话夜城的危险，名声不佳的女人和膨胀的暴民，虽然不是一种习惯，但偶尔是不允许的，对于他这个年纪的年轻人来说，特别是如果他们养成了酗酒的习惯，这就是一个常见的死亡陷阱。在酒精的影响下，除非你懂得一点柔术以应对各种突发情况，因为如果你不小心的话，即使是一个背上的家伙也可能会踢出令人讨厌的一脚。当史蒂芬幸福地昏迷不醒时，科尼·凯莱赫出现在现场是非常幸运的，但对于在最后一刻出现的那个在间隙中的人来说，结局可能是他可能是事故病房的候选人，或者，如果失败了，第二天，托拜厄斯先生出庭，或者，他是律师，他想说的是，老沃尔，或者马霍尼，当他受到伤害时，这对一个小伙子来说简直就是毁灭。他提到这一事实的原因是，他非常不喜欢的许多警察在为国王服务时无可否认是不择手段的，正如布卢姆先生所说，他回忆起克兰布拉希尔街A区的一两个案件，准备发誓在十加仑的锅上打一个洞。需要时不会出现在现场，而是在城市安静的地方，例如彭布罗克路，

guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of l s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both
法律卫士的存在是显而易见的，显而易见的原因是他们的报酬是为了保护上层阶级。他评论的另一件事是为士兵配备随时可能爆炸的枪支或任何种类的随身武器，这等于煽动他们反对平民，万一他们因任何事情发生争执。他非常明智地坚持说，你浪费了你的时间，还有健康和性格，除此之外，还有对事物的挥霍狂，快时尚的女人带着很多l s逃跑了。 d.讨价还价中，最大的危险是你和谁喝醉了，不过，谈到令人烦恼的兴奋剂问题，他品尝了一杯精选的时令陈酿葡萄酒，因为既

nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confreres but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.
滋养、造血、拥有通便的美德（尤其是他坚信的上等勃艮第葡萄酒）仍然没有超过他总是划清界限的某个点，因为这只会导致周围的麻烦，更不用说你受到温柔的怜悯了其他人的实际情况。最重要的是，他对史蒂芬被他的所有酒吧狩猎同伙抛弃的行为做出了负面评论，除了一位，他的兄弟医疗人员在所有情况下都进行了最明显的诽谤。

—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.
——那个人就是犹大，史蒂芬说，到目前为止他还没有说过任何话。

Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.
讨论着这些和类似的话题，他们径直穿过海关大楼的后面，穿过环线桥下，岗哨或​​类似的东西前面燃烧的一盆焦炭吸引了他们相当滞后的脚步。斯蒂芬无缘无故地停下来，看着那堆光秃秃的鹅卵石，借着火盆发出的光，他只能在昏暗的哨所里辨认出公司看守人的黑影。他开始记起这件事已经发生过，或者有人提到过以前发生过，但他花了不小的努力才记起来，他在哨兵中认出了他父亲的老朋友古姆利。为了避免见面，他靠近铁路桥的柱子。

—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
——有人向你致敬，布卢姆先生说。

A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling:
一个中等身材的人物显然在拱门下徘徊，再次敬礼，喊道：

—Night!
-夜晚！

Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.
斯蒂芬当然开始感到头晕，然后停下来回敬。布鲁姆先生出于固有的微妙动机，因为他始终相信专注于自己的事情，所以他离开了，但仍然保持着焦虑，尽管一点也不时髦。虽然这在都柏林地区很不寻常，但他知道，几乎没有什么可以维持生计的亡命之徒在国外拦路抢劫，通常会在市区外某个僻静的地方用手枪指着和平行人的头来恐吓他们，这绝不是什么新鲜事。泰晤士河堤上饥饿的游荡者，他们可能会在那儿闲逛，或者只是掠夺者，随时准备带着他们能得到的任何东西逃跑，你的钱或你的生命，让你在那里指点道德，堵住嘴，绞死了。

Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.
斯蒂芬，就在那个搭话的人靠近的时候，尽管他还没有处于过度清醒的状态，但他自己也认出了科利的呼吸带有腐烂玉米汁的味道。有人称他为约翰·科利勋爵，他的家谱就是这样产生的。他是 G 部门督察科利（最近去世）的长子，科利娶了劳斯农民的女儿凯瑟琳·布罗菲。他的祖父新罗斯的帕特里克·迈克尔·科利娶了那里一位酒馆老板的遗孀，她的婚前姓氏是凯瑟琳（也是）塔尔博特。有传言（尽管未​​经证实）说她是塔尔博特·德·马拉海德勋爵的后裔，在他的宅邸中，无疑是同类中的一处精美住宅，非常值得一看，她的母亲或姑妈或某个亲戚，一个女人，作为据说，她非常美丽，很享受在盥洗室工作的荣幸。因此，这就是为什么现在对斯蒂芬说话的那个还比较年轻但放荡的人被一些喜欢开玩笑的人称为约翰·科利勋爵的原因。

Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.
他把斯蒂芬拉到一边，唱起惯常的悲伤小调。连买一晚住宿的钱都不多。他的朋友们都抛弃了他。此外，他还和莱内汉发生了争吵，并把他叫到史蒂芬面前，用血淋淋的棉签狠狠地骂他，还夹杂着一些其他不必要的表情。他失业了，恳求斯蒂芬告诉他在上帝的地球上哪里可以找到一些事情，任何事情去做。不，是厨房里母亲的女儿是房子继承人的养姐妹，或者他们通过母亲以某种方式联系在一起，如果整件事不是完全捏造的话，这两件事同时发生从开始到结束。无论如何，他都全力以赴了。

—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks.
——我不会只问你，他追问，我庄严宣誓，上帝知道我已经触礁了。

—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.
——斯蒂芬告诉他，明天或后天会有一份工作，在达尔基的一所男子学校担任绅士引座员。加勒特·迪西先生。尝试一下。你可能会提到我的名字。

—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.
——啊，上帝，科利回答道，当然我不能在学校教书，伙计。我从来都不是你们中的聪明人之一，他半笑着补充道。我在基督教兄弟的初中被困了两次。

—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
——我自己没有地方睡觉，斯蒂芬告诉他。

Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it.
科利在第一次爆发时倾向于怀疑这与史蒂芬因从街上带来一个该死的馅饼而被解雇有关。马尔伯勒街上有一间旅馆，马洛尼夫人家，但它只是一个晒黑的风格，充满了不受欢迎的东西，但麦康纳奇告诉他，你在温塔文街的黄铜角有一个足够体面的地方（这对那个人来说是遥远的暗示）培根修道士的称呼）为鲍勃。他也很饿，尽管他对此只字未提。

Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence. However haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.
尽管这样的事情每隔一个晚上或者很接近的时候就会发生一次，但从某种意义上说，斯蒂芬的感情还是战胜了他，尽管他知道科利的全新胡言乱语与其他人一样几乎不值得相信。然而，正如这位拉丁诗人所言，“haud ignarus malorum misseris succurrere disco etco etera”，特别是运气好的话，他会在每个月中的十六号之后得到他的螺丝费，事实上，这个月的日期是这个月的日期，尽管有一点点资金被拆除。但这个笑话的精华在于，科利的脑海里始终萦绕着这样一个念头：他生活在富裕之中，除了发放必需品之外无事可做。然而。无论如何，他把手插在口袋里，并不是想在那里找到任何食物，而是想借给他任何东西来代替，这样他就可以无论如何努力并获得足够的食物，但结果是令他懊恼的是，他发现自己的现金不见了。几块碎饼干都是他调查的结果。他竭尽全力回忆自己是否已经输了，或者离开了，因为在那种意外情况下，这并不是一个令人愉快的监视，事实上恰恰相反。尽管他努力回忆，但他已经太疲惫了，无法进行彻底的搜索。关于饼干，他依稀记得。他想知道现在到底是谁给了他们，或者他在哪里买的。然而，在另一个口袋里，他发现了一些他在黑暗中猜测是便士的东西，但事实证明这是错误的。

—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
——那是半克朗，伙计，科利纠正道。

And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.
事实上，事实证明确实如此。不管怎样，斯蒂芬借给了他其中一张。

—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one time. Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.
——谢谢，科利回答，你是一位绅士。我会还你一次。和你在一起的是谁？我在卡姆登街的 Bleeding Horse 餐厅里见过他几次，和广告贴纸博伊兰在一起。你可能会为我们说几句好话，让我接受那里的邀请。我会带着一块三明治板，只有办公室里的女孩告诉我，接下来的三周他们已经满了，伙计。天哪，你得提前预订，伙计，你会以为这是卡尔罗莎的。无论如何，只要我能找到一份工作，即使是做十字路口的清扫工，我也不在乎。

Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.
随后，在两点和六点之后，他的心情不再那么低落，他告诉斯蒂芬有一个名叫巴格斯·科米斯基的人，他说斯蒂芬很了解富勒姆，船商的簿记员，那里过去经常在附近。莱格尔和奥玛拉一起回来了，还有一个结结巴巴地说着泰赫名字的小伙子。无论如何，他前天晚上被耽搁了，并因醉酒、扰乱秩序和拒绝与警察同行而被罚款十鲍勃。

Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.
与此同时，布卢姆先生一直在公司值班岗哨前的焦炭火盆附近的鹅卵石附近躲闪，他突然意识到，他显然是一个工作狂，正在安静地眨着四十个眼色，以达到他的目的。在都柏林睡觉时拥有自己的私人帐户。他时不时地用奇怪的眼光看着史蒂芬穿着完美的对话者，就好像他在某个地方见过那个贵族，尽管他无法如实陈述，也根本不知道何时见过。作为一个头脑冷静的人，他的敏锐观察力可以为不少人打分，他还评论说，他的帽子很破旧，衣服又很邋遢，这通常证明了他长期贫穷。显然，他是他的衣架之一，但就这一点而言，这只是一个全面掠夺他的邻居的问题，在每个深处，可以这么说，更深的深度，而且就这一点而言，如果这个人在街道本身碰巧在被告席上被判劳役，不管是否可以选择罚款，这都是一件非常罕见的事。无论如何，他在晚上或早上的那个时间里拦截人们的能力非常冷静。当然，相当厚。

The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
两人分手后，史蒂芬又回到了布卢姆先生身边，布鲁姆先生凭借他老练的眼光，并非没有察觉到自己已经屈服于另一个寄生虫的粗俗言语。提到这次遭遇，他笑着说，斯蒂芬，那就是：

—He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
——他运气不佳。他让我请你去请一个名叫博伊兰（Boylan）的人给他一份三明治工的工作。

At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:
布卢姆先生似乎对这一情报没有表现出什么兴趣，他心不在焉地朝一艘挖泥船的方向凝视了半秒钟左右，为埃布拉纳号的远近闻名的名字感到高兴，这艘船停泊在海关码头旁，很可能是从港口出来的。修复后，他闪烁其词地说道：

—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
——他们说，每个人都有自己的运气。现在你提到他的脸我很熟悉。但是，暂时先不谈这个，如果我不太好奇的话，他问道，你放弃了多少？

—Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.
——半克朗，斯蒂芬回答道。我敢说他需要它来睡觉。

—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question. And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?
——需要！布卢姆先生脱口而出，声称对这个情报一点也不感到惊讶，我非常相信这个说法，而且我保证他总是这样做。每个人根据他的需要或每个人根据他的行为。但是，谈论一般的事情，他微笑着补充道，你自己会睡在哪里吗？步行去桑迪科夫是不可能的。即使你这么做了，在 Westland Row 车站发生的事情之后你也进不去。就这样白白地在那里劳作。我无意对你指手画脚，但你为什么要离开你父亲的家呢？

—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.
——史蒂芬的回答是自找不幸。

—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.
——我最近见过你尊敬的父亲，布鲁姆先生外交地回来了，实际上是今天，或者严格准确地说，是昨天。他现在住在哪里？在谈话过程中我了解到他已经搬家了。

—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?
——我相信他在都柏林的某个地方，史蒂芬漫不经心地回答。为什么？

—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.
——布卢姆先生在谈到老迪达勒斯先生时说，他是一位才华横溢的人，在很多方面都是如此，而且如果有的话，他也是一位天生的健谈者。他对你感到非常自豪，这是理所当然的。你也许可以回去，他说道，仍然想着韦斯特兰街终点站的非常不愉快的场景，当时很明显，另外两个人，即穆里根，还有他的那个英国游客朋友，他最终杀死了他们的第三个同伴，显然，他们试图让斯蒂芬在混乱中溜走，就好像整个球站都属于他们一样，他们确实做到了。

There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.
然而这个建议并没有得到任何回应，事实上，史蒂芬的脑海里正忙着重现他上次看到的家庭壁炉，他的妹妹迪莉坐在壁炉边，头发垂下来，等待着一些消息。淡色的特立尼达壳可可放在被煤烟覆盖的水壶里，这样她和他就可以在星期五的鲱鱼（每人两便士加一个鸡蛋）给玛吉、布迪和猫凯蒂吃完后，用燕麦片水喝牛奶。与此同时，在碾压机下，在一块牛皮纸上吞下一堆蛋壳、烧焦的鱼头和骨头，按照教会的第三条戒律，在规定的日子里禁食和禁欲，如果没有紧张的话，就在余烬日或类似的东西。

—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.
——不，布卢姆先生再次重复道，如果我处于你的处境，我个人不会对你那位贡献了幽默元素的恩惠伙伴马里根博士寄予太多信任，他是一位向导、哲学家和朋友。他知道他的面包的哪一面涂了黄油，尽管他很可能从未意识到没有规律的膳食会是什么样子。当然你没有像我一样注意到。但如果我知道有人在你的饮料中加入了一小撮烟草或麻醉剂是为了某些不可告人的目的，我一点也不感到惊讶。

He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.
然而，从他所听到的一切中，他了解到穆里根医生是一位多才多艺的全能人士，绝不仅仅局限于医学，他在他的领域中迅速脱颖而出，如果报道属实，他将公平地享受在医学领域蓬勃发展的实践。在不久的将来，作为一名托尼医生，他的服务会收取可观的费用，此外，他通过人工呼吸将那个溺水的人救出来，以及他们所说的在斯克里或马拉海德进行急救，这也是他的专业地位。他不得不承认，这是一个极其勇敢的行为，他无法给予太多的赞扬，所以坦率地说，他完全无法理解这件事背后的世俗原因，除非他把它归结为纯粹的咒骂或嫉妒。 ，纯粹而简单。

—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw o.ut.
——只不过这只是一件事，而他就是他们所说的“挖你的脑子”，他冒险把它扔掉。

The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.
他对斯蒂芬目前忧郁的表情所投的半关心半好奇的警惕目光，加上友善的目光，并没有让他明白，事实上，他根本没有弄清楚他是否让自己被严重迷惑了判断。他通过两三句低沉的言论或相反的方式看透了这件事，并出于某种原因或其他他自己最熟悉的原因或多或少地让事情发展了。极度贫困确实产生了这种影响，他更进一步推测，尽管他拥有很高的教育能力，但他在维持收支平衡方面遇到了不小的困难。

Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.
在男士公共小便池旁边，他们看到一辆冰淇淋车，周围有一群可能是意大利人正在激烈争吵，他们正在以一种特别生动的方式用他们活泼的语言摆脱滔滔不绝的表达，各方之间存在一些细微的分歧。

—Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!
—Puttana madonna，che ci dia i quattrini！何拉吉奥内？库洛罗托！

—Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano piu …
——Intendiamoci。中层空间 …

—Dice lui, pero!
——卢伊骰子，可是！

—Mezzo.
——梅佐。

—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!
——法拉布托！死了！

—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa piu …
——阿斯科塔妈妈！五次拉特斯塔皮乌 …

Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.
布卢姆先生和史蒂芬走进了马车夫的住所，这是一座朴实无华的木结构建筑，在此之前，他很少来过那里，前者之前曾向后者耳语过一些暗示，据说这里的主人是曾经著名的主人。剥山羊皮的菲茨哈里斯是无敌的，尽管他不能保证事实真相，而这些事实很可能没有一丝一毫的真实性。过了一会儿，我们的两个梦魇安全地坐在一个隐蔽的角落里，迎接我们的是那些明显杂七杂八的流浪者、流浪者和其他不伦不类的人类样本已经在那里从事饮食，他们的目光因谈话而多样化，对他们来说，他们似乎形成了明显好奇的对象。

—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.
——现在，布鲁姆先生碰着一杯咖啡，振振有词地建议打破僵局，我突然想到，你应该尝尝固体食物形状的东西，比如说，一卷某种描述的东西。

Accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice a propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:
因此，他的第一个举动就是以特有的冷静冷静地订购这些商品。粗略检查后，杂货店或装卸工或其他什么人的民众显然不满意地把目光转向别处，尽管其中一个留着红胡子、吸水、头发灰白的人，可能是一名水手，在将全神贯注的注意力转移到其他地方之前，仍然盯着看了相当长的一段时间。地上。布卢姆先生利用自己的言论自由权，他对有争议的语言只是略知一二，不过，可以肯定的是，他在沃利奥的问题上陷入了困境，他用听得见的语气向他的门徒提出了以下建议：街上的混战仍在激烈地进行着：

—A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! It is so melodious and full. Belladonna. Voglio.
——美丽的语言。我的意思是为了唱歌。你为什么不用那种语言写诗呢？贝拉·波伊特里亚！它是如此的悠扬而饱满。颠茄。沃廖。

Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:
斯蒂芬竭尽全力地打哈欠，全身都感到疲倦，他回答道：

—To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
——填满牛象的耳朵。他们正在为钱讨价还价。

—Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.
-是这样吗？布鲁姆先生问道。当然，他若有所思地附和道，内心反思，有比绝对必要的语言更多的语言可供选择，这可能只是围绕着它的南方魅力。

The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête-â-tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
庇护所的管理员在这场面对面的交谈中，在桌子上放了一杯沸腾的、标有咖啡标签的精选混合物，还有一个相当古老的面包样本，或者看起来是这样。之后，他退到了柜台，布卢姆先生决定稍后再仔细地看他一眼，以免显得如此。出于这个原因，他鼓励斯蒂芬继续用他的眼睛，而他则偷偷地把暂时被称为咖啡的杯子逐渐推近他，以完成荣誉。

—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What’s in a name?
——声音是骗人的，史蒂芬停顿了一会儿后说道，就像名字一样。西塞罗，波德莫尔。拿破仑，古德博迪先生。天哪，道尔先生。莎士比亚和墨菲一样常见。名字里有什么？

—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
——是的，当然，布鲁姆先生毫不掩饰地同意了。当然。他补充道，我们的名字也被改变了，推动了所谓的“滚动”。

The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:
红胡子水手密切注视着新来的人，他登上了史蒂芬，他特别挑选了斯蒂芬来引起注意，直截了当地问道：

—And what might your name be?
——你的名字可能是什么？

Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:
就在紧要关头，布卢姆先生碰了碰他同伴的靴子，但斯蒂芬显然无视来自意想不到的地方的温暖压力，回答道：

—Dedalus.
——德达勒斯。

The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.
水手用一双昏昏欲睡、眼袋大的眼睛沉重地盯着他，眼睛因过度使用啤酒（最好是老荷兰酒和水）而变得肿胀。

—You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
——你认识西蒙·迪达勒斯吗？他详细问道。

—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.
——我听说过他，斯蒂芬说。

Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.
布卢姆先生一时间茫然了，他看到其他人显然也在偷听。

—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.
——他是爱尔兰人，海员大胆地肯定道，仍然以同样的方式凝视着并点点头。都是爱尔兰人。

—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
——史蒂芬重新加入，太爱尔兰人了。

As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:
至于布卢姆先生，他对整个事情一无所知，他只是在问自己这可能有什么联系，这时水手自愿转向避难所的其他居住者说道：

—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.
——我看见他在距他肩膀五十码的地方从两个瓶子里射出两个鸡蛋。左手死射。

Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
尽管他偶尔会结巴，而且手势也很笨拙，但他还是尽力解释了。

—Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
——比如说，那里有瓶子。测量了五十码。瓶子上有鸡蛋。将枪架在肩上。目标。

He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
他将身体转了半圈，完全闭上了右眼。然后他把脸歪到一边，用一种不讨人喜欢的表情瞪着夜色。

—Pom! he then shouted once.
——噗！然后他喊了一次。

The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.
所有观众都在等待，期待着再次爆炸，因为还会有更多的鸡蛋。

—Pom! he shouted twice.
——噗！他喊了两声。

Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:
蛋二明显被拆了，他点头眨了眨眼，嗜血地补充道：

—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
——水牛比尔开枪杀人，

Never missed nor he never will.
从来没有错过，也永远不会。

A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.
接下来是一阵沉默，直到布卢姆先生为了讨好而想问他这是否是为了像比斯利这样的射击比赛。

—Beg pardon, the sailor said.
——请原谅，水手说。

—Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
-很久以前？布卢姆先生毫不犹豫地追了上去。

—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.
——为什么，水手回答道，在钻石切割钻石的魔力影响下，心情得到了一定程度的放松，可能就是十年的事了。他随亨格勒皇家马戏团周游世界。我在斯德哥尔摩见过他这样做。

—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
——奇怪的巧合，布卢姆先生毫不引人注目地向史蒂芬吐露心声。

—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
——墨菲是我的名字，水手继续说道。卡里加洛 (Carrigaloe) 的 D. B. 墨菲 (D. B. Murphy)。知道那是哪里吗？

—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.
——皇后镇港口，斯蒂芬回答道。

—That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’s where I hails from. I belongs there. That’s where I hails from. My little woman’s down there. She’s waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about.
——没错，水手说道。卡姆登堡和卡莱尔堡。这就是我来自的地方。我属于那里。这就是我来自的地方。我的小女人就在那里。她在等我，我知道。为了英格兰、为了家园、为了美丽。她是我真正的妻子，我已经七年没有见过她了，一直在航行。

Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.
布卢姆先生可以很容易地想象出他出现在这个场景中，在欺骗了戴维·琼斯之后回到水手的路边屏蔽，一个月亮盲的雨夜。满世界找老婆。有很多关于爱丽丝·本·博尔特这个特定话题的故事，伊诺克·雅顿和瑞普·范·温克尔，还有附近的人还记得曹克·奥利里吗，这是可怜的约翰·凯西​​最喜欢、最难的朗诵作品，而且有点完美诗歌以它自己的小方式。不管离家出走的妻子回来了，不管他多么关心缺席者。窗外的脸！当他终于把录音带拿出来时，他感到多么惊讶，可怕的事实让他明白了，他的另一半在他的感情中遭到了破坏。你没想到我会来，但我留下来并重新开始。她坐在同一个炉边，一个草寡妇。相信我已经死了，摇摇晃晃地躺在深渊的摇篮里。坐在那儿的是丘布叔叔或汤姆金叔叔，视情况而定，他是皇冠和锚的酒馆老板，穿着衬衫，吃着牛腰肉和洋葱。没有给父亲的椅子。兄弟！风！她的新出生的孩子躺在她的膝盖上，是一个死后的孩子。具有高ro！还有兰迪罗！还有我奔腾的泪流满面的坦迪，哦！向不可避免的事情低头。逆来顺受。我仍然非常爱你伤心欲绝的丈夫 D B Murphy。

The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:
这名水手看上去几乎不是都柏林居民，他向其中一位水手提出请求：

—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?
——你身上就没有闲人吗？

The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.
贾维当时还没有说话，但守门员从他挂在钉子上的好夹克上取下了一个塞子模具，然后将所需的物品从一个手传递到另一个手。

—Thank you, the sailor said.
——谢谢你，水手说。

He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
他把钱放进嘴里，一边咀嚼，一边缓慢地结巴着，继续说道：

—We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There’s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.
——我们今天早上十一点钟来的。来自布里奇沃特的三大师罗斯文用砖块。我运送过去。今天下午就还清了。这是我的出院情况。看？ D.B.墨菲. A.B.S.

In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.
为了证实这一说法，他从内袋里掏出一份看起来不太干净的折叠文件，递给他的邻居。

—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.
——你一定已经见过不少世面了，看门人靠在柜台上说道。

—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilyou. That’s how the Russians prays.
——为什么呢，水手想了想后回答说，自从我第一次加入以来，我已经绕了一些圈子了。我当时在红海。我去过中国、北美和南美。我们在一次航行中被海盗追赶。我见过很多冰山，咆哮者。我在斯德哥尔摩、黑海、达达尼尔海峡，在道尔顿船长的带领下，他是有史以来最出色的击沉船只的人。我看到了俄罗斯。 Gospodi pomilyou。俄罗斯人就是这样祈祷的。

—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.
——你看到了奇怪的景象，别说话，放进罐子里。

—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.
——为什么，水手一边说，一边移开了被咬坏的塞子。我也见过一些奇怪的事情，有起有落。我看到鳄鱼咬住了锚的尾翼，就像我咀嚼英镑一样。

He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:
他从嘴里取出浆糊状的液体，用牙齿咬住，狠狠地咬了一口：

—Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.
——可汗！像那样。我在秘鲁看到食人兽，它们吃尸体和马的肝脏。看这里。他们来了。我的一个朋友发给我的。

He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.
他从里面的口袋里摸出一张明信片，它似乎是一个储藏室，然后把它推到桌子上。上面的印刷品写着：Choza de Indios。玻利维亚贝尼。

All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
所有人的注意力都集中在所展示的场景上，一群穿着条纹缠腰布的野蛮妇女，蹲在一些原始的柳条棚屋外，眨着眼睛，吃奶，皱着眉头，睡在一群婴儿（肯定有不少个）中。

—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children.
——整天嚼古柯，交流防水布补充道。胃像面包刨丝器。当他们无法再生育孩子时，就会切断他们的联系。

See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw.
看到他们光着身子坐在那儿，生吃死马的肝脏。

His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.
他的明信片在几分钟内（甚至更长时间）证明了对新手先生们的吸引力。

—Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.
—知道如何阻止它们吗？他泛泛地询问道。

Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
没有人主动发表声明，他眨了眨眼，说道：

—Glass. That boggles ‘em. Glass.
-玻璃。这让他们感到困惑。玻璃。

Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.
布卢姆先生没有表现出惊讶，而是毫不夸张地翻过卡片，仔细阅读了部分被涂掉的地址和邮戳。其经营地址如下：Tarjeta Postal、Señor A Boudin、Galeria Becche、圣地亚哥、智利。显然没有任何消息，因为他特别注意了。尽管他并不相信所叙述的耸人听闻的故事（或者尽管威廉·泰尔和《马里塔纳》中描述的拉扎里洛-唐·塞萨尔·德·巴赞事件中的夹蛋交易，当时前者的球穿过了后者的帽子），但他发现了两者之间的差异他的名字（假设他是他所代表的那个人，并且不是在某个地方严格遵守指南针后以虚假的名义航行）和信件的虚构收件人，这使他对我们朋友的诚意产生了一些怀疑。在某种程度上提醒了他一个长期珍视的计划，他打算有一天实现某个周三或周六通过远海前往伦敦的旅行，并不是说他曾经进行过广泛的旅行，但他本质上是一个天生的冒险家，尽管他是一个天生的冒险家。命运的捉弄，他一直是个旱鸭子，除非你说去霍利黑德，那是他最长的一次。马丁·坎宁安（Martin Cunningham）经常说他会通过伊根（Egan）进行传球，但总会出现一些失误或其他问题，最终导致该计划失败。但即使假设这确实是为了满足需要并让博伊德心碎，考虑到去穆林加尔的票价是五块钱和六块钱，往返的费用是五块钱和六块钱，在钱包允许的情况下，外面的钱也没有那么贵。 由于臭氧令人振奋，这次旅行对健康有益，而且在各方面都非常愉快，特别是对于一个肝脏不正常的小伙子来说，沿途参观了普利茅斯、法尔茅斯、南安普顿等不同的地方，最终获得了有益的体验。游览伟大大都市的景点，我们现代巴比伦的奇观，毫无疑问，他会在那里看到最大的进步，塔楼，修道院，公园巷的财富，以重新认识。另一件让他觉得绝非坏主意的事情是，他可能会在现场四处看看，看看是否试图安排一场夏季音乐巡回演唱会，其中包括最著名的度假胜地，马盖特，有混合浴场和一流的水疗中心。和水疗中心、伊斯特本、斯卡伯勒、马盖特等，美丽的伯恩茅斯、海峡群岛和类似的宝石地点，这些地方可能会带来很高的回报。当然，如果是一家破洞、角落刮伤的公司或当地女士在工作，请见证 C P M’Coy 夫人把你的手提箱借给我，我会把票寄给你。不，一流的东西，全明星的爱尔兰种姓，特威迪花大歌剧团和他自己的合法配偶作为女主角，作为对埃尔斯特·格莱姆斯和喜怒无常的反击，完全简单的事情，他对此非常乐观成功，在当地报纸上吹嘘可以由一些有一点活力的人来管理，他们可以拉动不可或缺的电线，从而将工作与娱乐结合起来。但谁呢？这就是问题所在。此外，虽然实际上并不是积极的，但他突然想到，在开辟新航线方面将开辟一个广阔的领域，以跟上时代的步伐，就菲什加德-罗斯莱尔航线而言，这条航线，有人提出，再次出现在世界上。塔皮斯在迂回部门与通常数量的繁文缛节和磨蹭的软弱的老夫和笨蛋一般。对于推动和企业来说，这无疑是一个很好的机会，可以满足广大公众、普通人，即布朗、罗宾逊公司的旅行需求。

It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the coup d’oeil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.
从表面上看，这是一个令人遗憾和荒谬的话题，当系统确实需要加强时，街上的人却因为区区几英镑的问题而被禁止进入我们自夸的社会，这对我们这个自夸的社会来说是一个不小的责备。多看看他们生活的世界，而不是自从我那个固执己见的老家伙娶我为妻以来，就一直把自己关在家里。毕竟，挂吧，他们度过了十一个月甚至更单调的日子，在经历了夏季城市生活的磨砺之后，值得彻底改变场地，以便在大自然处于其壮观的最佳状态时选择一个新的租约。生活。 对于度假者来说，在自己的岛屿上也有同样绝佳的机会，令人愉快的森林景点可以恢复活力，提供大量的景点以及都柏林及其周边地区及其风景如画的环境的系统的提神补品，甚至还有蒸汽电车前往的普拉普卡（Poulaphouca），但也远离威克洛的疯狂人群，正确地称为爱尔兰花园，只要它不倒塌，这里就是老年驾驶者的理想社区，而且在多尼戈尔的荒野中，如果报道属实，那是一场政变非常宏伟，尽管最后提到的地点并不容易到达，因此游客的涌入还没有达到它可能考虑从中获得的信号效益，而霍斯及其历史协会和其他，西尔肯·托马斯，格蕾丝·奥'马利，乔治四世，海拔数百英尺的杜鹃花是各种类型和条件的男人最喜欢出没的地方，尤其是在年轻人幻想的春天，尽管它有自己的死亡人数，通常是故意或意外地从悬崖上掉下来顺便说一下，他们的左腿距离柱子只有大约三刻钟的路程。当然，可以说，现代旅游还处于起步阶段，住宿条件还有很多不足之处。对他来说，出于好奇的动机来理解这一点很有趣，纯粹而简单的是，是否是交通创造了路线，反之亦然，或者实际上是两侧。他把卡片的另一面（照片）翻过来，然后把它递给了斯蒂芬。

—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.
——有一次，我看到一个中国人，勇敢的叙述者说，他有像腻子一样的小药丸，他把它们放在水里，打开后，每颗药丸都是不同的。一个是船，另一个是房子，另一个是花。他开胃地补充道，你的汤里会煮老鼠，中国佬也会。

Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.
环球旅行家可能察觉到他们脸上露出怀疑的表情，继续他的冒险之旅。

—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.
——我在的里雅斯特看到一名男子被一名意大利小伙子杀害。背后插刀。刀就这样。

Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.
说话间，他拿出一把很符合他性格的危险折刀，握在了引人注目的位置。

—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your God, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.
——在一家敲门声店里，有两个走私犯之间的较量。那家伙躲在门后，跟在他身后。像那样。他说，准备好迎接你的上帝吧。楚克！它进入了他的背部，一直到屁股。

His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.
他那沉重的目光，昏昏欲睡地四处游荡，有点无视他们进一步的问题，即使他们有机会想问。

—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.
——那是一块好钢，他重复道，一边检查着他可怕的细剑。

After which harrowing denouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.
在这足以让最坚强的人感到震惊的悲惨结局之后，他折断了刀片，并将有问题的武器像以前一样收进了他的恐怖之室，否则就是口袋里。

—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.
——他们非常适合冷钢，一个显然一无所知的人为了他们所有人的利益说道。所以他们认为公园里无敌杀人案是外国人干的，因为他们用的是刀。

At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very!
听到这句话，B先生和史蒂芬显然本着“无知就是福”的精神，各自以自己独特的方式，本能地交换了意味深长的眼神，然而，这是一种严格的宗教沉默，朝着皮肤-the-山羊，又名饲养员，毫发无伤地从他的锅炉里喷出液体。他那张高深莫测的脸确实是一件艺术品，本身就是一件完美的研究，可怜的描述，给人的印象是他一点也不明白正在发生的事情。搞笑，非常！

There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives choza de, another the seaman’s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.
接下来是一段较长的停顿。一个人断断续续地读书，开始写一本被咖啡弄脏的晚间日记，另一个人则写着当地人的 choza de 卡片，另一个人则是海员的退伍军人。就布鲁姆先生个人而言，他只是在沉思。他清楚地记得所提到的事件发生的时间以及昨天，大约是几十年前，在土地问题的日子里，当时它席卷了文明世界，形象地说，八十年代初，正确的是八十岁，当时他刚满十五岁。

—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.
——哎呀，老大，水手闯进来了。把文件还给我们。

The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.
请求得到满足后，他用爪子把它们抓了起来。

—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.
——你见过直布罗陀的岩石吗？布卢姆先生问道。

The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.
水手做了个鬼脸，咀嚼着，其方式可能被解读为是、是或不是。

—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.
——啊，你也碰过那里，布卢姆先生说，欧罗巴点，他以为他碰过，希望漫游车能通过一些记忆，但他没有这么做，只是让一股喷射物喷到锯末里，然后带着一种慵懒的轻蔑态度摇了摇头。

—What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the boats?
——那是哪一年的事情呢？ B先生审问道。你还记得那些船吗？

Our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:
我们的水手饥肠辘辘地咀嚼了一会儿，然后回答道：

—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.
——我厌倦了海里的那些岩石，他说，还有小船。一直都是盐垃圾。

Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.
看上去很累，他停了下来。发问者意识到他不太可能从这样一个狡猾的老顾客那里得到很多零钱，于是开始胡言乱语地对地球上广阔的水域进行了胡言乱语，只要说一下，就像随意浏览一下地图一样显露出来，足足覆盖了四分之三，他才彻底体会到什么是主宰海浪。不止一次，最低的十几个，在多利山的北牛附近，他注意到有一块废弃的老盐，显然是被遗弃的，习惯性地坐在墙上没有特别芬芳的大海附近，毫不在意地盯着它，它也盯着他，梦想着新鲜的树林和新的牧场，就像某个地方有人唱歌一样。这让他想知道为什么。也许他试图为自己找出这个秘密，在对极点上上下下挣扎，诸如此类，上上下下，好吧，不完全是下下，诱惑着命运。可能性是二十比零，这实际上根本不是什么秘密。 尽管如此，在不深入讨论事情的细节的情况下，雄辩的事实仍然是，大海就在那里，在它所有的荣耀中，在事物的自然过程中，某人或其他人必须在它上面航行，并在天意面前飞翔，尽管它只是展示人们通常如何设法将这种责任推给其他人，比如地狱的想法以及彩票和保险，它们的运行方式完全相同，因此，正是因为这个原因，如果没有其他救生艇周日是一个非常值得称赞的机构广大公众，无论生活在内陆还是海边（视情况而定），将其带回家，也应该向港务长和海岸警卫队表示感谢，他们必须操纵索具并推动和推进无论什么季节，爱尔兰都期望每个人都在风雨中度过，有时在冬天度过了一段可怕的时光，不要忘记爱尔兰的灯光，基什和其他地方，随时可能倾覆，他曾经绕过它和他的女儿一起经历了一些非常波涛汹涌的天气，更不用说暴风雨了。

—There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.
——有一个和我一起乘坐漫游者号航行的老海狗，他自己也是漫游者号，继续前行，上岸并找到了一份温和的工作，担任绅士的贴身男仆，每月六英镑。我穿的是他的裤子，他给了我一件油布和那把折刀。我很适合这份工作，刮胡子和刷牙。我讨厌到处闲逛。现在，我的儿子丹尼跑到了海边，他的母亲把他带到了科克的一家布店，在那里他可以轻松赚到钱。

—What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.
——他几岁了？一位听众问道，顺便说一下，从侧面看，他与镇书记亨利·坎贝尔有很远的相似之处，远离办公室的烦恼，当然没有洗过脸，衣着邋遢，鼻梁上有浓浓的鼻涂痕迹。附属物。

—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny? He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.
——为什么，水手缓慢而困惑地回答道，我的儿子丹尼？我猜他现在大概十八岁了。

The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.
斯基伯林的父亲随即用两只手撕开他那件灰色或不干净的衬衫，并在他的胸口上刮开，可以看到上面用蓝色墨水文了一个象征锚的图像。

—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It’s them black lads I objects to. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.
——布里奇沃特的那个铺位上有虱子，他说，肯定是疯了。明天或者后天我必须去洗个澡。我反对的是他们这些黑人小伙子。我讨厌那些混蛋。吸干你的血，他们就是这么做的。

Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.
看到他们都在看着他的胸口，他顺从地把衬衫拉得更开，这样，在这个古老的水手希望和休息的象征之上，他们就可以看到数字16和一个年轻人皱着眉头的侧脸。

—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.
——纹身，参展商解释道。这是当我们在道尔顿船长的带领下，在黑海敖德萨附近平静时完成的。伙计，安东尼奥的名字，就是这么做的。他就是他自己，一个希​​腊人。

—Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.
——做起来很疼吗？有人问水手。

That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway in his. Squeezing or.
然而，那个值得的人正在忙着收集周围的东西。不知何故在他的。挤压或。

—See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
——看这里，他一边说，一边给安东尼奥看。他在那里咒骂他的伴侣。他补充道，现在他就在那里，还是那个家伙，用手指拉扯皮肤，显然是有某种特殊的技巧，而且他还对着一则故事大笑。

And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.
事实上，那个名叫安东尼奥的年轻人铁青的脸看起来确实像是在强颜欢笑，这种奇怪的效果激起了所有人毫无保留的钦佩，包括这次伸了个懒腰的剥山羊皮。

—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.
——唉，唉，水手叹了口气，低头看着自己男子气概的胸膛。他也走了。后来被鲨鱼吃掉了。哎，哎。

He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.
他松开了皮肤，侧脸又恢复了之前的正常表情。

—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.
——干得漂亮，一位码头工人说。

—And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.
——这个号码是做什么用的？二号乐福鞋受到质疑。

—Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.
——被活活吃掉了？第三个人问水手。

—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.
——唉，唉，后一个人物又叹了口气，这次更加高兴了，只是朝着询问号码的人的方向短暂地露出了某种半微笑。吃。他是希腊人。

And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:
然后，考虑到他所谓的结局，他用相当绞刑架上的幽默补充道：

—As bad as old Antonio,
——和老安东尼奥一样糟糕，

For he left me on my ownio.
因为他让我独自一人。

The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.
一位戴着黑色草帽的街头女商人，面容呆滞，面容憔悴，歪歪扭扭地朝避难所的门外张望，显然是在独自侦察，目的是给她的磨坊带来更多的谷物。布卢姆先生几乎不知道该朝哪个方向看，他立刻转过身去，虽然心慌意乱，但表面上很平静，他从桌子上拿起了贾维（如果他是贾维）放在一边的修道院街风琴的粉红色床单，他拿起把它抬起来，看看纸是粉红色的，但为什么是粉红色的。他这样做的原因是，他在门外的那一刻认出了那天下午在奥蒙德码头上匆匆瞥见的那张脸，那个有点白痴的女人，即巷子里的女人，她知道那位穿着棕色服装的女士确实是和你（B女士）在一起，并请求给他洗澡的机会。另外，为什么洗涤看起来相当模糊而不是不，你的洗涤。坦率的态度仍然迫使他承认，他妻子在霍尔斯街弄脏了的内衣，女人也会洗，而且如果她们真的爱他，她们也会洗男人的类似衣服，上面写着布利和德雷珀的记号墨水（就是她的）。说，爱我，爱我的脏衬衫。就在那时，他正提心吊胆，更想要的是雌性的房间，而不是她的陪伴，所以当饲养员粗鲁地示意她离开时，他才真正松了口气。在《电讯晚报》的旁边，他在门边瞥见了她的脸，脸上带着一种疯狂的呆滞笑容，表明她并不完全在那儿，带着明显的乐趣看着一群注视着墨菲船长航海船的人。胸部，然后就不再有她了。

—The gunboat, the keeper said.
——炮艇，守门员说。

—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from …
——布鲁姆先生向史蒂芬吐露，从医学上来说，我说的是，像洛克医院里的那种散发着疾病恶臭的可怜生物怎么能不露脸地去招揽人，或者任何一个清醒的人，如果他重视自己的健康的话，他会怎么做？至少。不幸的生物！当然，我认为某个男人对她的状况负有最终责任。无论如何，无论原因是什么……

Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:
斯蒂芬没有注意到她，耸了耸肩，只是说道：

—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
——在这个国家，人们的销售量比她以往任何时候都多，而且生意兴隆。不要害怕那些出卖身体却没有能力购买灵魂的人。她是个坏商人。她买贵，卖便宜。

The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.
那位年长的男人，虽然无论如何都不是一个老处女，也不是一个正经的人，但他说，这无异于一场令人哭笑不得的丑闻，应该立刻停止说那种女人（更不用说任何老处女的神经质了）。在这个问题上），这是一种必要的罪恶，没有得到有关当局的许可和医学检查，这一点，他可以如实地声明，作为家长，他从一开始就是坚定的倡导者。他说，无论谁制定了这样的政策，并彻底解决了这个问题，都会给所有相关的人带来持久的好处。

—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?
——你作为一个好的天主教徒，他评论道，谈论身体和灵魂，相信灵魂。或者你指的是智力，脑力本身，与任何外部物体（桌子，让我们说，那个杯子）不同。我自己也相信这一点，因为有能力的人已经将其解释为灰质的卷积。否则我们永远不会有像 X 射线这样的发明。你？

Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:
史蒂芬被逼到了绝境，必须付出超人的记忆力才能集中注意力并记住，然后才能说：

—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.
——他们最权威地告诉我，这是一种简单的物质，因此不会腐烂。我明白，它将是不朽的，但它有可能被它的第一因消灭，据我所知，谁完全有能力将其添加到他的其他恶作剧的数量中，腐败本身和腐败因意外两者都存在被宫廷礼仪排除在外。

Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:
布卢姆先生完全默许了这一点的总体要点，尽管所涉及的神秘技巧有点超出了他的世俗深度，但他觉得有必要在简单、迅速的反驳的基础上提出异议：

—Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
-简单的？我不认为这是正确的词。当然，我承认，承认一点，你确实千载难逢地遇到了一个简单的灵魂。但我急于达到的是，例如发明伦琴所做的射线或像爱迪生那样的望远镜是一回事，尽管我相信这是在他的时代之前伽利略是那个人，我的意思是，这同样适用于法律，例如，关于电力等影响深远的自然现象，但如果说你相信超自然上帝的存在，那就是完全不同的颜色了。

—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.
——哦，斯蒂芬断言，除了间接证据之外，《圣经》中几条最著名的段落已经最终证明了这一点。

On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.
然而，在这个棘手的问题上，两人的观点发生了冲突，因为他们都在学校接受教育，而且在其他方​​面也有明显的年龄差异。

—Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief. I’m not so sure about that. That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like Hamlet and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you. Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got. Try a bit.
——曾经是？两人中经验较丰富的一个表示反对，并带着难以置信的微笑坚持自己原来的观点。我对此不太确定。这是每个人的看法的问题，在不涉及宗派方面的情况下，我请求在这方面与您不同。我的信念是，坦率地告诉你，这些内容都是真正的伪造品，很可能都是僧侣们放入的，或者这是我们国家诗人的一个大问题，他就像哈姆雷特和培根一样准确地写了它们，因为，你谁比我更了解你的莎士比亚，当然我不需要告诉你。顺便问一下，你不能喝那杯咖啡吗？让我搅拌一下。拿一块面包。这就像我们船长的一块伪装的砖头。仍然没有人能够给予他所没有的东西。尝试一下。

—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.
——不能，史蒂芬想办法出去，他的精神器官暂时拒绝进一步发号施令。

Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.
吹毛求疵是众所周知的坏帽子，布鲁姆先生认为最好搅拌或尝试从底部凝结的糖，并以近乎尖刻的态度反映在咖啡宫及其禁酒（和有利可图）工作上。可以肯定的是，它是一个合法的对象，而且超越了是或否，确实是一个美好的世界，像现在这样的庇护所，在夜间为流浪者禁酒排队，举办音乐会，戏剧性的夜晚和由合格的人士举办的有用讲座（免费入场）。下层阶级的人。另一方面，他有一个清晰而痛苦的回忆，他们付给他的妻子，马里昂·特威迪夫人，她曾经与此事有显着的联系，对于她的钢琴演奏来说，确实是一笔非常微薄的报酬。他强烈地相信，这个想法是做好事并赚取净利润，没有竞争可言。他记得在某个廉价餐馆里读到过，硫酸铜毒害了 SO4 或一些干豌豆中的其他物质，但他不记得是什么时候或在哪里发生的。不管怎样，对他来说，对所有食品进行检查、医学检查似乎比以往任何时候都更加必要，这可能是蒂布尔博士的维可可因所涉及的医学分析而流行的原因。

—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.
——现在就尝尝吧，他在谈到搅拌后的咖啡时大胆地说。

Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.
因此，无论如何，史蒂芬还是成功地尝到了它的味道，从把手拿起杯子时，杯子从棕色的水坑里摔出来，举起沉重的杯子，喝了一口令人讨厌的饮料。

—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.
——仍然是固体食物，他的天才敦促道，我是固体食物的坚持者，他唯一的原因是一点也不贪吃，而是将规律的膳食作为任何适当工作的必要条件，无论是脑力还是体力。你应该多吃固体食物。你会感觉自己是一个不同的人。

—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that knife. I can’t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.
——我可以吃液体，斯蒂芬说。但是哦，请帮我拿走那把刀。我看不出它的意义。这让我想起了罗马的历史。

Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.
布卢姆先生立即按照建议做了，拿走了那件有罪的物品，一把钝角柄的普通刀，在外行人看来，没有什么特别的罗马或古董的地方，他发现刀尖是它最不显眼的一点。

—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.
——我们共同朋友的故事就像他自己一样，布鲁姆先生在谈到刀子时对他的红颜知己低声说道。你认为他们是正品吗？他可以整夜连续几个小时纺这些纱线，然后像旧靴子一样躺着。看着他。

Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.
然而，尽管他的眼睛因睡意浓浓，海上的空气生活充满了许多可怕的事情和巧合，而且很有可能这不是完全捏造的，尽管乍一看并没有太多。他发自内心的所有恶搞都有可能是严格准确的福音。

He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.
自从他看向他之后，他就一直在打量着他面前的这个人和夏洛克福尔摩斯。虽然他是一个精力充沛、体力保存完好的人，但如果有点秃头的倾向，他前臂的切口中却有一些虚假的东西，暗示着他可能会被送进监狱，而且不需要太多的想象力就能将这样一个看起来怪异的标本与奥克姆和跑步机联系起来兄弟情谊。他甚至可能会为他的人做一些事情，假设这是他自己的情况，就像人们经常对别人做的那样，也就是说，他亲手杀了他，并在杜伦斯的邪恶中度过了他美好的四五年，更不用说安东尼奥人物了（与出自我们民族诗人笔下的同名戏剧人物无关）他以上述戏剧化的方式赎罪了他的罪行。另一方面，他可能只是虚张声势，这是一个可以原谅的弱点，因为遇到明显的都柏林居民，就像那些等待来自国外的消息的人一样，会吸引任何远洋航行的古代水手在双桅帆船赫斯珀洛斯等上拉长弓。归根结底，一个人关于自己的谎言可能无法与其他人编造的关于他的大量弥天大谎相提并论。

—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There’s an example again of simple souls.
——请注意，我并不是说这完全是一个纯粹的发明，他继续说道。类似的场景即使不是经常也偶尔会遇到。巨人，虽然相差甚远，但你偶尔会看到侏儒女王玛塞拉。在亨利街的那些蜡像中，我自己看到了一些阿兹特克人，他们被称为罗圈腿，如果你付钱给他们，他们就无法伸直腿，因为这里的肌肉，你看，他继续说道，向他的同伴示意了右膝后面的筋，或者你喜欢叫它们的东西，由于长期以这种方式坐着，被当作神来崇拜，因此完全无能为力。这又是一个简单灵魂的例子。

However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.
然而，回到朋友辛巴达和他可怕的冒险（他让他想起了路德维希，又名莱德维奇，当时他占据了欢乐号的董事会，而迈克尔·冈恩被认为是飞翔的荷兰人号的管理层，取得了巨大的成功，他的主机崇拜者蜂拥而至，每个人都蜂拥而至，通过任何类型的船只（无论是幽灵还是相反的）来听他讲话，在舞台上通常会有点平坦，火车也是如此），他承认，这没有什么本质上不相容的地方。相反，背后的刺伤很符合那些意大利人的风格，尽管坦率地说，他仍然可以自由地以鱼的方式接纳那些冰淇淋和炸薯条，更不用说附近小意大利的薯片品种等等了。库姆夫妇都是清醒、节俭、勤奋的人，只是可能有点太热衷于在晚上寻找其他人劝说的猫科动物必需的无害动物，以便第二天在安静和安静的环境下吃一顿美味的、多汁的、配上大蒜的塔金。他补充道，价格便宜。

—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character. That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.
——比如西班牙人，他继续说道，像老尼克一样冲动的性情，习惯于将法律掌握在自己手中，并用他们腹部携带的火药让你双倍安静。它通常来自炎热的气候。可以这么说，我的妻子是西班牙人，一半是西班牙人。事实上，如果她愿意的话，她实际上可以申请西班牙国籍，因为她出生在（严格意义上）西班牙，即直布罗陀。她有西班牙类型。相当黑，正常的黑发，黑色。我当然相信气候会影响性格。这就是为什么我问你是否用意大利语写诗。

—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.
——史蒂芬插嘴说，门口的人对十先令非常热衷。罗伯托·鲁巴·罗巴·苏阿。

—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.
——确实如此，布卢姆先生同上。

—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.
——然后，斯蒂芬盯着自己或某个不知名的听众，胡言乱语地说，我们有但丁的冲动和他爱上的等腰三角形波尔蒂纳里小姐，还有莱昂纳多和圣托马索·马斯蒂诺。

—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form. Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.
——这是融入血液的，布卢姆先生立刻同意了。一切都被太阳的血洗过。巧合的是，我今天碰巧在基尔代尔街博物馆 890，就在我们见面之前不久，如果我可以这样称呼它的话，我只是在看那里的那些古董雕像。臀部、胸部的比例极佳。你根本不会在这里攻击那些类型的女人。到处都有例外。是的，很帅，从某种程度上来说很漂亮，但我说的是女性形态。况且她们的衣着品位太少了，大多数，无论怎么说，都大大增强了女人的自然美。皱巴巴的丝袜，可能是我的一个缺点，但仍然是我讨厌看到的事情。

Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, goo collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course had his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.
然而，大家的兴趣开始有所减弱，然后其他人开始谈论海上事故、船只在雾中迷失、粘液与冰山相撞，诸如此类的事情。希帕霍伊当然有他自己的说法。他曾数次将海角翻折，并经受住了中国海域的季风（一种风），并经历了所有这些深海的危险，他宣称，有一种东西对他来说是坚定的，或者类似的说法，一种虔诚的信仰。他拥有的勋章救了他。

So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it Palme on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the Mona’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.
于是，在那之后，他们漂流到了当特岩石上的残骸，那艘命运多舛的挪威三桅帆船的残骸，暂时没人能想到她的名字，直到长得很像亨利·坎贝尔的贾维想起了布特斯敦海滩上的帕尔梅。那是那一年镇上的热门话题（阿尔伯特·威廉·奎尔为《爱尔兰时报》写了一首关于 910 独特优点的原创诗篇），浪花碾过她，岸上的人群惊恐万状，一片骚动。然后有人说了一些关于s的事情。 s。斯旺西的凯恩斯夫人号与莫纳号相撞，莫纳号在相当闷热的天气下逆风航行，在甲板上所有人员都在的情况下迷失了方向。没有提供任何援助。她的主人莫娜一家说，他担心防撞舱壁会塌陷。她的货舱里似乎没有水。

At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.
就在这个阶段，发生了一件事情。当他有必要展开礁石时，水手就让出了座位。

—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.
——让我向你鞠躬，伙计，他对他的邻居说，他的邻居刚刚轻轻地睡着了。

He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.
他沉重地踩着脚印，缓慢地迈着一种矮胖的步态走到门口，重重地踏下走出避难所的那一级台阶，向左走。当他正在确定自己的方位时，布卢姆先生注意到，当他站起来时，他从每个口袋里伸出了两瓶大概是船上的朗姆酒，供他燃烧的内部私人饮用，看到他拿出一瓶酒并打开了它的瓶塞或者拧开螺丝，将喷嘴放在嘴唇上，发出咕噜咕噜的声音，痛饮一大口。无法抑制的布鲁姆也敏锐地怀疑，这位老舞台表演者在以女性形象出现反吸引力后出去进行了一次演习，然而，这位女性的形象却消失得无影无踪，他可以通过紧张地察觉到他，当他的朗姆酒冲床的利用，在环线的桥墩和大梁上张开大口，远远超出了他的深度，当然，自他上次访问以来，一切都发生了根本性的改变，并且得到了很大的改善。一些看不见的人把他引向清洁委员会在各处设立的男用小便池，但在短暂的沉默之后，水手显然对它敬而远之，慢慢地靠近了附近。过了一会儿，他的舱底水溅到地上的声音显然惊醒了卡布兰克的一匹马。睡觉后，马蹄无论如何都会挖出新的立足点，马具叮当作响。 在他的岗亭里，公司石头的守望者被活焦炭的火盆稍微打扰了，尽管现在他们已经崩溃了，而且很快就崩溃了，但在严峻的现实中，除了前面提到的甘姆利之外，没有其他人，考虑到临时工作，现在实际上是在教区费率上帕特·托宾（Pat Tobin）以所有人类的概率从人类的指令中认识了他，然后在他的盒子里移动并拖着脚步，然后将他的四肢重新放入莫菲斯的怀抱中，这是对一个最受尊敬的人以最恶毒的形式提出的真正令人惊奇的强硬路线他一生都与人交往并熟悉体面的家庭舒适感，他每年收入高达 100 英镑，当然，这双管屁股继续做一般的鸭子和鸭子。他经常在没有任何乞讨的情况下把小镇涂成粉红色，现在已经是山穷水尽了。不用别人告诉他，他就喝酒了，这再次表明了一种道德：如果——不过，这是一个很大的假设——他设法克服了自己的特殊偏爱，那么他可能很容易就能做大生意。

All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.
与此同时，人们都在大声哀叹爱尔兰航运业的衰落，无论是沿海地区还是外国航运业，这些都是同一件事的重要组成部分。一艘帕尔格雷夫·墨菲号船在亚历山德拉盆地被推迟，这是当年唯一的一次下水活动。没错，港口就是没有船只停靠的地方。

There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait.
看门人说，那里有残骸和破坏者，他显然是事实。

What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.
他想查明的是，当沃辛顿先生或类似的名字提出戈尔韦港口计划时，为什么那艘船会撞上戈尔韦湾唯一的岩石，嗯？他建议他们询问当时的船长，英国政府为他当天的工作提供了多少棕榈油，即利华线的约翰·利华船长。

—Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.
——我说得对吗，船长？他向水手询问，水手现在已经结束了他的私人药剂和其余的努力而回来了。

That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:
那些值得闻到歌曲或歌词的传说的气味的人在可能的音乐中咆哮，但在几秒钟或三秒钟内以巨大的活力某种吟唱或其他。布卢姆先生敏锐的耳朵听到了他的声音，然后可能把塞子吐了出来（确实如此），所以他一定是在喝水和制水的时候把它暂时放在了拳头里，在液体着火后发现它有点酸。有问题。不管怎样，他在成功的奠酒和灌酒后滚了进来，给晚会带来了一种饮酒的气氛，喧闹地拖钓，就像一个名副其实的海鲜厨师的儿子：

—The biscuits was as hard as brass
——饼干像黄铜一样硬

And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.
牛肉就像罗得妻子的屁股一样盐。

O, Johnny Lever!
哦，约翰尼·利弗！

Johnny Lever, O!
约翰尼·利弗，哦！

After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.
之后，这个令人畏惧的标本终于到达了现场，并重新回到了座位上，他没有重重地坐在提供的表格上，而是沉下去了。剥山羊皮，假设他就是他，显然是怀着一把利斧，在爱尔兰的自然资源或他在冗长的论文中描述为最富有的国家的类似国家的自然资源上表达他的不满。在上帝的地球上，没有任何一个国家比英国优越，拥有大量煤炭，每年出口价值六百万磅的猪肉，黄油和鸡蛋之间有千万英镑，所有财富都被英国征税榨干了穷人总是花大钱，吞噬市场上最好的肉，同样地，还有更多剩余的蒸汽。他们的谈话因此变得普遍起来，大家都同意这是事实。他说，你可以在爱尔兰的土地上种植任何凡人的东西，而埃弗拉德上校就在纳文种植烟草。您在哪里可以找到像爱尔兰培根这样的地方？但清算的一天，他毫不含糊地表示，尽管强大的英格兰因犯罪而拥有权力，但她的声音已经完全垄断了所有谈话，即将到来。将会有一次跌倒，而且是历史上最严重的跌倒。他断言，德国人和日本人将会稍微看看。布尔人是终结的开始。布鲁马吉姆英格兰已经崩溃了，她的垮台将是爱尔兰，她的阿喀琉斯之踵，他向他们解释了希腊英雄阿喀琉斯的弱点，当他通过展示所提到的肌腱完全吸引了他们的注意力时，他的听众立即抓住了这一点。到他的靴子上。 他给每一个爱尔兰人的建议是：留在你出生的土地上，为爱尔兰工作，为爱尔兰生活。帕内尔说，爱尔兰无法饶恕她的一个儿子。

Silence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.
四周的寂静标志着他的结局的结束。这位冷漠的航海家听到这些可怕的消息，并没有惊慌。

—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.
——老板，采取一点行动，报复那颗毛坯钻石，显然对前述的老生常谈有点恼火。

To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.
守门员对此表示同意，但仍然坚持他的主要观点。

—Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we’ve got? Tell me that.
——军队中谁是最好的部队？头发花白的老兵愤怒地审问道。那么最好的跳投和赛车手呢？我们有最好的海军上将和将军吗？告诉我。

—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.
——爱尔兰人，作为选择，像坎贝尔一样反驳出租车司机，除了面部瑕疵。

—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic peasant. He’s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?
——没错，旧防水布证实了这一点。爱尔兰天主教农民。他是我们帝国的支柱。你认识杰姆·马林斯吗？

While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.
在允许他作为普通人提出个人意见的同时，守门人补充说，他对任何帝国，无论是我们的还是他的，都毫不关心，并且认为没有爱尔兰人值得为之服务。然后，当天气变得更热时，他们开始说一些暴躁的话，不用说，这对那些饶有兴趣地关注着武器通过的听众来说很有吸引力，只要他们不沉迷于相互指责和打架。

From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.
从多年来的内部消息来看，布卢姆先生相当倾向于对这一建议嗤之以鼻，认为这是令人震惊的胡言乱语，因为无论是否虔诚地希望这种完美实现，他都充分认识到这样一个事实，即他们的海峡对岸的邻居，除非他们是比他想象的更大的傻瓜，否则他们宁愿隐藏自己的力量，也不愿相反。这与某些方面的堂吉诃德式想法相当相似，即一亿年后姐妹岛的煤层将被耗尽，如果随着时间的推移，事实证明这就是猫如何跳跃的方式就此事个人而言，由于在此之前可能会发生许多与该问题同样相关的突发事件，因此强烈建议在此期间尽量充分利用两国的优势，即使两国相距甚远。另一个有趣的小点，用通俗的话来说，就是妓女和好友的恋情，这让他想起爱尔兰士兵经常为英格兰而战，事实上，更多的是与她作战。而现在，为什么呢？所以他们两人之间的场景，传闻中的那个地方的持牌人是或曾经是著名的无敌菲茨哈里斯，而另一个，显然是假的，强行提醒他用信心把戏趴着，假设，那就是，它被预先安排为旁观者，如果有的话，是人类灵魂的学生，其他人最少看到游戏。至于承租人或保管人，他可能根本不是另一个人，他（B.）情不自禁地感觉，最正确的是，最好给这样的人虾虎鱼，除非你完全是一个胡言乱语的白痴，拒绝与他们有任何关系，作为私人生活和他们重罪的黄金法则，总是有现在，丹尼曼有可能像丹尼斯或彼得·凯里一样站出来提出女王或国王的证据，但他完全否认了这一想法。除此之外，他原则上不喜欢那些不法行为和犯罪的职业。然而，尽管这种犯罪倾向从来没有以任何形式出现在他的心中，但他确实感受到了，不可否认（虽然内心保持着他本来的样子），他确实对一个真正挥舞着刀子的人产生了某种钦佩。冷钢，凭借他的政治信念的勇气（尽管，就个人而言，他永远不会成为任何此类事情的一方），与南方的那些爱情仇杀一样，拥有她或为她摇摆，当丈夫经常，在两人之间就她与另一位幸运的凡人的关系进行了一些交谈之后（他让两人看着），由于另一种婚后性行为，他将刀插入她的身体，对他心爱的人造成致命伤害，直到刚刚让他震惊的是，绰号“剥山羊皮”的菲茨只是为真正的暴行肇事者开车，因此，如果他被可靠地告知的话，他实际上并不是伏击的一方，事实上，伏击是辩解的一些法律名人救了他一命。无论如何，这已经是非常古老的历史了，至于我们的朋友，伪皮肤之类的人，他显然已经不再受到欢迎了。他应该要么自然死亡，要么死在高高的断头台上。就像女演员一样，总是积极地告别最后一场演出，然后再次微笑着上场。 当然，慷慨到了过分的地步，脾气暴躁，没有节约或任何类似的想法，总是为了影子而咬骨头。同样地，他非常敏锐地怀疑约翰尼·利弗先生摆脱了一些LSD。在老爱尔兰酒馆的愉快气氛中，他在码头周围巡视，然后回到艾琳，等等。至于另一个人，他不久前就听到过同样的行话，当时他告诉斯蒂芬他如何简单而有效地让罪犯闭嘴。

—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?
——他对某事或其他事情感到不满，伤害很大，但总的来说，脾气平和的人宣称，我漏掉了。他以一种激烈的方式攻击性地称我为犹太人。因此，我毫不偏离明显的事实，告诉他他的上帝，我的意思是基督，也是犹太人，他的所有家人都喜欢我，尽管实际上我不是。那是为他准备的。温和的回答可以消除愤怒。正如每个人都看到的那样，他没有为自己说一句话。难道我不对吗？

He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.
他长时间地凝视着斯蒂芬，对软弹劾感到胆怯、阴暗、骄傲，同时也带着恳求的目光，因为他似乎在以一种并不完全正确的方式收集信息。

—Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any other, secundum carnem.
——Ex quibus，斯蒂芬用不置可否的口音咕哝着，他们的两只或四只眼睛在交谈，克里斯图斯或布鲁姆，他的名字是，或者毕竟是其他任何名字，secundum carnem。

—Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.
——当然，B.先生接着规定，你必须看到问题的两面。他们说，很难就正确和错误制定任何硬性规定，但确实存在改进的空间，尽管每个国家，包括我们自己的苦难国家，都拥有应有的政府。但整体上都带有一点善意。互相夸耀都很好，但是互相平等呢？我憎恨任何形式的暴力和不宽容。它永远不会到达任何东西或停止任何东西。到期分期付款计划必须发生一场革命。从表面上看，憎恨人们是一种明显的荒谬，因为他们住在街角，说着另一种方言，可以说是在隔壁房子里。

—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.
——令人难忘的血腥桥战和七分钟的战争，史蒂芬同意，发生在斯金纳的小巷和奥蒙德市场之间。

Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.
是的，布卢姆先生完全同意，完全赞同这句话，这是绝对正确的。整个世界都充满了这样的事情。

—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely …
——你刚刚从我嘴里夺走了话，他说。坦率地说，你无法远程……相互矛盾的证据的错综复杂。

All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.
在他看来，所有那些令人不快的争吵，都是出于某种好斗情绪或某种腺体，错误地认为是关于荣誉和旗帜的问题，激起了不和，很大程度上是金钱问题。在一切贪婪和嫉妒的背后，人们永远不知道何时停止。

—They accuse, remarked he audibly.
——他们指责，他大声说道。

He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as the others in case they.
他转过身去，避开了其他可能说话更近的人，也避开了其他人，以防万一。

—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They are practical and are proved to be so. I don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks. It’s in the dogma. Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so I think. That’s the juggle on which the p.p’s raise the wind on false pretences. I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum. That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth. I call that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.
——他在斯蒂芬耳边轻声说道，犹太人被指责为破坏者。我可以肯定地说，其中没有任何真实的痕迹。你会惊讶地发现，历史证明，当宗教裁判所驱逐犹太人时，西班牙彻底衰落；而当克伦威尔（一个在其他方面需要承担很多责任的异常能干的恶棍）进口犹太人时，英格兰则繁荣起来。为什么？因为他们充满了正确的精神。它们是实用的并且被证明如此。我不想沉迷于任何一个，因为你知道标准在这个主题上有效，而且像你一样正统。但在经济领域，与宗教无关，牧师意味着贫穷。又是西班牙，你在战争中看到，与领先的美国相比。土耳其人。这是教条里的。因为如果他们不相信自己死后会直接去天堂，他们就会努力生活得更好，至少我是这么认为的。这就是人民党以虚假借口制造风声的把戏。他用戏剧性的力量继续说道，我是一个爱尔兰人，就像我一开始告诉你的那个粗鲁的人一样，我想见见每个人，他总结道，所有的信仰和阶层都按比例拥有舒适而整洁的收入，而不是小气鬼。时尚也好，每年300英镑左右。这是至关重要的问题，它是可行的，并且会激发人与人之间更友好的交往。至少这是我对它的价值的想法。我称之为爱国主义。 Ubi patria，正如我们在母校的经典日子里学到的一点点，vita bene。意义在于，如果你工作，你就能生活得很好。

Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.
斯蒂芬一边为一杯咖啡做出了难以品尝的道歉，一边听着这些事情的概要，没有盯着任何特别的东西。当然，他能听到各种变色的词语，就像早晨林森德周围的螃蟹快速地挖洞到不同种类的同一沙子的各种颜色中，它们在下面的某个地方有一个家，或者似乎在那里。然后他抬起头，看到那些眼睛说或不说他听到的声音说的话，如果你工作的话。

—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.
——别算我了，他设法说道，意思是工作。

The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.
这些眼睛对这一观察感到惊讶，因为作为他们的临时拥有者。观察到，或者更确切地说，他说话的声音确实如此，所有这些都必须共同努力，必须共同努力。

—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That’s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.
——我的意思是，当然，对方赶紧申明，在尽可能广泛的意义上工作。文学劳动也不仅仅是为了获得荣誉。为报纸撰稿，这是当今最便捷的渠道。这也是工作。重要的工作。毕竟，据我对你的了解，在你的教育上花费了所有的钱之后，你有权收回自己的钱并掌握你的价格。你和农民一样有权利靠笔谋生，追求自己的哲学。什么？你们都属于爱尔兰，无论是头脑还是体力。每一个都同样重要。

—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Ireland for short.
——你怀疑，斯蒂芬半笑着反驳道，我可能很重要，因为我属于圣帕特里斯郊区，简称爱尔兰。

—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.
——我会更进一步，布鲁姆先生暗示道。

—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.
——但我怀疑，斯蒂芬打断道，爱尔兰一定很重要，因为它属于我。

—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion. What was it you …?
——什么属于什么，布卢姆先生弯下腰问道，他猜想自己可能受到了某种误解。打扰一下。不幸的是，我没有听清后一部分。你那是什么……？

Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: 1170
史蒂芬显然脾气暴躁，重复了一遍，然后把他的咖啡杯推到一边，或者任何你喜欢称呼它的东西，不太礼貌地补充道：1170

—We can’t change the country. Let us change the subject.
——我们无法改变这个国家。让我们换个话题吧。

At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.
听到这个中肯的建议，布卢姆先生改变了话题，低下头，但陷入了困境，因为他无法准确说出要建造的建筑属于哪个听起来相去甚远的建筑。某种责备比其他部分更清楚。不用说，他最近狂欢的烟雾带着某种粗暴的语气，以一种奇怪的苦涩的方式与他的清醒状态格格不入。也许B先生最重视的家庭生活并没有满足他所需要的，或者他没有熟悉合适的人。他对身边的年轻人感到一丝恐惧，他带着某种惊愕的神情偷偷地打量着他，想起自己刚从巴黎回来，那双眼睛尤其让他想起了父亲和妹妹，却没有对这个问题有太多的了解。然而，他让我想起了一些有教养的人的例子，他们的承诺如此辉煌，却被扼杀在过早腐烂的萌芽状态，除了他们自己，没有人能责怪他们。例如，奥卡拉汉就是一个例子，他是一个半疯狂的时尚主义者，尽管手段不足，但与他的疯狂变幻莫测有关，在他的其他同性恋行为中，他习惯于让自己成为周围每个人的麻烦。在公共场合炫耀一套牛皮纸套装（事实）。然后，在乐趣快速而激烈地进行之后，他让 1190 落入热水中，在下城堡场的约翰·马伦 (John Mallon) 强烈暗示了一匹盲目的马后，不得不被几个朋友偷偷带走，所以不符合《刑法修正案》第二条的规定，被传唤者的某些姓名被提交但不予透露，原因任何有头脑的人都会想到。 简而言之，把两个和两个放在一起，六十六，他故意充耳不闻，安东尼奥等等，骑师和美学家以及纹身，这在七十年代左右甚至在上议院都是流行的，因为早年王位的占有者、当时的法定继承人、其他十位上层成员和其他高级人物只是追随国家元首的脚步，他反思了恶名昭彰、加冕元首违背道德的错误，例如几年前，康沃尔郡的案件在他们的外表下以一种几乎不符合自然的方式，这是一件好事，按照法律规定，格伦迪夫人非常沮丧，尽管不是因为他们认为自己可能是什么，除了主要是女性之外我们总是或多或少地互相摆弄，这主要是着装问题以及其他所有问题。喜欢独特内衣的女士应该，每个剪裁考究的男人都必须，试图通过暗示来拉大他们之间的差距，并为两人之间的不当行为提供更多真诚的讽刺，她解开他的纽扣，然后他解开她的纽扣，注意别针，而食人群岛的野蛮人，比如说，在九十度的阴影下，不关心大陆。然而，回归到最初，也有一些人，是靠着自己的努力，从最底层，一路爬到了顶峰。纯粹的天赋力量，那。有脑子，先生。

For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column. My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman’s Shelter.
出于这个原因和进一步的原因，他觉得等待并从意想不到的机会中获利也是他的兴趣和责任，尽管他不能确切地告诉他为什么，因为事实上已经让自己陷入了困境，坏事已经是几先令了。不过，结识一些能力不凡、能为反思提供食物的人，对任何小事都会有很大的回报。他觉得，智力刺激有时是心灵的一流补品。除此之外，还有会议、讨论、舞蹈、争吵、今天在这里、明天消失类型的老盐、夜间懒汉鞋，整个事件的银河系的巧合，所有这些都构成了我们生活的世界的一个微型客串作为被淹没的第十个人的生命，即。煤矿工人、潜水员、拾荒者等最近都受到密切关注。为了改善这个闪亮的时刻，他想知道如果他以一基尼的速度写下一些不寻常的东西（正如他完全打算做的那样），如果以书面形式记录下来，他是否会遇到与菲利普·博福伊先生相同的运气。每列。比方说，我在马车夫避难所的经历。

The pink edition extra sporting of the Telegraph tell a graphic lie lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed A. Boudin find the captain’s age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province the allembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle, Tokio. Lovemaking in Irish, 200 pounds damages. Gordon Bennett. Emigration Swindle. Letter from His Grace. William . Ascot meeting, the Gold Cup. Victory of outsider Throwaway recalls Derby of ‘92 when Capt. Marshall’s dark horse Sir Hugo captured the blue ribband at long odds. New York disaster. Thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth.

幸运的是，《每日电讯报》的粉色版额外体育版讲述了一个生动的谎言，幸运的是，就在他的肘部旁边，当他再次对属于他的国家感到困惑时，远远不满意，而前面的谜题是这艘船来自布里奇沃特明信片上的地址是A.布丹，他找到了船长的年龄，他的眼睛漫无目的地扫过各自的标题，这些标题属于他的特殊省份，包罗万象，今天给我们提供了每日新闻。一开始他有一点开头，但后来发现这只是关于一个名叫 H. 杜博耶斯的人的事，他是打字机代理人或类似的人。伟大的战斗，东京。用爱尔兰语做爱，赔偿 200 英镑。戈登·贝内特。移民诈骗。陛下的来信。威廉 。阿斯科特赛会，金杯赛。局外人 Throwaway 的胜利让人回想起 92 年的德比，当时马歇尔上尉的黑马雨果爵士以微弱优势夺得了蓝丝带。纽约灾难。数千人丧生。脚和嘴。已故帕特里克·迪格纳姆先生的葬礼。

So to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address anyway.
因此，为了改变话题，他读到了关于迪格纳姆·安息吧（Dignam R.I.P.）的文章，他反思道，这绝不是一次同性恋送别。或者换个地址也行。

—This morning (Hynes put it in of course) the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) by Messrs H. J. O’Neill and Son, 164 North Strand Road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (brother-in-law), Jno. Henry Menton, solr, Martin Cunningham, John Power, .)eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes’s ad) Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus B. ,4., Edw. J. Lambert, Cornelius T. Kelleher, Joseph M’C Hynes, L. Boom, CP M’Coy,—M’lntosh and several others.
——今天早上（当然是海因斯说的）已故帕特里克·迪格纳姆先生的遗体被从他位于桑迪蒙特纽布里奇大道 9 号的住所移走，安葬在格拉斯内文。这位已故的先生是城市生活中最受欢迎、最和蔼可亲的人物，他因病短暂去世，给各阶层市民带来了极大的震撼，并深感遗憾。葬礼由北岸路 164 号 H. J. 奥尼尔父子主持，死者的许多朋友都出席了葬礼（当然，海因斯是在科尼的推动下写的）。哀悼者包括：帕特克。迪格纳姆 (儿子)、伯纳德·科里根 (姐夫)、Jno。 Henry Menton，solr，Martin Cunningham，John Power，.)eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora（一定是他在凯斯的广告中称蒙克斯为日父）Thomas Kernan，Simon Dedalus，Stephen Dedalus B.，4.，Edw。 J. Lambert、Cornelius T. Kelleher、Joseph M’C Hynes、L. Boom、CP M’Coy、M’lntosh 等。

Nettled not a little by L. Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M’Coy and Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of M’Intosh) L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.
L. Boom（正如它错误地表述的那样）和那条恶毒的类型让我很恼火，但同时也被 C. P. M'Coy 和 Stephen Dedalus B. A. 逗乐了，不用说，他们完全缺席（更不用说，他们很引人注目） L. Boom 向他的同伴 B. A. 指出了这一点，B. A. 正强忍住又一个哈欠，半是紧张，同时也没有忘记通常会因印刷错误而发出的无意义的咆哮。

—Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.
——这是写给希伯来人的第一封书信吗？当他的下颌允许他进入时，他问道？文本：张开你的嘴，把你的脚放进去。

—It is. Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford’s after all managing to. There.
-这是。确实，布卢姆先生说（尽管一开始他以为自己是在暗指大主教，直到他加上了脚和嘴，而这两者之间不可能有任何联系），他非常高兴地让自己的心平静了下来，而且在终于做到了之后，对迈尔斯·克劳福德的事感到有些惊讶。那里。

While the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his side. Value 1000 sovs with 3000 sovs in specie added. For entire colts and fillies. Mr F. Alexander’s Throwaway, b. h. by Rightaway, 5 yrs, 9 st 4 lbs (W. Lane) 1, lord Howard de Walden’s Zinfandel (M. Cannon) z, Mr W. Bass’s Sceptre 3. Betting 5 to 4 on Zinfandel, 20 to 1 Throwaway (off). Sceptre a shade heavier, 5 to 4 on Zinfandel, 20 to 1 Throwaway (off). Throwaway and Zinfandel stood close order. It was anybody’s race then the rank outsider drew to the fore, got long lead, beating lord Howard de Walden’s chestnut colt and Mr W. Bass’s bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. Winner trained by Braime so that Lenehan’s version of the business was all pure buncombe. Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. 1000 sovs with 3000 in specie. Also ran: J de Bremond’s (French horse Bantam Lyons was anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute) Maximum II. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn’t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.
当另一个人在读第二页时，布姆（暂时给他一个新的用词不当的地方）断断续续地消磨了一些奇怪的休闲时刻，并从第三页上他一方在阿斯科特举行的第三场比赛的报道开始。价值 1000 苏维，并添加 3000 苏维。适用于整匹小马和母马。 F.亚历山大先生的一次性物品，b。 H。 by Rightaway，5 yrs，9 st 4 lbs (W. Lane) 1，霍华德·德瓦尔登勋爵的仙粉黛 (M. Cannon) z，W. Bass 先生的权杖 3. 在仙粉黛上投注 5 比 4，20 比 1 Throwaway（关闭） 。 Scepter 颜色较重，仙粉黛为 5 比 4，Throwaway 为 20 比 1（关闭）。 Throwaway 和 Zinfandel 的位置很接近。这是任何人的比赛，然后排名局外的人脱颖而出，取得了很大的领先优势，在 2 1/2 英里的赛道上击败了霍华德·德瓦尔登勋爵的栗色小马驹和 W.巴斯先生的海湾母马权杖。获胜者经过布雷姆（Braime）的培训，因此莱内汉（Lenehan）的业务版本完全是纯粹的笨蛋。巧妙地确保了判决的长度。 1000 个 sov，其中 3000 个实物。还参加了：J de Bremond 的（法国马 Bantam Lyons 尚未参加但预计随时会出现）Maximum II，正在焦急地询问。发动政变的不同方式。做爱伤害。尽管那个半生不熟的莱昂斯在他的冲动中跑出了切线，想要离开。当然，赌博非常适合这种事情，尽管事实证明这个可怜的傻瓜没有太多理由祝贺自己的选择，即绝望的希望。最终它自己变成了猜测。

—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.
——一切迹象表明他们会达到这一目标，他，布鲁姆，说。

—Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.
-WHO？另一个手受伤了的人说道。

One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: Return of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn’t. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.
有一天早上，你会打开报纸，马车夫确认道，上面写着：帕内尔归来。他跟他们打赌，他们喜欢什么就打什么。一天晚上，一名都柏林燧发枪手在那个避难所里，说他在南非看到了他。骄傲被杀了。他应该自杀，或者在15号委员会会议室之后低调一段时间，直到他再次恢复原来的样子，没有人对他指手画脚。然后，他们会希望有一个人已经把他们的骨髓都埋在他身边，等他恢复知觉后才回来。他没有死。简直是潜逃到某个地方了。他们抬过来的棺材里装满了石头。他改名为德韦特，布尔将军。他在与牧师的战斗中犯了一个错误。等等等等。

All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in the title rôle how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, Bella was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: Excuse me, my name is So and So or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.
尽管如此，布卢姆（正确地这样称呼）对他们的记忆感到相当惊讶，因为十分之九的情况都是柏油桶的情况，而且不是单独的而是成千上万的，然后完全被遗忘，因为已经有二十多年了。当然，石头中甚至有一丝真实的影子也是极不可能的，即使假设，考虑到所有因素，他也认为返回是非常不可取的。他的死显然激怒了他们。要么是当他的各种不同的政治安排即将完成时，他的急性肺炎逐渐消失，要么是他的死亡归咎于他在感冒时尿湿后没有及时咨询医生而导致他的死亡。他被限制在自己的房间里，直到两周结束前，他在广泛的遗憾中去世，或者很可能他们因发现工作从他们手中被夺走而感到痛苦。当然，甚至在他开始使用福克斯和斯图尔特等几个化名之前，就没有人知道他的行踪，也完全不知道他的行踪，这显然是爱丽丝的，你在哪里命令的，所以发出的评论从朋友出租车司机那里来的可能是有可能的。自然地，这会掠夺他作为天生的男人领袖的思想，毫无疑问，他是一个指挥人物，一个六英尺高的人，或者至少是五英尺十或十一英尺的长袜，而某先生和某先生，尽管他们不是“与前一个男人相比，甚至没有任何差距，在他们的救赎特征非常少且相距甚远之后，他们就占据了统治地位。这无疑是一个寓意，这个偶像是泥足的，然后他的七十二个值得信赖的追随者围攻他，互相诽谤。 杀人犯也是如此。你必须回来。那种令人难以忘怀的感觉有点吸引你。向标题中的替补角色展示如何做。他在一个吉祥的场合见过他一次，当时他们在不可抑制的类型中解散了，或者是联合爱尔兰，这是他非常感激的一种特权，事实上，当他的丝质帽子被打掉时，他把它递给了他，他说了声谢谢。你，尽管他在冰冷的外表下无疑是兴奋的，尽管杯子和嘴唇之间提到了小小的不幸：骨中孕育的东西。还是关于回归。如果你一回来他们就没有把猎犬放在你身上，你就是一只幸运的狗。接下来通常会出现很多犹豫不决的情况，汤姆支持，迪克和哈利反对。然后，第一，你遇到了拥有者，必须出示你的凭证，就像蒂奇伯恩案中的原告罗杰·查尔斯·蒂奇伯恩一样，贝拉是他所记得的船的名字，他作为继承人，沉没了证据显示，还有一个用印度墨水写的纹身标记，就是贝卢勋爵，因为他可能很容易从船上的某个朋友那里得到了细节，然后，当起身与描述相符时自我介绍时可以这样说：对不起，我叫某某，或者类似这样的老生常谈的话。正如布卢姆对那些不太热情的人所说的那样，更谨慎的做法是先揭穿这片土地的谎言，事实上就像他旁边正在讨论的杰出人物一样。

—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.
——那个贱人，那个英国妓女，为他做的，女主人评论道。她在他的棺材上钉下了第一颗钉子。

—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the soi-disant townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man’s thighs. I seen her picture in a barber’s. The husband was a captain or an officer.
——尽管如此，她还是个不错的女人，远离街道的镇书记亨利·坎贝尔评论道，而且她很出色。她松开了许多男人的大腿。我在理发店看到过她的照片。丈夫是一名上尉或军官。

—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.
——哎呀，剥山羊皮有趣地补充道，他就是一个棉球。

This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the l8th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.
这位幽默人物的无偿贡献在他的随从中引起了一阵阵笑声。至于布卢姆，他没有丝毫怀疑地微笑，只是凝视着门的方向，思考着当时引起人们极大兴趣的历史故事，更糟糕的是，事实以通常的方式公之于众。他们之间传递的深情信件充满了甜蜜的事情。首先，这完全是柏拉图式的，直到自然介入，他们之间产生了一种依恋，直到事情一点一点地达到高潮，这件事成为镇上的话题，直到令人震惊的打击作为一个受欢迎的情报，对不少邪恶的人来说，然而，他们决心阻止他的垮台，尽管这件事一直是公共财产，尽管没有达到后来发展到的轰动程度。不过，既然他们的名字是连在一起的，既然他是她最喜欢的人，那么有必要在屋顶上向普通民众宣布这一事实，即他曾与她共用卧室，这一点在证人席上就已经出来了。宣誓仪式上，挤满了人的法庭里充满了激动，目击者们发誓亲眼目睹了他在某个特定的日子里穿着睡衣借助梯子从楼上的公寓里爬出来，以同样的方式获得准入，事实是周刊，有点沉迷于润滑油，只是从中赚了一大笔钱。 然而这个案件的简单事实是，这只是一个丈夫不合格的案件，他们之间除了名字之外没有任何共同点，然后一个真正的男人出现了，坚强到虚弱的边缘，成为她海妖魅力的受害者，忘记家庭纽带，这是通常的后果，沐浴在所爱之人的微笑中。不用说，夫妻生活这个永恒的问题突然出现了。假设案件中碰巧有另一个人，真正的爱情可以存在于已婚人士之间吗？装腔作势。尽管他是否满怀爱意、被一波愚蠢冲昏了头脑，这绝对与他们无关。与其他军事编外人员相比，他确实是一个雄伟的男子气概典范，明显地通过高级天赋而得到增强（他们只是平常的日常告别，我勇敢的上尉是轻龙骑兵中的一个人，第十八骠骑兵团）准确地说）并且毫无疑问是易燃的（倒下的领导人，也就是说，不是另一个）以他自己独特的方式，当然，她，女人，很快就认为他很有可能开辟他的成名之路，他几乎公平地这样做，直到整个福音的牧师和传道人，他昔日的坚定追随者，以及他心爱的被驱逐的佃户，他在该国的农村地区为他们提供了自耕农服务，以一种超越他们最常的方式代表他们拿起棍棒。乐观的期望，非常有效地煮熟了他的婚姻鹅，从而在他的头上堆起了炭火，就像传说中的驴子踢一样。现在回想起来，一切都像是一场梦。 然后回来是你做过的最糟糕的事情，因为不用说你会感到格格不入，因为事情总是随着时间而变化。正如他所反映的，为什么爱尔兰镇海岸这个他已经很多年没有去过的地方看起来有些不同，因为碰巧他搬到了北边居住。然而，无论是北方还是南方，这只是众所周知的热烈激情的例子，纯粹而简单，以复仇的方式扰乱了苹果车，并且恰好证实了他所说的，因为她也是西班牙人或一半西班牙人，那种类型的人不会做事半途而废，对南方的热情抛弃，把一切正派都抛到九霄云外。

—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.
——这正好证实了我所说的，他怀着炽热的胸膛对斯蒂芬说，关于血和太阳。而且，如果我没记错的话，她也是西班牙人。

—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.
——西班牙国王的女儿斯蒂芬回答道，并添加了一些相当混乱的内容，关于向你们告别和告别，西班牙洋葱和第一块叫做“亡灵”的土地，从拉姆黑德到锡利有那么多很多。

—Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there. So, Spain.
——是她吗？布鲁姆脱口​​而出，虽然并不感到惊讶，但我还是很惊讶，我以前从没听说过这个谣言。有可能，尤其是在那里，因为她住在那里。那么，西班牙。

Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him by the by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.
小心翼翼地避开口袋里的一本书《糖果》，这让他想起了Capl街图书馆那本过时的书，他掏出钱包，飞快地翻阅着里面的各种内容。

—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?
——顺便说一句，他若有所思地挑选了放在桌子上的一张褪色的照片，说道，你认为这是西班牙风格吗？

Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was In Old Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.
斯蒂芬显然是在讲话，他俯视着一张照片，照片上是一位身材魁梧的女士，她的肉欲魅力以一种开放的方式显现出来，她穿着低胸晚礼服，正处于女性气质的盛开状态，以便在这个场合自由地展示胸部。不仅仅是乳房的视野，她丰满的嘴唇张开，还有一些完美的牙齿，站在一架钢琴附近，表面上看起来很重力，其余的都是在旧马德里，一首民谣，以它的方式美丽，这是当时所有的时尚。她（这位女士）的眼睛又黑又大，看着史蒂芬，正要微笑着谈论一些令人钦佩的事情，威斯特摩兰街的拉斐特，都柏林首席摄影艺术家，负责美学执行。

—Mrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like her then.
——布卢姆夫人，我的妻子，首席夫人马里昂·特威迪女士，布卢姆表示。几年后拍摄的。大约在九十六岁左右。很喜欢那时的她。

Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 1440 legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it does though Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.
在年轻人旁边，他还看了那位女士的照片，这位女士现在是他 1440 年的合法妻子，他暗示说，这位女士是布莱恩·特威迪少校多才多艺的女儿，从小就表现出了非凡的歌手才华，甚至向公众鞠躬。那时她的年岁才刚刚满十六岁。至于脸，在表情上确实很相似，但它并没有正确地体现出她的身材，她的身材通常会引起很多注意，而且在这种装扮中并没有发挥出最好的优势。他说，她可以毫不费力地为整体摆出姿势，而不是沉迷于某些华丽的曲线。作为一名业余时间的艺术家，他从总体上关注女性形态的发展，因为碰巧，就在那天下午，他在 1450 年看到了那些希腊雕像，这些雕像完美地发展为艺术品。国家博物馆。大理石可以呈现出原来的样子，肩膀，背部，所有的对称性，所有其他的。是的，清教徒主义，尽管圣约瑟夫的主权盗窃行为（班德斯！）Figne toi trop 确实如此。然而没有照片可以，因为它根本不是艺术。

The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.
他的精神感动了他，他很想效仿杰克·塔尔的好榜样，将相似之处留在那里几分钟，以求自己说话，以便对方可以为自己陶醉在美丽中，她的舞台表现是，坦率地说，这种享受本身是相机根本无法公正地呈现的。但这根本不是职业礼仪。虽然这是一个温暖宜人的夜晚，但考虑到这个季节，暴风雨过后的阳光，却非常凉爽。他确实感觉到了一种需要，就像一种内心的声音，然后通过移动动作来满足可能的需要。尽管如此，他还是坐在那儿，只是看着那张被华丽曲线弄皱的略显脏污的照片，尽管磨损并没有变得更糟，但他若有所思地把目光移开，目的是在衡量她起伏的埋点对称性时，不进一步增加对方可能的尴尬。事实上，轻微的脏污只是一种额外的魅力，就像亚麻布轻微脏污的情况一样，完好如新，事实上，去掉淀粉后好多了。假设他离开时她已经走了呢？我寻找着她告诉我的那盏灯，这盏灯出现在他的脑海里，但这只是他的一闪而过的幻想，因为他随后想起了早上乱七八糟的床等等，还有一本关于鲁比的书，里面有他的长矛软管（原文如此），它一定是掉下来了。非常恰当地放在家用尿壶旁边，向林德利·穆雷表示歉意。

The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingué and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.
他当然很喜欢这个年轻人，他受过良好的教育，很出众，而且很冲动，他无疑是这群人中的佼佼者，尽管你不认为他有这种能力，但你会的。此外，他还说这张照片很漂亮，不管你怎么说，但此刻她明显更胖了。那么为何不？关于这类事情，有很多虚构的内容，涉及终生的诽谤，通常是关于同样的旧婚姻纠纷的醒目新闻，指控职业高尔夫球手或最新的舞台上的不当行为，而不是诚实和光明正大地对待整个事情。他们是如何命中注定的相遇，以及两人之间产生了怎样的依恋，以至于他们的名字在公众的视野中结合在一起，法庭上的信件都充满了惯常的糊涂和妥协的表情，没有留下任何漏洞表明他们公开同居过两三次。在某个著名的海滨酒店度过了一周，当事情进展正常时，关系就在适当的时候变得亲密起来。然后，尼西法令和国王的监察员试图说明原因，但他未能废除它，尼西被定为绝对的。但至于这两起轻罪，因为他们基本上是彼此纠缠在一起的，所以可以放心地忽视它，就像他们在很大程度上所做的那样，直到此事交给一名律师，该律师为受害方提出了一份请愿书。课程。 当事件发生在历史性的骚乱中时，他，B，享受着与艾琳的无冕之王的肉身亲密接触的殊荣，当时倒下的领导人，众所周知，即使披着通奸的外衣，他也坚持自己的枪到最后一滴，（领导人的）可信赖的追随者，数量有十个或十几个，甚至可能更多，渗透到不可抑制的印刷厂，或者不，它是联合爱尔兰（绝不是一个适当的称谓），并用锤子打破了打字机或者类似的事情，都是因为奥布赖恩派抄写员在通常的诽谤职业中，从他们的灵巧的笔中流出了一些下流的内容，反映了昔日论坛的私人道德。虽然明显是一个彻底改变的人，但他仍然是一个居高临下的人物，尽管像往常一样不小心装扮成坚定的目标，这对那些犹豫不决的人来说很长一段时间，直到他们发现他们的偶像在把他放在一个石头上之后，他们的偶像有一个泥足。然而她是第一个察觉到的基座。当时正是喧闹的时候，布鲁姆受到了人群中某个家伙的肘部的严重刺激，受了轻伤，这些人当然聚集在胃部附近的某个地方，幸运的是，伤势并不严重。 他的帽子（帕内尔的）是一顶丝绸帽子，不经意间被打落了，从严格的历史来看，布鲁姆是在目睹这一事件后在拥挤中捡起这顶帽子的人，他打算把它还给他（他确实把它还给了他）极其迅速）他气喘吁吁，没戴帽子，当时的思绪离他的帽子有几英里远，尽管如此，他是一位生来就与这个国家有利害关系的绅士，事实上，他更多地是为了荣誉而进入这个国家。最重要的是，在他婴儿时期，在他母亲的膝盖上，骨头里孕育的东西就以知道什么是好的形式的形式灌输给了他，因为他转身向捐赠者，泰然自若地感谢他，说道：谢谢你，先生，尽管语气与法律职业的装饰截然不同，他们的头饰布鲁姆也在当天早些时候恢复了正常，历史以不同的方式重演，在埋葬了一位共同的朋友之后在完成了将他的遗体送入坟墓的艰巨任务之后，他们把他独自留在了荣耀之中。

On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing 1530 immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.
另一方面，更让他内心恼火的是马车夫等人的明目张胆的笑话，他们把这一切当作笑话，肆无忌惮地大笑1530，假装明白一切，知道为什么和为什么，实际上不知道自己的情况。头脑中，这对双方本身来说是一个案件，除非由于普通男孩琼斯的一封匿名信而导致合法丈夫碰巧成为其中一方，琼斯碰巧在关键时刻以爱的姿态遇到了他们她们互相搂抱在一起，引起人们对他们非法行为的关注，导致一场家庭骚乱，犯错的美人跪下乞求她的主人和主人的宽恕，并承诺切断联系，不再接受他的拜访，只要受委屈的丈夫会忽略这件事，让过去的事过去，眼里含着泪水，尽管可能同时用舌头舔着她白皙的脸颊，很可能还有其他几个人。他个人，出于怀疑的偏见，相信并且毫不犹豫地说，男人或男人的复数总是在等待一位女士的名单上徘徊，即使假设她是世界上最好的妻子。他们为了争论而相处得很好，当她忽视自己的职责，选择厌倦婚姻生活，并用礼貌的放荡来一点点颤抖，以不正当的意图将他们的注意力吸引到她身上时，结果由于她的感情集中在另一个人身上，这是许多仍然有吸引力的已婚女性与四十岁或更年轻的白皙男性发生关系的原因，毫无疑问，几个著名的女性迷恋案例证明了这一点。

It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.
一个年轻人，像他的邻居一样拥有足够的头脑，却把宝贵的时间浪费在挥霍的女人身上，这真是一千件遗憾，这些女人可能会为他提供一剂好药，让他终生受益。出于单身幸福的本质，有一天，当理想小姐出现时，他会为自己娶一个妻子，但在临时的女士交往中，这是一个必要条件，尽管他有最严重的怀疑，而不是他想要在最小的让史蒂芬想起弗格森小姐（她很可能就是这么一大早把他带到爱尔兰镇的那个北极星），以及他是否会在男孩和女孩求爱的想法以及傻笑错过的陪伴中感到满足。每两周或三周给他们的名字加一分钱，以正统的初步恭维慢跑，玩耍和散步，通向心爱的恋人的道路，鲜花和巧克力。想到他有房子，无家可归，被某个比继母还要糟糕的女房东欺负，对他这个年纪来说真是太糟糕了。他突然冒出的奇怪东西吸引了年长的男人，他比对方大几岁，或者像他父亲一样，但他当然应该吃一些实质性的东西，即使只是用纯母性营养制成的鸡蛋饼，或者，做不到这一点，朴素的矮个子矮胖煮熟了。

—At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.
——你几点吃饭？他对那苗条的身材和虽然没有皱纹但疲惫不堪的脸提出了质疑。

—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.
——昨天的某个时候，斯蒂芬说。

—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!
-昨天！布卢姆惊呼道，直到他记起已经是明天星期五了。啊，你的意思是十二点以后了！

—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.
——前天，史蒂芬一边说，一边自我提升。

Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.
布鲁姆所反映的这一情报让我感到震惊。尽管他们在所有事情上都没有达成某种类比，但不知怎的，他们的思想似乎都在同一个思路中旅行。大约几十年前，在他涉足政治的年龄，当他在巴克肖特福斯特时代几乎渴望获得议会荣誉时，他也回忆道（这本身就是一种强烈的满足感），他偷偷地尊重那些同样的极端想法。 例如，当被驱逐的租户的问题一开始就在人们的脑海中占据了很大一部分时，不言而喻，他没有捐出一分钱，也没有完全相信其格言，其中一些格言并不完全站得住脚，他无论如何，他从一开始就原则上完全同情农民占有，认为它表达了现代观点的趋势（然而，这种偏袒，在意识到自己的错误后，后来得到了部分纠正），甚至被嘲笑为更进一步。迈克尔·戴维特在一次作为回国者反复灌输的引人注目的观点方面比迈克尔·戴维特更出色，这也是他强烈反对我们的朋友在巴尼·基尔南的部落聚会上如此赤裸裸地对他进行暗示的原因之一，因此他虽然经常受到相当大的误解，而且最不好斗的凡人，重复一遍，背离了他的习惯习惯，给他（比喻性的）一个砂囊，不过，就政治本身而言，他太清楚由于政治原因而不可避免地造成的伤亡。相互敌意的宣传和展示，以及由此给优秀年轻人带来的痛苦和苦难，主要是适者生存，简而言之。

Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.
不管怎样，在权衡利弊之后，就这么决定了，现在是晚上睡觉的时候了。关键是把他带回家有点冒险，因为可能会发生不测事件（有时有人会发脾气），并完全破坏哈希值，就像那天晚上他错误地带回家一只爪子跛了的狗（品种未知）一样（并不是说这些案件要么是相同的，要么是相反的，尽管他的手也受伤了）到安大略台，因为他清楚地记得，可以说，曾经去过那里。另一方面，对于桑迪蒙特或桑迪科夫的建议来说，这已经太迟了，因此他对这两个选择中的哪一个感到有些困惑。一切都表明，从各方面考虑，他都应该充分利用这个机会。他最初的印象是他有点冷漠，或者不太热情，但不知何故，这种感觉越来越强烈。一方面，如果有人接近，他可能不会像你所说的那样欣然接受这个想法，而最让他担心的是，如果他确实接受了这个提议，他不知道如何实现这个想法，也不知道如何准确地表达出来。如果他允许他帮忙放一些硬币或一些衣柜（如果合适的话），这会给他带来很大的个人乐趣。不管怎样，他最后的结论是，避开了那种墨守成规的先例，喝了一杯埃普斯的可可，睡了一晚，再加上一两张地毯和大衣，叠在枕头里，至少他会安全地得到照顾，就像三脚架上的烤面包一样温暖，他没有意识到任何非常大的伤害，因为总是有条件没有引起任何形式的喧闹。 必须采取行动，因为那个快乐的老灵魂，那个似乎被粘在原地的鳏夫，似乎并没有特别匆忙地回家，回到他心爱的皇后镇，而且很可能是某个海绵者的家。退休美女的妓院，年龄不受警长街下限的限制，将是了解那个模棱两可的人物在未来几天的行踪的最佳线索，交替地用六室左轮手枪的轶事来折磨他们的感情（美人鱼的），这些轶事几乎是热带的，注定要冻结任何人骨头的骨髓，并在大剂量的potheen和通常的关于他自己的真实身份的伴奏下，以粗暴和翻滚的热情敲打他们巨大的魅力，让x等于我的正确名字和地址，就像代数先生一样评论 帕西姆。与此同时，他对鲜血与金钱冠军温和地回答说他的神是犹太人，心里咯咯地笑起来。人们可以忍受被狼咬，但真正激怒他们的是被羊咬。最脆弱的地方也是温柔的跟腱。你的神是犹太人。因为他们大多认为他来自香农河畔卡里克或斯莱戈县的某个地方。

—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. You can’t drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I’ll just pay this lot.
——我提议，我们的英雄经过成熟的思考后最终建议，同时小心翼翼地把自己的照片装进口袋，因为这里很闷，你就跟我回家谈谈吧。我的矿区就在附近。你不能喝那个东西。你喜欢可可吗？等待。我就付这么多钱。

The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.
最好的计划显然是离开，剩下的事情就一帆风顺了，他一边小心翼翼地把照片装进口袋，一边向棚屋的管理员招手，但他似乎并没有这样做。

—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.
——是的，那是最好的，他向史蒂芬保证，对于那个黄铜头或他或其他任何地方的事情或多或少都是对史蒂芬来说的。

All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.
各种各样的乌托邦计划在他（B）忙碌的大脑中闪过，教育（真正的文章），文学，新闻，奖品花絮，最新的账单，在充满水疗和海滨剧院的英国水上胜地举行音乐会巡回演出，把钱转走，用意大利语二重唱，口音完全真实，还有一些其他东西，当然，没有必要在屋顶上告诉世界和他的妻子这件事，还有一点运气。所需要的就是一个空缺。因为他非常怀疑自己有父亲的声音来寄托他的希望，而这完全是他所拥有的，所以顺便说一句，将谈话引向那个特定的红鲱鱼的方向也无妨。只为了。

The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.
出租车司机从他拿到的报纸上读到，前总督卡多根伯爵曾在伦敦某处主持过出租车司机协会的晚宴。伴随着这一激动人心的消息的是一片寂静，还夹杂着一两个哈欠。然后，角落里似乎还残留着一些活力的老标本读出了安东尼·麦克唐纳爵士已经离开尤斯顿前往首席秘书的住所的消息，或者类似的话。这篇引人入胜的情报回应了原因。

—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.
——祖父，这位古代水手所写的文献，让我们看一下，表现出一些自然的不耐烦。

—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.
——欢迎，老年党如此说道。

The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.
水手从箱子里拿出一副绿色的护目镜，他慢慢地把它挂在鼻子和双耳上。

—Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.
——你眼睛不好吗？城镇职员等同情人士问道。

—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. The Arabian Nights Entertainment was my favourite and Red as a Rose is She.
——为什么，留着格子呢胡子的海员回答道，他似乎以自己的方式有点文学海湾，从海绿色的舷窗向外凝视，正如你可能会描述的那样，我用护目镜阅读。红海的沙子做到了这一点。有一次我可以在黑暗中看书，用说话的方式来说。 《天方夜谭》是我的最爱，《红如玫瑰》是她。

Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.
于是，他把日记本打开，仔细研究天知道是什么，发现淹死了，或者是柳树国王的功绩，伊雷蒙格为诺茨队制造了一百多第二个三柱门，在此期间（完全不顾伊雷），守门员非常紧张他正忙着松开一只显然是新的或二手的靴子，这明显压住了他，同时他嘀咕着无论卖给谁，所有这些人都足够清醒，可以通过他们的面部表情认出来，也就是说，要么只是闷闷不乐地看着，要么是顺便说一句琐碎的话。

To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.
长话短说，布鲁姆掌握了局势，第一个从座位上站起来，以免超出他们的欢迎范围，首先，最重要的是，他兑现了他将为此事件买单的诺言，接受了明智的预防措施是，当其他人没有注意到应付款即将到来时，他会不引人注目地向我的主人示意，作为告别射击，这几乎是一个难以察觉的信号，总共四便士（他不引人注目地存入四个铜币的金额，实际上是最后一个莫希干人），他之前在所有跑到他对面阅读的人的印刷价目表上发现了明确无误的数字，咖啡 2d，糖果确实如此，而且老实说，正如韦瑟鲁普曾经说过的那样，在某种程度上，它们的价值是两倍。

—Come, he counselled to close the séance.
——来吧，他建议结束降神会。

Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.
看到诡计奏效，海岸已畅通无阻，他们一起离开了避难所或棚屋，以及油布和同伴的精英社会，除了地震之外，没有什么可以让他们摆脱他们的甜蜜远方。斯蒂芬承认仍然感觉不舒服，疲惫不堪，他在门口停了一会儿。

—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafes. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:
——有一件事我一直不明白，他说这是一时兴起的原创。为什么他们晚上把桌子倒过来，我的意思是把椅子倒过来，放在咖啡馆的桌子上。对此，永不言败的布鲁姆毫不犹豫地即兴回答道：

—To sweep the floor in the morning.
——早上去扫地。

So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.
说着，他跳来跳去，灵活地考虑着，同时坦率地为站在同伴的右侧而感到抱歉，这是他的习惯，顺便说一句，他的右侧，用古典习语来说，就是他温柔的阿喀琉斯。尽管斯蒂芬的脚有点虚弱，但夜晚的空气确实是一种呼吸的享受。

—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. Come. It’s not far. Lean on me.
——（空气）对你有好处，布卢姆说，指的是一会儿散步。唯一的办法就是走路，然后你就会感觉到一个不同的人。来。不是很远。靠在我身上。

Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly.
因此，他将左臂放在斯蒂芬的右手上，并带领他继续前行。

—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.
——是的，史蒂芬不确定地说，因为他觉得自己感觉到了一个不同人的奇怪的肉体正在接近他，没有肌肉，摇摇晃晃等等。

Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.
无论如何，他们经过了放着石头、火盆等的哨兵岗亭，那里的市政编外人员，前古姆利，仍然像谚语所说的那样，全身心地投入墨菲的怀抱中，梦想着新鲜的田野和新的牧场。至于石头棺材，这个类比一点也不坏，因为事实上，分裂时八十多个选区中的七十二人被乱石砸死，主要是受人称赞的农民阶级，可能是同一个人。驱逐了他安置​​在他们土地上的租户。

So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s Huguenots, Meyerbeer’s Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart’s Twelfth Mass he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel’s air in Martha, M’appari, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.
于是他们开始谈论音乐，这是一种艺术形式，作为一个纯粹的业余爱好者，当他们手挽着手在贝雷斯福德广场上创作曲目时，布鲁姆对这种艺术形式有着极大的热爱。瓦格纳的音乐虽然在其方式上无可否认是伟大的，但对布鲁姆来说有点太重了，在第一次演奏时很难跟上，但他只是陶醉于梅尔卡丹特的胡格诺派、迈耶贝尔的《十字架上的最后七句话》和莫扎特的《第十二弥撒》的音乐，在他看来，格洛丽亚就是一流音乐的巅峰，简直把其他一切都打倒了。他非常喜欢天主教堂的神圣音乐，胜过对面商店能提供的任何类似的音乐，例如穆迪和桑基的赞美诗或叫我活下去，我会活成你的新教徒。他对罗西尼的《圣母颂》的钦佩也毫不逊色，这是一部不朽的作品，他的妻子玛丽昂·特威迪女士在其中获得了巨大的成功，他可以肯定地说，这引起了名副其实的轰动，极大地增加了她的其他荣誉和荣誉。在加德纳上街的耶稣会神父教堂里，这座神圣的建筑聚集在门口，聆听她与艺术大师，或者更确切地说是艺术大师的演奏，这让其他人完全黯然失色。大家一致认为，没有人能走到她面前，足以说明在一个崇拜神圣音乐的地方，普遍表达了对安可的渴望。总体而言，尽管他更喜欢《唐璜》描述的轻歌剧和《玛莎》，这是该剧中的瑰宝，但他对门德尔松等严肃的古典流派却有一种偏爱，尽管只有表面知识。 谈到这一点，他理所当然地知道所有关于旧时最爱的事情，他提到了莱昂内尔在《玛莎，玛帕里》中的出色表演，奇怪的是，他已经听到或无意中听到，更准确地说，在昨天，他非常欣赏这种特权，从斯蒂芬受人尊敬的父亲的口中，唱得完美，对数字的研究，事实上，这让所有其他人都退居二线。斯蒂芬在回答一个礼貌地提出的问题时说，他没有唱这首歌，而是开始赞扬莎士比亚的歌曲，至少是在那个时期或大约那个时期，居住在费特巷靠近草药师杰拉德的鲁特琴演奏家道兰，他ludendo hausi，Doulandus，他正在考虑从阿诺德·多尔梅奇（Arnold Dolmetsch）先生那里购买一种乐器，B.不太记得他了，尽管这个名字听起来确实很熟悉，为六十五基尼和法纳比和儿子与他们的杜克斯和来自自负和伯德（威廉）演奏他说，在女王的礼拜堂或其他任何地方他都发现了维金纳琴，还有一个制作玩具或架子的汤姆金斯和约翰牛。

On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.
他们正在接近的道路上，在秋千链之外，一匹马拖着扫地机，在铺好的地面上踱步，刷着一大片泥泞，因此布卢姆在噪音中不能完全确定他是否听对了这个暗示。六十五基尼和约翰牛。他询问约翰·布尔是否是同类的政治名人，他觉得这两个名字一模一样，真是惊人的巧合。

By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:
马儿被铁链拴着，慢慢地调转方向，一如往常警惕地警惕的布卢姆察觉到了这一点，轻轻地拉了拉对方的衣袖，戏谑地说道：

—Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.
——今晚我们的生命处于危险之中。小心压路机。

They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.
他们随即停了下来。布卢姆看着一匹不值六十五畿尼的马头，突然在附近的黑暗中显现出来，看起来很新，一组不同的骨头，甚至是肉，因为明显它是一个四足动物，一个摇屁股的人，一个黑屁股的人，一个尾随者，一个将后脚放在前面的头挂，而他的创造之主坐在栖息处，忙着思考。但他是个可怜的好人，他很遗憾自己没有一块糖，但正如他明智地反映的那样，你几乎无法为可能出现的每一个紧急情况做好准备。他只是一匹又大又神经质、傻乎乎的马，没有任何顾虑。但他想，即使是一只狗，和巴尼·基尔南店里那只同样大小的杂种狗相比，面对它也会是一种神圣的恐怖。但如果他像沙漠之船骆驼一样，在驼峰上将葡萄蒸馏成酒，那么这并不是动物的错。其中十分之九都可以关在笼子里或训练，除了蜜蜂之外，没有什么超出人类的艺术。鲸鱼带着鱼叉发夹，鳄鱼挠他的后背，他明白了这个笑话，用粉笔画一个圆圈代表一只公鸡，老虎代表我的鹰眼。当街道上的船在操纵时，斯蒂芬继续谈论非常有趣的旧事时，这些关于战场上的野兽的及时反思占据了他的注意力，有点分散了斯蒂芬的话。

—What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.
——我在说什么？是啊！他在投身于媒体资源时暗示，我的妻子将非常乐意结识您，因为她对任何类型的音乐都充满热情。

He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.
他以友好的方式侧身看着史蒂芬的侧脸，这是他母亲的形象，这与他们毫无疑问贪得无厌的通常英俊的流氓类型不太一样，因为他可能不是那样的身材。

Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.
尽管如此，假设他拥有父亲的天赋，正如他所想象的那样，这会在他的脑海中开启新的视野，比如芬格尔夫人的爱尔兰工业、前周一的音乐会以及一般的贵族阶层。

Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:
他现在在扬斯·皮特·斯韦林克（Jans Pieter Sweelinck）的广播节目《青春这里已结束》中描述了精致的变奏，他是一位来自阿姆斯特丹的荷兰人，皱眉就是从那里来的。他更喜欢约翰内斯·吉普车的一首古老的德国歌曲，歌曲讲述了清澈的大海和塞壬的声音，甜蜜的杀人犯，这让布鲁姆有点困惑：

Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
冯·德·塞雷宁·列表

Tun die Poeten dichten.
Tun die Poeten dichten。

These opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.
这些开场小节是他即兴演唱和翻译的。布鲁姆点点头，说他完全理解，并恳求他无论如何都要继续下去。

A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in—society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no mean.s to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much fêted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.
像这样异常美丽的男高音声音，是最罕见的恩赐，布鲁姆在他发出第一个音符时就欣赏它，如果由一些公认的声音制作权威（如巴拉克拉夫）妥善处理，并且能够将音乐解读为讨价还价，那么可以轻松地做到这一点，拥有自己的价格，其中男中音每便士十个，并在不久的将来为其幸运的拥有者获得进入时尚房屋的入场券，这些住宅区是大笔生意的金融巨头和拥有大学学士学位的有头衔的人。 （以它的方式来说是一个巨大的广告）并且绅士风度给人们留下了更好的印象，如果他的衣服保养得当，他将毫无疑问地获得明显的成功，拥有可以用于此目的和其他必需品的大脑。以便更好地赢得他们的青睐，因为他，一个年轻的上流社会着装新手，几乎不明白这样的小事会对你产生怎样的不利影响。事实上，仅仅几个月的时间，他就可以很容易地预见到他会在圣诞节的节日期间参加他们的音乐和艺术对话，以供选择，引起女性鸽舍的轻微震动，并受到很多关注。那些为了引起轰动的女士们，这些案例，正如他碰巧知道的那样，都被记录在案——事实上，在不泄露整个表演的情况下，他自己曾经，如果他愿意的话，可以很容易地泄露出来。当然，与学费齐头并进的金钱报酬也不容小觑。他补充说，并不是为了不义之财，他就必须将抒情平台当作在任何漫长的时间里进行的人生漫步。 但是，朝着所需方向迈出的一步，超出了是或否的范围，无论是在金钱上还是在精神上，这都没有体现出他最起码的尊严，而且在急需的时刻，当每一个小小的帮助都得到了一张支票时，它往往会变得异常方便。此外，尽管后来品味有所下降，但像这样的原创音乐，不同于传统的陈规，很快就会流行起来，因为在通常强加朗朗上口的男高音独奏的陈词滥调之后，这对都柏林的音乐界来说无疑是一种新鲜事。伊万·圣奥斯特尔（Ivan St Austell）和希尔顿圣贾斯特（Hilton St Just）以及他们的“全能”（genus omne）所描绘的一个值得信赖的公众。是的，毫无疑问，他可以凭借手中的所有牌，并且有一个资本机会为自己赢得名声并在这座城市的尊重中赢得很高的地位，在那里他可以指挥一个僵硬的人物，并且提前预订，为国王街房子的顾客举办一场盛大的音乐会，给予后援，如果有人即将把他踢上楼，可以这么说，一个很大的如果，然而，带有一些前进的推动力，以避免不可避免的拖延绊倒了一位受人欢迎的好朋友王子。而且它不需要丝毫损害另一个，因为作为他自己的主人，当他渴望这样做时，他会有大量的时间在业余时间练习文学，而不与他的声乐事业发生冲突或包含任何贬义的东西。这是他自己的事。事实上，球就在他脚下，而这正是另一个拥有敏锐鼻子、能嗅出任何老鼠气味的人紧紧抓住他的原因。

The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended.
马就在那时。后来，他在一个有利的机会（布鲁姆做到了），没有无论如何在傻瓜介入天使原则的地方窥探他的私人事务，建议他切断与某个崭露头角的实践者的联系，他注意到，这个实践者很容易受到蔑视甚至在不在场的时候，在某种程度上用一些搞笑的借口，贬低他，或者无论你喜欢怎么称呼它，在布鲁姆的谦卑看来，这对一个人性格的另一面投下了令人厌恶的侧面，没有双关语的意思。

The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.
可以说，这匹马已经到了拴绳的尽头，停下来，高高地扬起一条骄傲的羽毛尾巴，把它落在地板上，刷子很快就会把地板刷起来，擦亮，三个冒着烟的粪便球，增加了它的配额。他慢慢地、一次又一次地陷入了泥沼。他的司机仁慈地等待着他（或她）结束，耐心地坐在他的镰刀车里。

Side by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.
布鲁姆并肩而行，从意外中获利，史蒂芬穿过铁链的缝隙，被直立的人分开，跨过一片泥沼，朝加德纳街下游走去，史蒂芬唱得更大胆，但声音不大，民谣的结尾。

Und alle Schiffe brücken.
所有希夫布吕肯。

The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tête-à-tête (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car.
司机从来没有说过一句话，无论是好是坏，还是漠不关心，只是看着那两个人影，坐在他那辆黑色的低背车上，一满一倾，走向铁路桥，去接受马赫神父的婚礼。他们一边走，一边停下来，又走回来，继续他们的谈话（当然，他完全不参与），谈论的是人类理性的敌人海妖，同时也夹杂着许多其他同类话题：篡位者、这类历史案例，而扫地车里的人，或者你也可以称之为卧铺车里的人，无论如何都听不到，因为他们太远了，只是坐在靠近下加德纳街尽头的座位上，照顾他们的低背车。


* * * * *

What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
布鲁姆和斯蒂芬回来时遵循了哪些平行路线？

Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.
两人以正常的步行速度从贝雷斯福德出发，按照下加德纳街和中加德纳街以及西边的芒特乔伊广场的顺序前进：然后，以减慢的速度，每个方向离开，加德纳的地方不经意地走到了坦普尔的更远的角落街：然后，放慢脚步，中间停下来，向右走，走坦普尔街，向北，一直到哈德威克广场。他们以不同的步伐，以轻松的步伐接近，径直穿过乔治教堂前的马戏团，任何圆圈的弦都小于它所对的弧线。

Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
双维人在他们的行程中考虑了什么？

Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.
音乐、文学、爱尔兰、都柏林、巴黎、友谊、女人、卖淫、饮食、煤气灯或电弧光和辉光灯对邻近的副日光树生长的影响、暴露的公司紧急垃圾桶、罗马天主教堂、教会独身主义、爱尔兰民族、耶稣会教育、职业、医学研究、过去的一天、安息日前的邪恶影响、斯蒂芬的崩溃。

Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?
布鲁姆是否发现了他们各自对经历的相似和不同反应之间的相似之处？

Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.
两人都对艺术印象很敏感，音乐优于塑料或绘画。两人都更喜欢大陆生活方式而不是岛屿生活方式，更喜欢大西洋沿岸而不是跨大西洋的居住地。两人都受到早期家庭训练的影响，以及继承下来的顽强的异端抵抗精神，都公开表示不相信许多正统的宗教、民族、社会和伦理学说。两人都承认异性吸引力的影响时而刺激，时而迟钝。

Were their views on some points divergent?
他们对某些问题的看法是否存在分歧？

Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (died 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand.
斯蒂芬公开反对布鲁姆关于饮食和公民自助重要性的观点，而布鲁姆则默认反对斯蒂芬关于文学中对人的精神的永恒肯定的观点。布鲁姆秘密同意斯蒂芬对由教皇塞莱斯廷一世于公元 432 年派遣的卡尔波努斯之子帕特里克（帕特里克之子，波提图斯之子，奥德修斯之子）指定的爱尔兰民族从德鲁伊教改信基督教的日期所涉及的不合时宜的纠正。利里统治时期到 260 年左右，科马克·麦克阿特（Cormac MacArt，卒于公元 266 年）统治时期，因在斯莱蒂 (Sletty) 未能完全吞咽食物而窒息，并埋葬在罗斯纳里 (Rossnaree)。布鲁姆将这种崩溃归因于胃部营养不良以及某些不同程度的掺假和酒精浓度的化合物，而精神消耗和在轻松的气氛中快速圆周运动的速度加速了这种崩溃，斯蒂芬则将其归因于黎明云的重新出现（双方都感觉到了）从桑迪科夫和都柏林两个不同的观察点来看）起初并不比女人的手大。

Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
他们在某一点上的观点是否相同且持否定态度？

The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.
煤气灯或电灯对相邻副日光树生长的影响。

Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?
布鲁姆过去在夜间巡游时是否讨论过类似的话题？

In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.
1884 年，晚上，欧文·戈德堡 (Owen Goldberg) 和塞西尔·特恩布尔 (Cecil Turnbull) 在朗伍德大道和伦纳德街角、伦纳德街角和辛格街、辛格街和布卢姆菲尔德大道之间的公共大道上行走。

In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west.
1885 年的晚上，与珀西·阿普约翰 (Percy Apjohn) 一起，斜倚在直布罗陀别墅和厄珀克罗斯男爵领地克拉姆林的布卢姆菲尔德别墅之间的墙上。 1886 年，偶尔会在郊区线路的三等火车车厢门口、前厅里与泛泛之交和潜在购买者会面。 1888 年，他经常与布莱恩·特威迪少校和他的女儿玛丽昂·特威迪小姐一起或单独在朗德敦马修·狄龙家的休息室里。一次是在 1892 年，一次是在 1893 年，与朱利叶斯·马斯蒂安斯基 (Julius (Juda) Mastiansky) 在一起，两次都是在他位于西伦巴底街 (Bloom's) 的房子的客厅里。

What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?
在他们到达目的地之前，布鲁姆对 1884 年、1885 年、1886 年、1888 年、1892 年、1893 年、1904 年这些不规则的日期序列做了什么反思？

He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
他认为，个体发展和经验领域的逐步扩展，伴随着个体间关系的相反领域的限制。

As in what ways?
比如通过什么方式？

From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
从不存在到存在，他来到了许多人面前，就像一个人所接受的那样：存在与存在，他与任何人在一起，就像任何人与任何人一样：从存在到不存在，他将被所有人所感知。


What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
他们到达目的地后，布鲁姆做了什么行为？

At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
在埃克尔斯街7号等奇数第4号的家门口，他机械地把手伸进裤子后面的口袋里，拿到了钥匙。

Was it there?
在那里吗？

It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.
它就在他前一天穿过的裤子的相应口袋里。

Why was he doubly irritated?
他为何倍加恼怒？

Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.
因为他忘记了，因为他记得，他已经提醒过自己两次不要忘记。

What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
那么，在这对有意（分别）和无意中失去钥匙的夫妇面前，还有什么选择呢？

To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
进入或不进入。敲或不敲。

Bloom’s decision?
布鲁姆的决定？

A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.
计谋。他把脚搁在矮墙上，爬过区域栏杆，把帽子按在头上，抓住栏杆和栅栏下部结合处的两点，将身体逐渐降低五英尺九英寸半的长度，直到距离路面两英尺十英寸以内，并让他的身体在空间中自由移动，将自己与栏杆分开并蹲下以准备坠落的冲击。

Did he fall?
他摔倒了吗？

By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.
已知他的身体重量为 11 英石和 4 磅（以常衡标准衡量），这是由位于北部弗雷德里克街 19 号的药物化学家弗朗西斯·弗洛德曼 (Francis Froedman) 的定期自称量仪器在耶稣升天最后一次盛宴上所证明的。 ，基督教纪元一千九百零四年（犹太纪元五千六百六十四，伊斯兰教纪元一千三百二十二）的五月十二日，黄金数字5，第13纪，太阳周期9 ，罗马字母 C B，罗马起诉书 2，朱利安时期 6617，MCMIV。

Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
他是否没有因脑震荡而受伤？

Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.
重新获得新的稳定平衡后，他虽然受到了冲击，但没有受伤，而是站了起来，通过在其自由移动的凸缘上施加力，并通过在其支点上施加的第一种杠杆作用，抬起了区域门的闩锁，通过门延迟进入厨房。在相邻的洗碗间，通过摩擦点燃了荧光火柴，通过打开通风阀释放出易燃煤气，点燃了高火焰，通过调节，他将火焰降低到静止的白炽状态，最后点燃了一支便携式蜡烛。

What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
与此同时，斯蒂芬感知到了哪些离散的连续图像？

Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.
靠在区域栏杆上，他透过透明的厨房玻璃看到一个男人正在调节 14 CP 的煤气，一个男人点燃了一支 1 CP 的蜡烛，一个男人轮流脱掉他的两只靴子，一个男人拿着一支蜡烛离开厨房。

Did the man reappear elsewhere?
难道那个男人又出现在别处了？

After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
四分钟过去了，透过门厅门上的半透明半圆形玻璃扇灯，可以看到蜡烛的微光。走廊门在铰链上慢慢转动。门口的空地上，那个男人再次出现，没有戴帽子，手里拿着蜡烛。

Did Stephen obey his sign?
斯蒂芬遵守他的手势了吗？

Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house.
是的，他轻手轻脚地走进来，帮着关上门，用链子拴上，然后轻轻地沿着走廊，那人背着脚，点着蜡烛，穿过左边门口亮着灯的缝隙，小心翼翼地走下五级以上的旋转楼梯，进入大厅。布鲁姆家的厨房。

What did Bloom do?
布鲁姆做了什么？

He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
他在火焰上急促地呼气，熄灭了蜡烛，把两把勺座交易椅拉到炉石上，一把背对着窗子给斯蒂芬坐，另一把在必要时给他自己用，单膝跪在炉排上。一堆交叉放置的树脂尖木棍、各种彩色纸和不规则多边形的最好的艾布拉姆煤炭，价格为二十一先令一吨，来自多利尔街 14 号弗劳尔和麦当劳先生的院子，用一个点燃的纸的三个突出点将其点燃。路西法匹配，从而通过允许其碳和氢元素与空气中的氧自由结合来释放燃料中所含的势能。

Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
史蒂芬想到了什么类似的幽灵？

Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.
其他时间其他地方的其他人，单膝跪下或双膝跪下，为他点燃了火，迈克尔弟兄在基尔代尔县萨林斯克朗戈斯伍德的耶稣会学院医务室里：父亲西蒙·迪达勒斯 (Simon Dedalus) 在他位于都柏林菲茨吉本街 13 号的第一个住所的一间没有家具的房间里：他的教母凯特·莫坎小姐 (Kate Morkan Miss) 在亚瑟岛 15 号她垂死的妹妹朱莉娅·莫坎小姐 (Julia Morkan Miss) 的家里：他的姨妈莎拉 (Richie 的妻子) （理查德）古尔丁，在 Clanbrassil 街 62 号住所的厨房里：他的母亲玛丽，西蒙·迪达勒斯的妻子，在 1898 年圣弗朗西斯·泽维尔盛宴的早晨，在北里士满街 12 号的厨房里：院长的巴特神父在位于斯蒂芬绿地北部 16 号的大学学院物理剧院学习，他的妹妹迪莉（迪莉娅）在他父亲位于卡布拉的家里。

What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?
当斯蒂芬将目光抬高到距离火场一码的高度，看向对面的墙壁时，他看到了什么？

Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.
一排五个螺旋弹簧门铃下有一条曲线绳，在两个横穿烟囱墩旁凹处的固定器之间伸展，绳子上挂着四块小方形手帕，连续折叠成相邻的矩形，还有一对带有莱尔吊带顶部的女士灰色软管脚处于惯常位置，由三个直立的木钉夹住，其中两个位于其外侧末端，第三个位于其连接点。

What did Bloom see on the range?
布鲁姆在靶场看到了什么？

On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.
右侧（较小）滚刀上有一个蓝色搪瓷平底锅：左侧（较大）滚刀上有一个黑色铁水壶。

What did Bloom do at the range?
布鲁姆在靶场做了什么？

He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.
他把平底锅移到左边的炉灶上，起身把铁水壶拿到水槽边，转动水龙头，让水流流起来。

Did it flow?
流了吗？

Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of 5 pounds per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.
是的。从威克洛县的 Roundwood 水库，容量为 24 亿加仑，通过单管和双管过滤主管的地下渡槽渗透，该渡槽的初始工厂成本为每线性码 5 磅，途经 Dargle、Rathdown、Glen。从 Downs 和 Callowhill 到 Stillorgan 的 26 英亩水库，距离 22 法定英里，然后通过泄压水箱系统，以 250 英尺的坡度到达上 Leeson 街尤斯塔斯桥的城市边界，尽管从较长的距离由于夏季干旱和每日供应量为 12.5 亿加仑，水已降至溢流堰的窗台以下，因此区测量员和水厂工程师 Spencer Harty, C. E. 先生根据水厂委员会的指示禁止使用城市用水用于消费以外的目的（设想有可能像 1893 年那样使用大运河和皇家运河的非饮用水），特别是南都柏林监护人，尽管他们的配给量为每个穷人每天 15 加仑通过 6 英寸仪表，根据公司法律代理人 Ignatius Rice 先生的确认，被判每晚浪费 20,000 加仑，从而损害了该公司另一部分的利益。公共、自负盈亏的纳税人、有偿付能力、健全的。


What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?
回到射场的布卢姆，这位爱水者、提水者、提水者，对水有什么欣赏？

Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.

Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?
他把半满的水壶放在正在燃烧的煤上，为什么又回到仍在流水的水龙头呢？

To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
用一块部分消耗的巴林顿柠檬味肥皂片清洗脏手，肥皂上仍然粘着纸（十三小时前花四便士买的，但仍然没有付款），在新鲜的、不变的、不断变化的水中擦干，把脸和手擦干。长长的红边荷兰布穿过木制旋转滚筒。

What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?
由于火的作用，液体容器中发生了什么伴随现象？

The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
沸腾现象。在厨房和烟道之间不断上升的通风的推动下，点火从可燃燃料的柴堆传递到多面体的烟煤，其中含有压缩矿物形式的原始森林的叶状蜕膜化石，这些蜕膜反过来又衍生出它们的植物性存在来自太阳，原始热源（辐射），通过无所不在的发光透热以太传输。热量（对流）是由这种燃烧产生的一种运动方式，不断地、越来越多地从热化源传递到容器中所含的液体，通过金属铁的不均匀、未抛光的深色表面辐射，部分反射在部分被吸收，部分被传输，水温逐渐从常温升至沸点，这种温度升高可表示为将 1 磅水从 50 华氏度提高到 212 华氏度所需消耗 72 个热量单位。

To shave himself.
给自己刮胡子。

What advantages attended shaving by night?
晚上剃须有什么好处？

A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.
更柔软的胡须：如果故意在剃须过程中保留粘着的泡沫，则可以使用更柔软的刷子：如果在平常的时间意外地在偏远的地方遇到女性熟人，则皮肤会更柔软：对一天的进程进行安静的反思：醒来时感觉更干净自从清晨的噪音、预感和不安、牛奶罐的叮当作响、邮递员的两次敲门声、读完一份报纸、一边涂泡沫一边重读、在同一个地方重新涂泡沫、一次震惊、一次射击、想到他所寻求的一切（尽管毫无意义）之后，睡得更清新了。可能会导致剃须速度更快，并且会导致切口膏药粘附在切口上，切口膏药经过精确切割和湿润并涂抹：这是要做的。

他们的年龄之间存在什么关系？

16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.
16 年前，即 1888 年，当时布鲁姆与斯蒂芬现在的年龄相同，斯蒂芬 6 岁。16 年后，1920 年，斯蒂芬与布鲁姆现在的年龄相同时，布鲁姆 54 岁。1936 年，当时布鲁姆 70 岁，斯蒂芬 54 岁，他们的年龄最初是这样的比例16 比 0 相当于 17 1/2 到 13 1/2，随着任意未来年份的增加，比例增加，差距缩小，因为如果 1883 年存在的比例继续保持不变，认为这是可能的，直到那么1904年，当斯蒂芬22岁时，布鲁姆将是374岁，而在1920年，当斯蒂芬38岁时，布鲁姆将是646岁，而在1952年，当斯蒂芬将达到70岁的最大后洪水年龄时，布鲁姆已经活了1190岁。出生于 714 年的史蒂芬，将比最大的洪水前年龄（即玛土撒拉的 969 岁）高出 221 岁，而如果斯蒂芬继续活到公元 3072 年达到这个年龄，布鲁姆就不得不出生于公元前 81,396 年，已经活了 83,300 岁。

The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s Physical Strength and How to Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.

In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).

How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?

Condense Stephen’s commentary.
浓缩斯蒂芬的评论。

One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.
其中之一，也是最不重要的，是注定的受害者。一次是无意，两次是有意的，他挑战了自己的命运。当他被抛弃时，它就会不情愿地向他发起挑战，并作为希望和青春的幽灵，让他无法抗拒。它把他带到了一个奇怪的住所，一个秘密的异教徒公寓，在那里，他同意了，毫不留情地焚烧了他。

Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
主人（命中注定的受害者）为何悲伤？

He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.

In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
根据能量守恒定律。

Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?

He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
他权衡了支持和反对仪式谋杀的可能证据：等级制度的煽动，民众的迷信，真实性不断下降的谣言传播，对富裕的嫉妒，报复的影响，返祖犯罪的零星再现，狂热、催眠暗示和梦游的减轻情节。

From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?
他对哪些（如果有的话）精神或身体疾病不能完全免疫？

From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.
根据催眠暗示：有一次，他醒来时，没有认出自己正在睡觉的公寓；不止一次，醒来后，他已经无限期地无法移动或发出声音。梦游症：有一次，在睡觉时，他的身体向无热火的方向升起、蹲下、爬行，到达目的地后，他穿着睡衣，卷曲着身子，没有暖气，躺在那里睡觉。

1889 年 6 月 15 日。一名爱发牢骚的新生女婴通过哭泣来引起和缓解充血。一个孩子改名为帕德尼·索克斯，她震惊地摇晃着她的存钱罐：数了数他的三个免费的便士纽扣，一个，一个，一个，一个：一个洋娃娃，一个男孩，一个水手，她抛弃了：金发碧眼，两个黑人所生，她有金发碧眼的血统，遥远的，一次侵犯，豪普特曼·海诺先生，奥地利陆军，近处，幻觉，穆尔维中尉，英国海军。

On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).
她把篮球和跳绳放到了休息处。在公爵的草坪上，在一位英国访客的恳求下，她拒绝允许他制作并拿走她的照片（未说明反对意见）。在艾尔莎·波特的陪伴下，在南环路上，她沿着斯塔默街走到一半，然后突然折回（没有说明改变的原因）。在她出生 15 周年纪念日的守夜活动上，她从韦斯特米斯郡的穆林加尔写了一封信，简短地提到了当地的一名学生（未注明院系和年级）。

Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
预示着第二次分裂的第一次分裂是否折磨着他？

Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.

(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.

在被动性中，在节约中，在传统的本能中，在意外中。

As?
作为？

Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).
因为她倾斜着她的金发，让他为她绑上丝带（参见脖子上的猫）。此外，在斯蒂芬绿色的湖面自由表面上，在树木的倒影中，她未加注释的唾液描绘了水环的同心圆，其持久性表明了一条昏昏欲睡的匍匐鱼的轨迹（参见老鼠观察猫）。

Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.
再次，为了记住一次著名军事行动的日期、战斗人员、问题和后果，她把头发编成辫子（参见洗耳猫）。此外，愚蠢的米莉，她梦见与一匹名叫约瑟夫的马进行了一次无名的、不记得的对话，她向这匹马提供了一杯柠檬水，而它（他）似乎已经接受了（参见炉边做梦的猫）。因此，在被动性、经济性、传统本能、意外性上，他们的差异是相似的。

In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock), given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
他以什么方式利用作为婚姻占卜的礼物（1）一只猫头鹰，2）一只钟）来引起她的兴趣并指导她？

作为实物课程来解释：1）卵生动物的性质和习惯，空中飞行的可能性，某些视力异常，防腐剂的长期过程：2）钟摆的原理，以摆锤，齿轮和调节器为例，根据人类或社会对静止表盘上顺时针可移动指示器的各个位置的调节的翻译，当较长和较短的指示器处于相同的倾斜角度时，每小时中某一时刻的每小时重现的精确度，videlicet ，每小时过 5 5/11 分钟，按算术级数计算。

In what manners did she reciprocate?
她以什么方式回应呢？

She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.
她记得：在他出生 27 周年纪念日时，她送给他一个仿制皇冠德比瓷器制成的早餐小胡子杯。她说：在四分之一天左右，如果他不是为她购买的东西，她就会表现出对他的必需品的关注，并预测他的愿望。她钦佩：他向她解释了一种自然现象，她表达了立即渴望拥有他的科学知识的一小部分，一半，四分之一，千分之一的愿望，而不是逐渐获得。

What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?

What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?
是什么让布鲁姆在实现这些相互排斥的命题时遇到了困难？

The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.
过去的不可挽回：有一次，在都柏林拉特兰广场的圆形大厅里，阿尔伯特·亨格勒的马戏团表演时，一位直觉的彩色小丑在寻找亲子关系，从表演场渗透到礼堂的一个地方，布鲁姆孤独地坐在那儿，公开向兴奋的观众宣布他（布鲁姆）是他（小丑）的爸爸。未来的不可预见性：有一次，1898 年夏天，他（布鲁姆）在一个弗罗林 (2/-) 的铣边上标记了三个凹口，并将其用于支付 J. 和 T 收到的应付账款。戴维，家庭杂货店，1 Charlemont Mall，大运河，用于公民金融水域的流通，用于可能的、迂回的或直接的返回。

Never.
绝不。

Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?

因为在人类生存的关键转折点，他希望改变许多社会条件，这些条件是不平等、贪婪和国际敌意的产物。他当时就相信，消除了这些条件，人类的生命就无限完美了？

There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.
与人类法不同，作为人类整体不可分割的一部分，自然所施加的一般条件仍然存在：为了获得食物而进行破坏的必要性：分离存在的最终功能的痛苦特征，出生和死亡的痛苦：猿猴和（特别是）人类女性从青春期到更年期的单调月经：海上、矿山和工厂中不可避免的事故：某些非常痛苦的疾病及其导致的外科手术，先天性精神错乱和先天性犯罪，毁灭性的流行病：使恐怖成为人类心理基础的灾难性灾难：震中位于人口稠密地区的地震剧变：生命成长的事实，通过蜕变的抽搐，从婴儿期到成熟期到衰败。

Why did he desist from speculation?

Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.
因为对于高智商来说，用其他更容易接受的现象来代替要消除的不太可接受的现象是一项任务。

Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
斯蒂芬也参与了他的沮丧吗？

He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.

Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
对进化的思考越来越广泛：月亮在初月时看不见，接近近地点：无限的拉长闪烁的未凝结的银河系，放置在从表面向下沉入 5000 英尺的圆柱形垂直轴下端的观察者在日光下可见地球的中心：天狼星（大犬座的α），距离10光年（57,000,000,000,000英里），体积是我们星球尺寸的900倍：大角星：岁差：猎户座，带带和六重太阳θ和可以容纳 100 个太阳系的星云：垂死的恒星和新生的新星，如 1901 年的新星：我们的系统坠向武仙座：所谓恒星的视差或视差漂移，实际上是永远移动的流浪者从不可估量的遥远的亿万年到无限遥远的未来，与之相比，人类生命的三十年和十年，形成了无限短暂的括号。

Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
内卷的正面思考是否越来越少？

Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
记录在地球分层中的亿万个地质时期：隐藏在地球空洞中、可移动的石头下、蜂巢和土堆中的无数微小的昆虫有机存在，微生物、病菌、细菌、杆菌、精子：不可估量的数万亿亿亿难以察觉的分子通过分子亲和力凝聚在一个针头中：由红色和白色物体组成的人类血清宇宙，它们本身是由其他物体组成的虚空宇宙，每个物体都连续地构成其宇宙由可分割的组成机构组成，其中每个又可再分为可再分的组成机构的部门，红利和除数在没有实际分割的情况下不断减少，直到如果进展足够远，就没有任何地方永远不会达到。

Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
他为什么不将这些计算细化到更精确的结果呢？

Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of .the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
因为几年前的 1886 年，当他忙于解决圆的正交问题时，他了解到存在一个以相对精确度计算的数字，其大小和位置如此之多，例如 9 次方9的9次方，得到的结果是，必须征用33本密印本，每本1000页，每本都有无数的印度纸，以包含其印刷的整数单位的完整故事，数十、数百、数千、数万、数十万、数百万、数千万、数亿、数十亿，每个系列的每一个数字的星云核心都简明地包含了被提升到最大动力学阐述的潜力其任何权力的任何权力。

Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
他是否发现行星及其卫星的宜居性问题更容易解决？

Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.
难度不同。意识到正常情况下能够承受 19 吨大气压力的人体有机体，当在陆地大气中升高到相当高的高度时，会遭受算术级数强度的影响，根据对流层和平流层之间的分界线近似于鼻出血，呼吸受阻和眩晕，当提出解决这个问题时，他推测这是一个工作假设，但无法证明不可能，即在火星人、水星人、金星人、木星人、土星人的统治下，可能存在一个适应性更强、解剖结构不同的生物种族，海王星或天王星的充分和等价条件，尽管以不同形式创造的最高人类，具有有限的差异，导致整体和彼此相似，但在这里，仍然不可改变地、不可剥夺地依附于虚荣、虚荣的虚荣和一切那是虚荣。

And the problem of possible redemption?
还有可能赎回的问题吗？

The minor was proved by the major.
小事由大事证明。

Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?
依次考虑了星座的哪些不同特征？

The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, lo August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.
不同颜色代表不同程度的活力（白色、黄色、深红色、朱红色、朱砂色）：它们的明亮程度：它们的大小显示到第七宫（包括第七宫）：它们的位置：马车夫之星：沃尔辛厄姆方式：大卫的战车：土星的环形环带：螺旋星云凝结成太阳：双太阳相互依存的旋转：伽利略、西蒙·马里乌斯、皮亚齐、勒维耶、赫歇尔、加勒的独立同步发现：波德和开普勒对立方体的系统化尝试公转时间的距离和平方：多毛彗星的几乎无限的可压缩性及其从近日点到远日点的巨大椭圆形离去和再入轨道：流星石的恒星起源：关于年轻彗星诞生时期的利比亚洪水占星学家：每年在圣节盛宴期间都会出现流星雨。 劳伦斯（烈士，八月）：被称为新月的每月重现，旧月在她怀里：天体对人体的假定影响：出现一颗在白天和黑夜都极其明亮的恒星（一级） （两个不发光的前太阳在白炽状态下碰撞和合并产生的新的发光太阳）关于威廉·莎士比亚在仙后座卧着的永不落座的三角洲上空诞生的时期，以及一颗起源相似但等级较小的恒星（第二等）大约在利奥波德·布鲁姆诞生时期，在七日冕座中出现和消失的光辉，以及其他（可能）类似起源的恒星（实际上或可能）在仙女座中出现和消失的时间，大约在史蒂芬·迪达勒斯出生的时期，以及在小鲁道夫·布鲁姆出生和死亡后几年在御夫座的出生时期，以及在其他人出生或死亡之前或之后的几年在其他星座中和来自其他星座的时期：日食和月食的伴随现象，从沉浸到浮现，风的减弱，阴影的过渡，有翼生物的沉默，夜间或黄昏动物的出现，地狱之光的持续存在，陆地水域的模糊，人类的苍白。

His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?
他（布鲁姆）在权衡问题并考虑到可能的错误后得出的合乎逻辑的结论？

That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.
它不是天堂树，不是天堂树，不是天堂兽，也不是天堂人。它是一个乌托邦，没有从已知到未知的已知方法：通过一个或多个相同或不同大小的物体的假设并置，可以呈现出同样有限的无限：固定在空间中的虚幻形式的流动性，在空气中重新流动：在其可能的观众进入实际存在之前，过去可能已经不再作为现在存在。

Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
他是否更相信这一奇观的美学价值？

Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.
毫无疑问，这是由于诗人在疯狂的依恋中的谵妄或在拒绝中的屈辱中所反复出现的例子，引起了热情的同情星座或他们星球的卫星的冷漠。

Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?
那么他是否接受了占星术对月下灾难影响的理论作为一种信仰？

It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
在他看来，这既是反驳的证据，也是其月相图表中使用的术语，既可归因于可验证的直觉，也可归因于错误的类比：梦之湖、雨之海、露水之湾、丰产之海。

What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?
在他看来，月亮和女人之间存在什么特殊的密切关系？

Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.
她在地球上历代的古老和幸存的世代中的古老性：她的夜间优势：她的卫星依赖性：她的光辉反射：她在所有阶段的恒定性，在她指定的时间升起和落下，盈亏：她的外观被迫不变：她的不确定性对否定性审讯的回应：她对污水和污水的能力：她迷恋、羞辱、投资美丽、使人疯狂、煽动和帮助犯罪的能力：她面容的平静的神秘性：她孤立的统治者的可怕难以平息的辉煌近处：她的暴风雨和平静的预兆：她的光的刺激，她的运动和她的存在：她的火山口，她干旱的海洋，她的沉默的警告：她可见时的辉煌：她看不见时的吸引力。

What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?
什么可见的发光标志吸引了布鲁姆，也吸引了斯蒂芬的目光？

In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
在他（布鲁姆）房子的二楼（rere），一盏带有斜灯罩的石蜡油灯的光投射在弗兰克·奥哈拉（Frank O'Hara）提供的卷帘屏幕上，百叶窗、窗帘杆和旋转百叶窗制造商，安吉尔街 16 号。

How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
他如何阐明一个看不见的、有魅力的人——他的妻子玛丽昂（莫莉）布鲁姆——由一个可见的辉煌标志——一盏灯所代表的神秘面纱？

With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.
带有间接和直接的口头暗示或肯定：带有柔和的感情和钦佩：带有描述：带有障碍：带有建议。

Both then were silent?
然后两人都沉默了？

Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
沉默着，每个人都在镜子里注视着对方，镜子里都是他们彼此的面孔。

Were they indefinitely inactive?
他们是否无限期地不活跃？

At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.
在斯蒂芬的建议下，在布鲁姆的怂恿下，先是斯蒂芬，然后是布鲁姆，在半影中小便，他们的两侧相邻，他们的排尿器官通过手动环绕而相互变得不可见，他们的目光，首先是布鲁姆的，然后是斯蒂芬的，被提升到投射的发光和半发光阴影。

Similarly?
相似地？

The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.
他们先是连续排尿，然后同时排尿的轨迹是不同的：布卢姆的排尿时间较长，不那么粗鲁，以分叉的倒数第二个字母的不完整形式，他在高中的最后一年（1880年）已经能够达到这一点与该机构的整体并发强度相比，210名学者的最高海拔：斯蒂芬的更高，更嘶嘶声，他在前一天的最后几个小时内通过利尿消耗增加了持续的膀胱压力。

What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
关于对方看不见的、可听见的附属器官，双方都遇到了哪些不同的问题？

To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.
绽放：烦躁、肿胀、僵硬、反应性、尺寸、卫生、多毛的问题。

To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.
致斯蒂芬：耶稣受割礼的圣职完整性问题（一月一日，有义务听弥撒并放弃不必要的奴役工作的假期）以及神圣的包皮，神圣罗马天主教使徒教会的肉欲新娘戒指是否神圣的问题，在卡尔卡塔保存下来，值得简单的超适当的或第四级的latria，根据头发和脚趾甲等神圣赘生物的脱落。

What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
两人同时观测到的天象是什么？

A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
一颗恒星以极高的视速度从织女星的天顶上方的七弦琴中以极大的视速度穿过苍穹，越过贝雷尼斯之辫星群，向黄道星座狮子座飞去。

How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?
向心留置器如何为离心留置器提供出口？

By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
通过将有棱角的公钥匙的筒插入不稳定的母锁的孔中，在钥匙的弓上获得购买并将其从右向左转动，从订书钉上拔出螺栓，向内痉挛地拉动过时的未铰链的门并露出一个自由进出的孔。

How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
他们是如何分手的？

Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
他们的告别手臂垂直地站在同一扇门的不同侧面，在任何一点相交并形成小于两个直角之和的任何角度。

What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
什么声音伴随着他们的切线的结合，以及他们（分别）离心手和向心手的分离？

The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.
圣乔治教堂的钟声敲响了夜晚的钟声。

What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
双方都听到了什么样的声音回声？

By Stephen:
斯蒂芬：

Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.
红叶百合。图尔马环德特。

Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.
Iubilantium te virginum。合唱曲。

By Bloom:
布卢姆：

Heigho, heigho,
嘿嘿嘿嘿

Heigho, heigho.
嘿嘿，嘿嘿。

Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?
那天，按照钟声的命令，随布鲁姆一起从南部的桑迪蒙特前往北部的格拉斯内文的公司的几名成员在哪里？

Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).

Alone, what did Bloom hear?
独自一人，布鲁姆听到了什么？

The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.
后退的脚步在天生大地上的双重回响，犹太竖琴在共鸣巷中的双重振动。

Alone, what did Bloom feel?
独自一人，布鲁姆有何感受？

The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Reaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
星际空间的寒冷，比冰点低数千度或华氏度、摄氏度或罗穆尔氏度的绝对零度：黎明即将来临的最初迹象。

Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?
铃声、触碰、脚步声和寂寞让他想起了什么？

Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).
现已在不同地点以不同方式去世的同伴：珀西·阿普约翰（Percy Apjohn）（在行动中阵亡，莫德河）、菲利普·吉利根（Philip Gilligan）（肺结核，杰维斯街医院）、马修·F·凯恩（Matthew F. Kane）（意外溺水，都柏林湾）、菲利普·莫伊塞尔（Philip Moisel）（败血症，海茨伯里）街）、迈克尔·哈特（肺结核，Mater Misericordiae 医院）、帕特里克·迪格纳姆（中风，桑迪蒙特）。

What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
什么样的前景或现象促使他留下来？

The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.
最后三颗恒星的分离、黎明的扩散、新太阳圆盘的出现。

Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
他曾经是这些现象的旁观者吗？

Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.
1887 年，有一次，在卢克·道尔 (Luke Doyle) 金马奇 (Kimmage) 的家里进行了一场长时间的猜谜游戏后，他坐在墙上，耐心地等待着昼夜现象的出现，他的目光转向东方米兹拉赫 (Mizrach) 的方向。

He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
他还记得最初的现象吗？

More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
更加活跃的空气，远方的黎明公鸡，不同地点的教会时钟，鸟类音乐，早期徒步旅行者孤立的脚步，看不见的发光体的光的可见扩散，在低处可见的复苏太阳的第一根金色肢体地平线。

Did he remain?
他留下来了吗？

With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.
他带着深深的灵感回来了，重新穿过花园，重新进入通道，重新关上门。他短暂地吸了一口气，重新点燃了蜡烛，重新走上楼梯，重新靠近前厅、大厅的门，然后重新进入。

What suddenly arrested his ingress?
是什么突然阻止了他的进入？

The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
他的颅骨空心球体的右颞叶与一个实心木材角接触，在极小但可感知的几分之一秒后，由于先前的感觉传递和记录而产生了疼痛的感觉。

Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.
描述对家具的处置所造成的改变。

A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
一张用李子毛绒装饰的沙发从门对面搬到了靠近卷曲的英国国旗的角落（他经常打算进行这样的改动）：蓝白格子镶嵌珐琅的桌子被放置在门对面的房间里。梅子毛绒沙发腾出的位置：胡桃木餐具柜（其突出的角度暂时阻止了他的进入）已从门旁边的位置移动到门前更有利但更危险的位置：两把椅子被放了从壁炉边的左右移动到原来放置蓝白格子镶嵌珐琅桌子的位置。

Describe them.
描述他们。

One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.
其中之一：一把矮胖的填充安乐椅，粗壮的手臂伸展开来，靠背向椅背倾斜，椅背在后坐力的作用下被弹开，然后翻转了一块长方形地毯的不规则边缘，现在在其软垫充足的座椅上呈现出集中扩散和逐渐减弱的变色。另一把：一张细长的八字脚椅子，光滑的藤条曲线，直接放在前者对面，它的框架从顶部到座位，从座位到底部都涂有深棕色清漆，座位是一圈明亮的白色灯芯草编成的圆圈。

What significances attached to these two chairs?
这两把椅子有什么意义？

Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
相似性、姿势、象征意义、间接证据、证言超人的意义。

What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
原来餐边柜占据的位置被什么占据了？

A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love’s Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained pedal, ritirando, close.
一架立式钢琴（卡德比），键盘外露，其封闭的棺材支撑着一双长长的黄色女式手套和一个翡翠烟灰缸，里面装有四根已用完的火柴，一支部分消耗的香烟和两根变色的香烟头，其乐谱架支撑着琴键中的音乐爱的老甜歌的 G 自然人声和钢琴（由 G. Clifton Bingham 作词，由 J. L. Molloy 作曲，由 Antoinette Sterling 女士演唱）在最后一页打开，最后一页显示随意、强强、踏板、动画、持续踏板，ritirando，关闭。

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
布鲁姆带着什么样的感觉来思考这些物体的旋转？

With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.
紧张时，举起烛台；疼痛时，感觉到右太阳穴上有挫伤的肿块；注意力时，将目光集中在一个巨大的、暗淡的被动和细长的明亮的主动上；带着恳求，弯曲和下翻上翻的地毯流苏；带着娱乐，回忆马拉奇·穆里根博士的色彩方案包含绿色的渐变：愉快地重复单词和先前的行为，并通过内部感受的各种渠道感知随之而来的、随之而来的逐渐变色的温和宜人的扩散。

His next proceeding?
他的下一步行动是什么？

From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.
他从镶着珐琅的桌子上的一个打开的盒子里拿出一个一英寸高的黑色小圆锥体，把它放在一个小锡盘上的圆形底座上，把他的烛台放在壁炉架的右角上，从他的背心上拿出一张折叠的书页。题为《Agendath Netaim》的招股说明书（如图所示），将其展开，进行表面检查，将其卷成薄圆柱体，在烛火中点燃，点燃时将其涂在圆锥体的顶点，直到圆锥体达到粗糙的阶段，将其放置在烛台盆中的圆柱体以促进完全燃烧的方式处理其未消耗的部分。

What followed this operation?
这个操作之后发生了什么？

The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
这座小型火山的截锥形火山口顶部散发着垂直而蜿蜒的烟雾，散发着东方芳香的香气。

What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?

Did the process of divestiture continue?
剥离过程是否继续进行？

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.
他感觉到脚底有一种良性的持续疼痛，他把脚向一侧伸出，观察在几个不同方向反复行走过程中因脚压而产生的折痕、突起和突出点，然后斜着把花边解开，解开。松开鞋带，第二次脱掉两只靴子，从前部把部分湿透的右袜子（大脚趾的指甲再次折断）脱下来，抬起右脚，解开紫色松紧带。吊袜带，脱掉右袜子，将赤裸的右脚放在椅子的座位边缘，轻轻地抠破大脚趾突出的部分，将撕破的部分举到鼻孔处，吸入了臭味。然后，很快地，满意地扔掉了撕裂的指甲碎片。

Why with satisfaction?
为什么满意？

Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other ungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.
因为吸入的气味与吸入的其他指甲碎片的气味相对应，这些指甲碎片是由埃利斯夫人少年学校的学生布卢姆大师每天晚上耐心地进行短暂的跪拜、夜间祈祷和雄心勃勃的冥想而挑选和撕裂的。

What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?
他对这个系列的最后一个成员和这张床的最后一位占有者有什么看法？

Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
反思他的活力（一个边界）、身体比例（一个大字贴纸）、商业能力（一个最好的）、易受影响的（一个自吹自擂的人）。

Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?
除了活力、身材比例和商业能力之外，为什么还要让观察者印象深刻呢？

Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.
因为他在同一系列的前几位成员中越来越频繁地观察到同样的色欲，这种色欲是火爆地传播的，首先是警觉，然后是理解，然后是欲望，最后是疲劳，交替出现着理解和忧虑的症状。

With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?
他后来的反思受到了哪些敌对情绪的影响？

Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
嫉妒、嫉妒、克制、平静。

Envy?
嫉妒？

Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.
一种身体和精神上的男性有机体，特别适合精力充沛的人类交配和充满活力的活塞和汽缸运动的上位姿势，这是完全满足驻留在身体和精神上的女性有机体中的恒定但不尖锐的性欲所必需的，被动但不迟钝。

Jealousy?
妒忌？

Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
因为在其游离状态下性质充分且易挥发，因此交替地成为吸引剂和试剂。因为试剂和试剂之间的吸引力在任何时刻都在变化，以反比例的增加和减少，不断地循环延伸和径向折返。因为如果需要的话，对吸引力波动的受控沉思会产生愉悦感的波动。

Abnegation?
放弃？

In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.
凭借 a) 于 1903 年 9 月在伊甸码头 5 号创办乔治·梅西亚斯 (George Mesias) 商业裁缝和服装商时开始的相识，b) 实物款待，亲自回报和重新分配，c) 相对年轻，受到野心冲动的影响和宽宏大量，同事利他主义和多情的利己主义，d）种族外的吸引力，种族内的抑制，超种族的特权，e）即将到来的省级音乐巡演，共同的日常开支，净收益分割。

Equanimity?
平静？

As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
就像自然生物根据他、她和他们的自然本性、不同的相似性在自然本性中表达或理解的任何自然行为一样自然。其灾难性还不如地球因与暗日相撞而发生的灾难性毁灭那么严重。与盗窃相比，公路抢劫、虐待儿童和动物、以虚假借口获取金钱、伪造、贪污、挪用公款、背叛公众信任、装病、伤害他人、腐败未成年人、刑事诽谤、敲诈勒索、藐视法庭等罪名更应受到谴责。法庭、纵火、叛国、重罪、公海叛变、侵入、入室盗窃、越狱、不自然的恶行、从战场上的武装部队开小差、伪证、偷猎、高利贷、向国王的敌人提供情报、冒充、刑事袭击、过失杀人、故意和有预谋的谋杀。与所有其他适应改变的生存条件的平行过程相比，这并不更异常，导致身体有机体及其伴随的环境、食物、饮料、后天习惯、沉迷的倾向、重大疾病之间的相互平衡。因为这不仅仅是不可避免的，也是无法挽回的。

Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
为什么克制多于嫉妒，嫉妒少而平静？

From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.
从愤怒（婚姻）到愤怒（通奸），除了愤怒（交配）之外，什么也没有出现，但婚姻被侵犯者的婚姻侵犯者并没有被通奸者的通奸者所激怒。

What retribution, if any?
如果有的话会受到什么报应？

Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. Hushmoney by moral influence possibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.
暗杀，永远不会，因为两个错误并不能说明一个正确。决斗，不。离婚，不是现在。通过机械装置（自动床）或个人证词（隐蔽的目击证人）来曝光，目前还没有。诉讼通过法律影响或模拟攻击造成的损害，并有遭受伤害（自伤）的证据，并非不可能。封口费可能是受到道德影响。如果有的话，积极的，纵容，引入竞争（物质上，一个繁荣的宣传竞争机构：道德上，一个成功的亲密竞争代理），贬低，疏远，羞辱，分离，保护分离者与另一个分离者，保护分离者免受两者的影响。

By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
作为一个反对不确定性的有意识的反应者，他通过什么反思来证明自己的观点是正确的？

The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.
处女膜注定脆弱：事物本身的无形性：计划要做的事情的自我延长的张力与所做的事情的自我缩短的松弛之间的不协调和不相称；错误地推断出女性的虚弱：男性的肌肉发达：道德准则的变化：通过倒装实现的自然语法转换，不涉及不定过去时命题的意义改变（解析为男性主语，单音节拟声及物动词和直接女性宾语） ）从主动语态到被动语态中相关的不定过去时命题（解析为阴性主语、助动词和准单音节拟声词过去分词与互补的阳性施动者）：精液通过世代的持续产物：通过蒸馏不断生产精液：胜利、抗议或辩护的徒劳：所颂扬的美德的空洞：近代物质的昏睡：星星的冷漠。

In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
这些对立的情绪和反思，简化为最简单的形式，最终以何种满足方式汇聚在一起？

Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
对东半球和西半球、所有已探索或未探索的可居住土地和岛屿（午夜太阳之地、受祝福的岛屿、希腊群岛、应许之地）中普遍存在的脂肪前部和后部感到满意雌性半球，散发着牛奶和蜂蜜的香气，散发着排泄的乐观和精液的温暖，让人想起曲线幅度的世俗家庭，不受印象情绪或表达相反的影响，表现出沉默不变的成熟动物性。

The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
不满意的明显迹象？

An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.
近似的勃起：殷切的厌恶：逐渐的提升：试探性的启示：沉默的沉思。

Then?
然后？

He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
他亲吻她臀部那肥厚、香甜、散发着甜香的瓜子，在每个丰满的瓜子半球上，在它们香黄的皱纹里，进行着隐秘的、长时间的、挑衅性的瓜子与香瓜的接触。

The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
术后满意的明显迹象？

A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
沉默的沉思：试探性的探索：逐渐的谦卑：关切的厌恶：即将勃起。

What followed this silent action?
这个无声的举动之后发生了什么？

Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.
昏昏欲睡的祈祷，较不昏昏欲睡的识别，初期的兴奋，教义问答式的询问。

With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?
叙述者在回答这个询问时做了哪些修改？

Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of LEAH at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36 and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entituled SWEETS OF SIN, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.
负面：他没有提及玛莎·克利福德和亨利·弗劳尔之间的秘密通信，在伯纳德·基尔南有限公司（小不列颠街 8、9 和 10 号）的许可经营场所及其附近发生的公开争吵，以及色情挑衅以及因姓氏不详的格特鲁德（Gerty）的暴露癖而引起的反应。正面：他提到了 LEAH 的 Bandmann Palmer 女士在南国王街 46、47、48、49 号欢乐剧院的演出，邀请在下修道院街 35、36 和 37 号永利（墨菲）酒店吃晚饭，一本名为《罪恶的甜蜜》的小色情倾向卷，匿名作者，时尚绅士，在事后体操表演过程中错误计算的动作造成的暂时脑震荡，受害者（现已完全康复）是斯蒂芬·迪达勒斯，教授兼作家西蒙·迪达勒斯（Simon Dedalus）幸存的长子，没有固定职业，他（叙述者）在目击者在场的情况下完成了一项航空壮举，教授和作者如上所述，决策迅速，体操灵活。

What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?
在这种断断续续且越来越简洁的叙述过程中，听众和叙述者对自己的活动有何限制和对夫妻权利的抑制？

By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the lo September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.
听者认为，生育能力受到限制，因为结婚是在她出生 18 周年纪念日（1870 年 9 月 8 日）后 1 个日历月举行的。 10 月 8 日，与 1889 年 6 月 15 日出生的女性同日同房，同年 9 月预期同房，并在自然女性器官内射精，完成性交，最后发生了 5 周以前，即。 1893年11月27日，到1893年12月29日第二个（也是唯一的男性）孩子出生，1894年1月9日去世，年仅11天，还有10年5个月18天的时间，在此期间性交不完全，没有在自然女性器官内射精。叙述者在精神和身体上的活动受到限制，因为自从1903年9月15日叙述者和听众的女性后代进入青春期以来，他和听众之间没有发生完整的精神交流，这表明叙述者和听众的女性后代，还剩下9个月零1天的时间，在此期间，由于完美的女性（听众和问题者）之间预先确定的自然理解和不理解，完全的身体行动自由受到限制。

How?
如何？

By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.
通过各种反复的女性询问，涉及男性的目的地、地点、时间、持续时间、在暂时缺席的情况下所投射或影响的对象。

What moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible thoughts?
是什么在听众和叙述者的无形思想之上明显地移动？

The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
灯和灯罩的向上反射，一系列不断变化的光影渐变的同心圆。

In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
听者和叙述者分别向哪些方向撒谎？

In what state of rest or motion?
处于什么静止或运动状态？

At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.
相对于自己和彼此而言处于静止状态。在运动中，它们各自向西、向前和返回，通过地球的固有永久运动穿过永不改变的空间的不断变化的轨道。

In what posture?
以什么姿势？

Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
听者：半侧倾斜，向左，左手放在头下，右腿伸直并搁在左腿上，弯曲，呈Gea-Tellus姿势，满足，躺着，大种子。旁白：侧身向左倾斜，左右腿弯曲，右手的食指和拇指放在鼻梁上，姿势如珀西·阿普约翰（Percy Apjohn）拍摄的快照照片中所描绘的，疲倦的孩子，男孩在子宫里。

Womb? Weary?

* * * * *

Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byron’s poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they
是的，因为自从在City Arms酒店之后，他以前从来没有做过这样的事，要求在床上吃早餐和几个鸡蛋，当时他用病态的声音假装躺着，做殿下让自己变得有趣的事情。那个老基佬赖尔丹夫人，他以为自己有一条很棒的腿，她从来没有给我们留下一分钱，所有的一切都是为了她自己和她灵魂上最大的守财奴，实际上害怕为她的甲基化精神铺出 4d 告诉我她所有的疾病她有太多关于政治、地震和世界末日的老话题了，让我们先玩点乐子吧，如果所有的女人都像她那样穿着泳衣和低领衫，上帝会帮助世界的，当然没人想让她穿它们，我想她很虔诚，因为没有男人会看她两次，我希望我永远不会像她一样，这是一个奇迹，她不希望我们遮住脸，但她肯定是一个受过良好教育的女人，她饶舌地谈论这里的赖尔丹先生和那里的赖尔丹先生，我想他很高兴能离开她和她的狗，闻着我的毛皮味，总是在我的衬裙下站起来，尤其是在那时，我仍然喜欢他对这样的老妇人以及服务员和乞丐的礼貌，他不是凭空感到骄傲，但并不总是如此如果他真的有什么严重的事情，他们最好去一家一切都干净的医院，但我想我得让他受苦一个月，是的，然后我们下一步就会有一名医院护士地毯让他呆在那里，直到他们把他赶出去，或者是一个修女，也许就像他有的那张肮脏的照片一样，她和我一样是修女，不是，因为他们生病时很虚弱，很虚弱，如果他的鼻子流血，他们希望有一个女人康复哦，那是一场悲剧，当他从南环线驶过时，他看上去快要死了。那天我在舒格洛夫山的唱诗班聚会上扭伤了脚，那天我穿那件衣服斯塔克小姐给他送花，是她能在篮子底部找到的最糟糕的旧花，任何可以进入男人卧室的东西，用她老女仆的声音试图想象他因为她而死去，再也见不到你的脸了，尽管他看起来更像一个男人，胡子在床上长了一点，父亲也是一样，除了我讨厌用剃刀削皮割伤脚趾时包扎和用药他的鸡眼担心他会中毒，但如果这是我生病的事情，那么我们只会看到什么注意，当然，女人隐藏它，不要给他们带来所有麻烦，是的，他来了某个地方，我确信他的胃口无论如何都不会喜欢它或他他会因为想她而失去理智，所以要么是那些夜里的女人之一，如果他真的在那里，而旅馆的故事，他编造了一堆谎言来隐藏它，计划它海因斯让我认识了谁，是的，我你还记得芒通和谁让我看到那个大娃娃脸吗？我看到他，他结婚不久就在普尔斯·米里奥拉马和一个年轻女孩调情，当他溜出去时，我转身背对着他，看上去很清楚有什么伤害，但他有有一次厚颜无耻地向我补偿，他的嘴巴全能，他的眼睛像我见过的所有大傻瓜一样，那是所谓的律师，只是因为我讨厌在床上长时间争吵，否则如果不是这样的话，那就有点小了是的，因为前天他正在写信，当我走进前屋向他展示迪格纳姆死在房间里时，他在某个地方混在一起，或者偷偷地认识了他。好像有什么事情告诉我，他用吸墨纸盖住它，假装在思考商业问题哦，很可能就是这样的人，她认为她对他很软弱，因为所有男人在他这个年纪都会有一点这样，尤其是现在他已经四十岁了，以便从他身上骗取任何钱，而不是像一个傻瓜一样。老傻瓜，然后通常亲吻我的屁股是为了隐藏它，而不是我现在关心两根吸管他和谁一起做或者以前认识的人，尽管我想知道，只要我没有把他们两个都放在我的鼻子底下就像玛丽在安大略露台上遇到的那个荡妇一样，她用假屁股垫着，让他兴奋得足以让他闻到那些涂过衣服的女人的气味，有一两次，当我发现他让他靠近我时，我产生了怀疑。当我走进厨房假装他在喝水时，他的外套上长长的头发没有那根，1个女人对他们来说还不够，这都是他的错，当然毁了仆人，然后提议如果你愿意的话，她可以在圣诞节那天在我们的餐桌上吃饭哦，不，谢谢你，没有在我家里偷我的土豆和牡蛎，如果你愿意的话，每人 2/6 出去见她的阿姨，所以是普通抢劫，但我确信他与那件事有关，我需要找出答案类似这样的事情，他说你没有证据，这是她的证据哦，是的，她阿姨非常喜欢牡蛎，但我告诉她我对她建议我出去单独和她在一起的想法，我不会降低自己去监视他们星期五她出去的时候我在她房间里发现了吊袜带，这对我来说已经足够了，有点太多了，当我给她提前几周通知时，她的脸因脾气而肿胀，我认为最好不要把吊袜带完全清理房间我自己更快只是为了该死的做饭和扔掉泥土我给了他无论如何要么她或我离开房子我什至不能碰他如果我认为他带着一个dir我是个赤裸裸的骗子，不修边幅，当着我的面否认这一点，还唱着厕所里的那个地方，因为她知道她过得很好，是的，因为他不可能没有它那么久，所以他必须在某个地方做这件事，最后一次他什么时候来到我屁股上的那个晚上，博伊兰用力挤压我的手，沿着我手里的托尔卡，那里偷了另一个我只是用我的拇指按着他的背，然后挤压回来，唱着年轻的五月月亮，她是笑容满面的爱，因为他对他和我有想法，他不是那么傻瓜，他说我出去吃饭，去欢乐场所，尽管无论如何我都不会让他满意，上帝知道他的改变并不总是如此总是戴着同样的旧帽子，除非我付钱给一个漂亮的男孩来做，因为我自己做不到，一个小男孩会喜欢我，如果我们是的话，我会让他和他单独混淆，我会让他看到我的吊袜带是新的，然后让他看到我的吊袜带。他看着他脸红了 勾引他 我知道男孩们的感觉是什么 脸颊上有那个东西 做那个该死的 按小时画出东西 问题和答案 你会这样做吗 那个 和另一个 与煤工 是的，与主教 是的，我愿意因为我告诉他，当我在犹太寺庙花园里编织那件羊毛制品时，一位院长或主教坐在我旁边，这对都柏林来说是个陌生人，那是什么地方，等等有关纪念碑的事情，他用雕像鼓励他制作他的雕像，让我疲惫不堪比他更糟糕的是，你现在在想谁，告诉我，你在想谁，告诉我他的名字，谁告诉我，德国皇帝是谁，是的，想象一下，我在想他，你能感觉到他在试图做一个妓女吗？我觉得他永远不会做的事，他现在应该在这个年纪放弃它，这对任何女人来说都是毁灭，而且没有任何满足感它假装喜欢它，直到他来，然后我自己完成它，无论如何，它让你的嘴唇苍白，它现在一劳永逸地完成了，全世界都在谈论它，人们使它只是第一次，之后它只是普通的去做，不再想它为什么你不能亲吻一个男人而不先和他结婚你有时喜欢疯狂当你感觉这样很好你无法控制自己我希望某个男人或其他人能带我去当他在那儿，在他的怀里吻我时，没有什么比一个漫长而炽热的吻深入你的灵魂，几乎让你瘫痪了，那么我讨厌那个忏悔，当我过去去找科里根神父时，他触碰了我，父亲，如果他在哪里做了什么伤害，我像个傻瓜一样在运河岸上说，但在你身上我的孩子在高高的后面的腿上说是的，是的，相当高，是你坐下的地方是的主啊，他不能说从底部出来并已经做了什么吗？不管他怎么说，你都做了我忘记了没有父亲，我总是想起真正的父亲，当我已经向上帝坦白时，他想知道什么，他有一只漂亮的胖手，手掌总是湿润的我不介意感觉它，他也不会，我会通过他的马项圈说，我想知道他在盒子里认识我吗？我可以看到他的脸，他看不到我的脸，当然他永远不会转身或表现出来，当他父亲去世时，他的眼睛是红色的对于一个女人来说，她们失去了，当然，当一个男人哭泣时一定很可怕，更不用说她们了，我希望被一个穿着法衣的人拥抱，他身上散发着熏香的味道，就像教皇一样，此外，如果你结婚了，牧师没有危险，他太小心了关于他自己然后给教皇一些东西作为忏悔我想知道他对我满意吗我不喜欢他的耳光虽然我笑了，但他还是很熟悉地跟在我后面走开，我不是一匹马，也不是一头驴，我想他是在想他的父亲，我想知道他是醒着想我还是在做梦，我在里面，是谁给了他他说的那朵花？他买了他闻到某种饮料的味道，不是威士忌或烈性黑啤酒，也不是他们用利口酒贴在账单上的那种甜糊糊，我想喝那些看起来很丰富的绿色和黄色昂贵的饮料，那些舞台门约翰尼斯用我尝过的歌剧帽子喝的当我的手指从那个有松鼠与父亲说话的邮票的美国人身上浸出时，他竭尽全力防止自己在上次我们拿了波特酒和盆栽肉之后睡着了，它有一种很好的咸味，是的，因为我觉得我自己很可爱，也很累，当我直接跳上床的那一刻，就睡得很香，直到雷声把我吵醒，上帝怜悯我们，当我祝福自己并说一声“万岁”时，我以为上天会在我们身边降临来惩罚我们。玛丽喜欢直布罗陀那些可怕的雷电，仿佛世界末日即将来临，然后它们来告诉你，没有上帝，如果它在奔跑和奔波，你能做什么，只是对那天晚上我点燃的蜡烛做出忏悔的行为五月份在Whitefriars街的教堂里看到它带来了好运，尽管他如果听到的话会嘲笑他，因为他从不去教堂弥撒或开会，他说你的灵魂，你没有灵魂，只有灰质，因为他不知道拥有什么。是的，当我点灯的时候，因为他一定带着那个巨大的红色野兽来了三四次，我以为静脉或他们所说的狄更斯会爆裂，尽管他的鼻子没那么大了下班后我脱掉了所有东西，拉上了百叶窗他穿衣服、喷香水、梳理它，就像熨斗或某种粗撬棍一样，一直站着，他一定吃过牡蛎，我想他有几十个，他的歌声很好，不，我一生中从来没有觉得有人有这么大的牡蛎。为了让你感到饱足，他一定是吃了一整只羊，到底是什么让我们像中间有一个大洞，或者像一匹种马把它撞到你身上，因为这就是他们想要从你身上得到的一切他眼神中充满了坚决的恶毒表情，我不得不半闭上眼睛，但当我让他拉出来并对我做这件事时，他还没有那么大的勇气，考虑到它有多大，万一没有洗干净，那就更好了上次我让他在我身上完成它时，他们为女人创造了一个很好的发明，让他获得所有的快乐，但如果有人亲自给他们一点机会，他们就会知道我和米莉经历了什么，没有人会相信也会割掉她的牙齿米娜·普尔弗伊的丈夫给我们挥舞着你的胡须，每年一次，像时钟一样定期给她生一个孩子或双胞胎，她身上总是带着孩子的气味，他们称之为虎皮鹦鹉或类似黑鬼的东西，带着震惊的感觉。头发上的耶稣杰克，孩子是黑人，上次我在那里的时候，他们一群人互相摔倒，嚎啕大哭，你听不到你的耳朵应该是健康的，除非他们让我们像大象一样肿胀，否则我不知道会发生什么。我冒着另一个不离开他的风险，但如果他结婚了，我确信他会有一个坚强的孩子，但我不知道波尔迪有更多的勇气，是的，那会非常快乐，我想是见到乔西·鲍威尔和葬礼，想着我博伊兰让他很开心，如果这对他有帮助的话，他现在可以想他喜欢的事情了我知道，当我来到乔治娜·辛普森乔迁之夜的那个场景时，他们正在跳舞，并和她一起坐在外面，然后他想把它塞到我的脖子上，因为不喜欢看到她成为壁花这就是为什么我们在政治问题上发生了站立争吵，是他开始的，不是我，当他说我们的主是一名木匠时，他最后让我哭了，当然，一个女人对一切都很敏感，我在为自己的屈服而感到愤怒之后我知道他对我很反感，他说的第一个社会主义者他让我很恼火，我无法让他发脾气，但他知道很多混乱的事情，特别是关于身体和内部的事情，我经常想自己研究一下当房间拥挤时，我总是能听到他的声音，然后看着他，我假装我对她对他很冷淡，因为每当他问你要去谁那里，我对弗洛伊说，他给了我拜伦的诗和三双手套作为礼物，这样我就可以很容易地让他随时弥补，我知道我什至假设他又和她在一起了，正要出去见她，我知道他是否拒绝吃洋葱，我知道有很多方法让他把我衬衫的领子卷起来，或者出去时用我的面纱和手套碰触他，我亲吻然后会让他们都旋转，但是好吧，我们看到然后让他去找她，她当然会很高兴假装她疯狂地爱着他，我不太介意我只是去找她问她你爱他吗直视她的眼睛，她骗不了我，但他可能会想象他能骗我，然后用他的口齿不清的样子向她做出声明。就像他对我做的那样，尽管我有自己的工作去摆脱他，尽管我喜欢他，因为这表明他可以坚持下去，并且不会因为他那天晚上也突然问我而受到要求在厨房里，我正在擀土豆饼，有件事我想对你说，只是因为我阻止了他，让他发脾气了，我的手和手臂都沾满了面粉，无论如何，我前一天晚上放得太多了谈论梦想，所以我不想让他知道更多对他有利的事情，每当他在场时，她总是拥抱我乔西，这意味着他当然对我大加赞赏，当我说我尽可能地上下冲洗时，问我和你洗了吗？女人们总是怂恿他，当他在场时，她们就知道，当他们拿出一些东西时，他狡猾的眼睛眨着，有点冷漠，他就是那种宠坏他的人，我不奇怪至少因为他当时非常英俊，试图看起来像拜伦勋爵，我说我喜欢，尽管他对于一个男人来说太漂亮了，而且在我们订婚之前他就已经有点了，尽管我那天她不太喜欢它一阵阵咯咯地笑起来，我无法阻止我所有的发夹随着我的头发纷纷脱落，你总是很幽​​默，她说是的，因为这让她很困惑，因为她知道这意味着什么，因为我曾经告诉过她我们之间发生的一些事情虽然不是全部，但足以让她流口水，但这不是我的错，我们结婚后她没有把门弄黑太多，我想知道她和她那个脾气暴躁的丈夫住在一起后现在怎么样了我上次见到她时，她的脸色开始显得憔悴、憔悴，她一定是刚和他吵完架，因为我看到就在那一刻，她正准备写一篇关于丈夫的谈话，谈论他，让他失望，她告诉我了什么，哦，是的，有时当蛆虫把他带走时，他常常穿着沾满泥的靴子上床睡觉，想象一下和这样的东西上床，随时可能杀了你，这不是每个人都会发疯的方式，波尔迪无论如何，无论他做什么，当他湿漉漉或亮着的时候，总是在垫子上擦脚，总是把脚涂黑。也穿着自己的靴子，当他像以前一样出现在街上时，他总是脱下帽子，现在他穿着拖鞋到处寻找 10000 英镑的明信片 哦，亲爱的，这样的事情不会让你感到无聊吗？到灭绝实际上太愚蠢了，甚至现在连脱掉靴子你能怎么看待这样的男人我宁愿死20次也不愿嫁给另一个同性当然他永远不会找到像我这样的另一个女人能像我一样忍受他你知道我，来和我一起睡吧，是的，他也知道，在他内心深处，梅布里克夫人毒害了她的丈夫，因为我想知道她爱上了另一个男人，是的，在她身上发现了，她不是彻头彻尾的恶棍吗？去做这样的事情当然，有些男人可能会非常恼人，让你发疯，而且总是世界上最糟糕的词，他们为什么要求我们嫁给他们，如果因为他们无法相处而变得如此糟糕，那么他们会要求我们嫁给他们吗？没有我们，她在他的茶里放了捕蝇纸，不是吗？我不知道为什么他们这么称呼它，如果我问他，他会说它来自希腊语，让我们像以前一样聪明，她一定是疯狂地爱上了另一个家伙冒着被绞死的机会哦，她不在乎这是否是她的本性，除了他们还没有足够的野蛮去走之外，她还能做什么？绞死一个女人肯定是他们

theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was l/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him l or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him 111 know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all 111 be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 5 o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the . smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Bums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were
他们都很不同，博伊兰在谈论我的脚的形状时，甚至在他被介绍之前，他就注意到了，当时我在 D B C，波尔迪笑着，试图听我摇晃着我的脚，我们都点了 2 杯茶、普通面包和黄油。当我站起来问那个女孩时，看到他和他的两个姐姐的老女仆一起看，我在乎它从我身上掉下来，而他让我买的那条黑色紧身马裤需要你半个小时才能把它们弄湿。我自己总是每隔一周就会推出一些全新的时尚，这么长的时间，我把我的绒面革手套忘在后面的座位上了，我在追捕一个女人的强盗后从未得到过，他想让我把它放在迷失在女士们中的爱尔兰时代厕所 D B C 达姆街发现者回到马里昂·布鲁姆夫人身边，我看到他的眼睛盯着我的脚，从转门出去，当我回头看时，他正在看，两天后我满怀希望地去那里喝茶，但他现在不在，那是怎么回事让他兴奋，因为当我们第一次在另一个房间时，我正在穿过它们，他的意思是，鞋子太紧了，我手里走路就很好，如果我只有一个月的宝石戒指，一块漂亮的海蓝宝石，我会粘住他为了一个和一个金手镯，我还是不太喜欢我的脚，在古德温演唱会搞砸后的那个晚上，我让他用我的脚度过了一次，天气又冷又风大，还好我们在房子里喝了朗姆酒，火也没有当他要求脱掉我躺在朗伯德街西的炉边地毯上的长袜时，我就昏过去了，还有一次，是我沾满泥的靴子，他喜欢我走在我能找到的所有马粪中，但当然，他不像其他人那样自然。世界上我他说什么我可以给凯蒂·兰纳 10 分中的 9 分并击败她这意味着什么我问他我忘了他什么了说因为停止印刷版刚刚过去，卢坎乳品厂里那个卷发的男人太有礼貌了，我想我以前在某个地方见过他的脸，当我品尝黄油时我注意到他，所以我也慢慢来，巴特尔·达西（Bartell dArcy）也曾经说过取笑当我唱完古诺的《万福玛利亚》后他开始在唱诗班楼梯上亲吻我时我们还在等什么啊我的心直接吻我的额头和部分，这是我的棕色部分，他的声音太性感了，我的他总是对低沉的音符赞不绝口，如果你相信他的话，我喜欢他用嘴唱歌的方式，然后他说在那样的地方这样做不是很可怕吗？我没看到有什么可怕的，我会告诉他一些不是现在，给他一个惊喜，是的，我会带他去那里，带他参观那个我们也做过的地方，所以现在你就喜欢它或搞砸它，他认为如果他不知道他对我母亲一无所知，直到我们在一起，什么都不会发生。订婚了，否则他永远不会像他那样便宜地得到我，无论如何，他自己比他更糟，恳求我给他一点点剪掉我的抽屉，那天晚上沿着凯尼尔沃斯广场他吻了我手套的眼睛，我不得不把它脱下来问我问题是否允许询问我卧室的形状，所以我让他保留它，就好像我忘记了它一样，当我看到他把它塞进口袋时，他就想起了我，当然，他对这个问题很生气显而易见，抽屉们总是在自行车上挤着那些厚颜无耻的东西，它们的裙子被吹到肚脐，即使当米莉和我和他一起在露天庆祝活动时，那个穿着奶油色平纹细布的人站在阳光下，所以他当他从后面看到我时，她可以看到她身上的每一个原子 在雨中跟随我在他看到我之前就看到了他 然而他站在哈罗德十字路口的拐角处，身上穿着一件新雨衣，围巾是辛加里颜色的，以展示他的肤色，戴着棕色帽子，看起来像往常一样狡猾，他在那里做什么，他们没有生意可去。无论他们喜欢什么，穿裙子的东西，都不会问任何问题，但他们想知道你在哪里，你要去哪里，我能感觉到他在我身后偷偷地走来，他的眼睛盯着我的脖子，他一直躲开从房子里出来，他觉得天气对他来说太热了，所以我半转过身，停了下来，然后他缠着我答应，直到我慢慢地脱下手套，看着他，他说我的镂空袖子太冷了，不适合下雨，任何借口都可以穿他的手在我的抽屉里度过了整个幸福的时光，直到我答应把我娃娃上的那副给他，放在他的背心口袋里随身携带哦玛丽亚·桑蒂西玛，他看起来确实是个大傻瓜，在雨中淋着，他那副漂亮的牙齿让我饿了看着他们，恳求我掀起我穿的带有阳光褶皱的橙色衬裙，他说没有人，如果我不坚持的话，他会跪在湿漉漉的地方，他也会的，毁掉他的新雨衣，你永远不知道什么怪胎他们会单独和你在一起，如果有人经过，他们会很野蛮，所以我把他们举起来，然后用我的无名手在外面碰触他的裤子，就像我过去对加德纳那样，以免他在太公开的地方做更糟糕的事，我快死了得知他是否受过割礼后，他浑身发抖，像果冻一样，他们想要做的太快，失去所有的乐趣，父亲一直在等待他的晚餐，他让我说我把钱包落在了肉店里，不得不回去，真是个骗子，然后他给我写了那封信，上面写着所有这些里面的话他怎么能有脸面对任何女人，因为他的公司礼仪让我们见面后变得如此尴尬，在我们见面后问我我是否冒犯了你，我的眼皮垂下来，他当然看到了我，他有一些大脑，不像其他傻瓜亨尼·道尔（Henny Doyle）他总是在字谜游戏中打破或撕扯一些东西，我讨厌一个不幸的人，如果我知道这意味着什么，我当然不得不说不，出于形式原因，我不明白你，我说的是不是很自然，所以它当然是使用的在直布罗陀的墙上写着一张女人的照片，上面写着这个词，我在任何地方都找不到，只有孩子们才看到它，太年轻了，然后每天早上写一封信，有时一天两次，我喜欢他做爱的方式，然后他知道了当他送给我八朵大罂粟花时，我对一个女人的态度是这样的，因为我的是第八朵，然后我写了他在海豚谷仓亲吻我的心的那个晚上，我无法简单地描述它，它让你感觉自己在地球上什么都不是，但他从来不知道如何拥抱就像加德纳一样，我希望他周一来，正如他同时说的那样，四我讨厌那些全天候来应门的人，你认为是蔬菜，然后是某人，而你们都脱了衣服，或者肮脏邋遢的厨房的门被吹开了那天，老霜脸古德温打电话来谈论朗伯德街的音乐会，我刚吃完晚饭，就满脸通红，全身都是滚烫的老炖菜，别看我，教授，我不得不说，我很害怕，是的，但他是一个真正的老绅士，以他的方式不可能更尊重别人，没有人说你出去了，你必须像今天的送信员一样从百叶窗里往外看，我认为这是一个拖延，他先送了波特酒和桃子，我刚刚开始紧张地打呵欠，以为他在尝试当我知道他在门口的时候他一定是在嘲笑我我有点晚了，因为当我看到两个 Dedalus 女孩从学校回来时，已经是 3 点钟了，我不知道时间，甚至他给我的那块手表似乎也走不准，当我扔掉手表时，我想把它照顾好。当我吹口哨时，给那个英格兰家乡和美丽的蹩脚水手一分钱，有一个我爱的迷人女孩，我什至没有穿上干净的衣服或给自己扑粉或其他事情，然后这一天一周要去贝尔法斯特，就像他一样27 号去恩尼斯参加他父亲的周年纪念日，如果他认为我们酒店的房间是相邻的，并且在新床上进行任何愚弄，我就不能告诉他停下来，不要在下一次打扰我。房间里，或者也许是某个新教牧师咳嗽着敲墙，然后他永远不会相信第二天我们没有做某事，这一切都很好，一个丈夫，但在我告诉他我们从未做过任何事情之后，你不能欺骗情人，当然他不相信我不，最好他去他现在所在的地方，除了他总是会发生一些事情，去玛丽伯勒的马洛音乐会的时候，为我们两个人点了煮汤，然后铃声响了，他走下站台，汤溅得满地都是，他舀了几勺汤他没有勇气，他后面的服务员给我们做了一场神圣的表演，尖叫着，混乱地等待引擎启动，但他直到完成才付钱，三等车厢的两位先生说他是对的，所以他太他了有时当他脑子里有事情时，他会很顽固，干得好，他能用刀打开车厢门，否则他们会带我们去科克，我想那是出于对他的报复，哦，我喜欢在火车或火车上闲逛。车里有可爱的软垫，我想知道他会为我坐一等舱吗？哦，我想，一定会有一些普通的白痴，用他们的眼睛目瞪口呆地看着我们，他们可能是这样的，那是一个非凡的人，那天把我们单独留在车厢里的那个普通工人到霍斯 我想了解一些关于他的事情 大概有 1 或 2 条隧道 然后你必须更好地看着窗外 然后回来 假设我再也没有回来 他们会怎么说 与他私奔 让你登上舞台我上一次演唱会是在一年多以前，那是圣特雷莎音乐厅，克拉伦登圣，小姐们的小短文，他们现在唱凯瑟琳·卡尼和她这样的人，因为父亲在军队，而我唱着心不在焉的乞丐，戴着胸针对于罗伯茨勋爵来说，当我掌握了这一切的地图时，波尔迪还不够爱尔兰语，这次是他成功了吗？我让他听音乐，直到耶稣会士们发现他是一个共济会成员，他在敲击钢琴，你是从一些老歌剧中抄袭来的，是的，他最近和他们中的一些人在一起，比如辛纳芬党，或者他们自称的任何人，谈论他平常的事情垃圾和废话，他说他给我看的那个没有脖子的小人非常聪明，即将到来的格里菲思是他，他看起来不像，这就是我能说的，但一定是他，他知道有一场抵制活动，我讨厌提及战后他们的政治，比勒陀利亚、莱迪史密斯和布隆方丹，加德纳中尉斯坦利·G第8营第2东兰克军团肠热病他是一个穿着卡其布的可爱小伙子，身高比我刚刚好我相信他也很勇敢他说我很可爱那天晚上我们在运河闸口吻别爱尔兰美女，他因兴奋而脸色苍白，因为要离开或我们会从路上被人看见，他无法正常站立，我太热了，因为我从来没有觉得他们可以在一开始就和平相处，或者老保罗和其他老克鲁格人去他们之间决一死战，而不是拖了好几年，杀死那些发烧的帅哥，如果他被像样地枪杀，那也不会那么糟糕，我喜欢看到一个团在我第一次看到西班牙人时通过审查从阿尔赫西拉斯眺望海湾对面的拉罗克骑兵，真是太可爱了，岩石上的所有灯光都像萤火虫一样，或者在15英亩的土地上进行的假战斗，黑色守望者穿着短裙及时行进，经过威尔士亲王拥有的第10骠骑兵团或者枪骑兵哦，枪骑兵，他们很伟大，或者赢得图盖拉的都柏林，他的父亲通过卖马为骑兵赚了钱，他可以在我给他之后在贝尔法斯特给我买一件漂亮的礼物，他们在那里有可爱的亚麻布，或者其中之一那些漂亮的和服东西我必须像以前一样买一个樟脑丸放在抽屉里和他一起去购物会很令人兴奋在一个新城市买这些东西最好把这个戒指留在后面想要继续转动并转动以获得它那里的指关节，或者他们可能会在他们的报纸上在镇上大喊大叫，或者告诉警察关于我的事，但他们认为我们已经结婚了哦，让他们都走吧，让他们自己窒息，我关心他有很多钱，而且他不是一个已婚的人伙计，如果我能知道他是否喜欢我，最好有人从他嘴里问出来。当然，当我近距离观察手镜时，我看上去有点湿漉漉的。给镜子上粉，除了总是像那样蹲下身子压着我之外，从来没有给过你这样的表情。他的髋骨很大，他的哈也很重胸口因为这种炎热而总是不得不躺下，对他们来说更好，对他来说，从后面把它放在我身上，就像马斯蒂安斯基夫人告诉我的那样，她的丈夫让她像狗一样，尽可能地伸出舌头，他就这样安静而温和，他的色调也很柔和，你能像男人那样对待他们吗？他穿着那套可爱的蓝色西装，领带和袜子，上面有天蓝色的丝质东西，他肯定很富裕，我从他的剪裁就知道衣服和他的厚手表，但在他回来后的几分钟里，他就像一个完美的魔鬼，撕毁了彩票并咒骂大火，因为他输了20英镑，他说他输给了那个赢了的局外人，他穿上了一半对我来说，是因为莱尼汉斯的小费，咒骂他到最低的坑里，在格伦克里晚餐后，他和我一起自由地吃食。在市长大人用他肮脏的眼睛看着我之后，他在羽毛山上颠簸了很长一段时间，瓦尔·狄龙，那个大异教徒我第一次注意到他是在吃甜点的时候，当时我正在用牙齿咬坚果，我真希望我能从手指上把那只鸡的每一口都吃掉，它是如此美味，呈棕色，和任何东西一样嫩，只是因为我不想吃掉所有东西。我的盘子里的那些叉子和切鱼片也都是银色的，我希望我有一些，当我玩它们的时候，我可以很容易地把几个塞进我的手筒里，然后总是在餐馆里挂着它们来赚钱，换取你放进喉咙里的那块东西。我们必须感谢我们那杯肮脏的茶本身，这是一种伟大的赞美，让我们注意到世界在任何情况下都是分裂的，如果它要继续下去，我至少想要两件其他好的衬衣，但我不知道他不喜欢什么样的抽屉 我想他不是说是的吗直布罗陀的女孩们从不赤身裸体地穿它们，因为上帝创造了她们，安达卢西亚人唱着她的马诺拉，她并没有对她没有的东西保密太多，是的，第二双丝袜在穿了一天后就被梯子拉起来了，我本可以把它们带回Lewers早上，大吵了一架，让一个人换了它们，只是为了不让自己心烦意乱，冒着走进他的风险，毁掉整个事情，我想要一件儿童紧身胸衣，在臀部有弹性戈尔的绅士上做廉价广告，他保存了我的那个，但那不好，他们说了什么，他们给出了令人愉快的身材线条 11/6，消除了下背部难看的宽阔外观，以减少肉，我的肚子有点太大了，我必须在晚餐时去掉黑啤酒或者我太喜欢它了，他们从奥鲁克斯寄来的最后一个东西像煎饼一样扁平，他让他的钱很容易拉里，他们称他为旧的肮脏包裹，他在圣诞节寄了一个乡村蛋糕和一瓶他试图假冒的潦水作为红葡萄酒，他不能让任何人喝上帝保佑他的口水，因为担心他会因口渴而死，否则我必须做一些呼吸练习我想知道抗脂肪剂是否有任何好处可能会过度，薄的现在不太流行吊袜带我有今天穿的那双紫罗兰色的那双，那是他用第一张支票给我买的所有东西哦，不，我昨天最后用完的洗面奶让我的皮肤像新的一样，我一遍又一遍地告诉他，得到是在同一个地方配制的，别忘了，天知道他是否这么做了，毕竟我对他说过了。 111 无论如何，通过瓶子知道，如果不是的话，我想 111 只需要在我的小便中洗一下，就像牛肉茶或鸡汤一样，加一些抗药膏和紫罗兰色，我觉得皮肤下面开始看起来粗糙或老了一点下面要好得多，烧伤后它在我的手指上剥落了，可惜它不是那样的，还有四块微不足道的手帕，大约6/总之，如果没有风格，你就无法在这个世界上生活，所有的一切都在食物和租金中我明白了 我会鞭打它 我用精致的方式告诉你 我总是想把一把茶扔进壶里 测量和切碎 如果我买一双旧布洛克鞋 你喜欢那些新鞋 是的 多少钱 我没有棕色服装、裙子和夹克以及清洁工的衣服 3 对于任何一个剪掉这顶旧帽子并修补另一顶帽子的女人来说，男人不会看你，女人会试图在你身上行走，因为他们知道你已经那么，在我 35 岁之前的 4 年里，所有的东西每天都在变得越来越贵，不，我到底是什么 111，九月就 33 了，我会怎样呢？哦，看看加尔布雷斯夫人，她比我大得多上周我出去的时候我看到了她，她的美貌正在衰退，她是一个可爱的女人，一头美丽的头发垂到腰间，像格兰瑟姆街的凯蒂·奥谢一样，我每天早上做的第一件事就是看向对面她梳着它，好像她很喜欢它，而且充满了怜悯，可惜我在我们离开的前一天才认识她，威尔士王子爱上了泽西百合兰特里夫人，我想他就像第一个上路的人只为了国王的名义，他们都是以一种方式制作的，只有黑人我想尝试一个45岁以下的美女，有一个关于嫉妒的老丈夫的有趣故事，这到底是什么，他走了一把牡蛎刀不，他让她在她和威尔士王子的周围戴上一种锡制的东西，是的，他有牡蛎刀，不可能是真的，就像他给我带来的一些书一样 弗朗索瓦大师 有人应该是一名牧师，关于她耳朵里生的孩子，因为她的屁股说出了任何牧师都可以写的好词，而她的a-e好像任何傻瓜都不会知道这意味着什么我讨厌假装一切带着那张老流氓的脸，任何人都可以看出这不是真的，他给我带来了两次《红宝石和美丽的暴君》，我记得当我读到第5页时，关于她用鞭毛绳把他挂在钩子上的部分对于一个女人来说，所有的发明都是关于他在舞会结束后从她的拖鞋里喝香槟，就像婴儿耶稣在 Inchicore 的婴儿床上，在圣母玛利亚的怀里一样，肯定没有女人能生出这么大的孩子我想，首先它是从她身边发出的，因为她怎么能在她想去的时候去房间，而且她是一位富有的女士，当然她感到很荣幸，我出生那年他在直布罗陀，我打赌他在那里找到了百合花他在哪里种了那棵树，他在他那个时代种的树比他种的还要多，如果他早点来的话，他可能也会种下我，那么我就不会像现在这样了，他应该用他从树上敲下来的微不足道的几先令扔掉那个弗里曼。走进办公室或其他他能定期领薪水的地方，或者去银行，他们可以把他放在王座上，整天数钱，当然他更喜欢密谋房子的事情，所以你不能和他搅在一起，你的计划是什么今天我希望他能像父亲一样抽一根烟斗。男人的味道，或者假装在闲逛广告，而他本来可以留在库夫斯先生，只是因为他所做的事情，然后派我去尝试修补它，我可以让他在那里晋升为经理，他给了我一个伟大的米拉达，先有一两次，他和那个恶作剧一样僵硬，真的，真正的布鲁姆夫人，只是我觉得那件旧垃圾衣服很烂，我把尾巴上的领子掉了，没有剪掉，但它们又开始流行了，我买了只是为了取悦他，我知道到最后没什么好处，可惜我改变了主意，去了托德和流浪汉，就像我说的那样，而不是李斯，就像商店本身一样，翻箱倒柜出售很多垃圾，我讨厌那些有钱的商店得到的东西在你的神经上，没有什么能完全杀死我，只是他认为他对女人的着装和烹饪了解很多，他把所有他能从架子上搜出来的东西都放进去，如果我听从他的建议，我戴上的每一顶神圣的帽子是否适合我，是的，接受那个没关系，他说那个像婚礼蛋糕一样立在离我头几英里远的地方适合我，或者是那个盖在我屁股上的，关于格拉夫顿街那个地方的女店员的事，我很不幸把他带进去了，她就像她一如既往地无礼，傻笑着说，我担心给你带来太多麻烦，她在那儿做什么，但我从她身上看出了这一点，是的，他非常僵硬，这也难怪，但第二次他看起来波尔迪像往常一样固执时，他就变了汤，但当他站起来为我开门时，我可以看到他非常认真地看着我的胸部，无论如何，他很好地带我出去了，我非常抱歉，布卢姆夫人相信我，第一次没有做得太明显在他被侮辱而我被认为是他的妻子之后我只是半笑我知道我的胸部当他在门口说“我非常抱歉并且我确信你是”时

是的，我想他让它们变得更硬了，像那样吸吮它们这么久，他让我口渴了，他称之为它们，我不得不笑，是的，这个乳头无论如何都会变得坚硬，我会让他继续这样，我会接受那些用玛莎拉酱打碎的鸡蛋为他增肥了，这些静脉和东西是什么，它们的制作方式很奇怪，2个相同，如果是双胞胎，它们应该代表美丽，就像博物馆里的那些雕像一样，其中一个假装隐藏它当然，与她的手相比，它们是如此美丽，与一个男人的样子相比，他的两个袋子装满了，而他的其他东西挂在他身上，或者像帽子一样向你伸出，难怪他们用卷心菜隐藏它，恶心的卡梅伦高地人在肉类市场后面，或者在树后面那个红头的坏人的后面，当我路过的时候，鱼的雕像曾经在那里，假装他正在撒尿，站在外面让我看到它，他的婴儿服在女王拥有的一侧很好，萨里一家让他们松了口气，每次我几乎经过哈考特街车站附近的男士温室外面时，他们总是试图向你展示这一点，只是为了尝试一些人或其他人试图吸引我的目光，就好像这是我的一样世界七大奇迹 哦，那些腐烂地方的臭味，科默福德派对结束后与波尔迪一起回家的那天晚上，橙子和柠檬水让你感觉很好，水汪汪的，我走进了其中的一个，那里太冷了，我无法保留它93 运河结冰了 是的，几个月后，遗憾的是，卡梅伦夫妇没有看到我蹲在梅德罗男士广场上，在我把它撕成香肠之类的东西之前，我试图画一张它的照片我想知道他们不怕被踢或被打那里的女人很漂亮，当然，当他说我可以在霍利斯街的某个富翁面前摆出裸体姿势拍照时，他在Helys失业了，而我正在卖衣服，在咖啡厅里闲逛，我当然承认这一点，我会吗？就像那只头发垂下来的仙女洗澡一样，是的，只是她更年轻，或者我有点像西班牙照片中那个肮脏的母狗，他让仙女用过，她们就这样走来走去，我向他询问了她的情况，这个词遇到了一些带有软管的东西他提出了一些关于转世的令人震惊的内容，他永远无法用身体可以理解的方式简单地解释一件事，然后他去把锅底烧掉，一切都是为了他的肾，这不是那么多，还有他的牙齿印记当他试图咬乳头的时候，我不得不尖叫出来，他们不是害怕伤害你吗？我和米莉的母乳足够两个人吃，他说我每周可以吃一磅作为湿的原因是什么？早上，那个看起来很精致的学生，停在 28 号香橼彭罗斯，差点撞见我透过窗户洗衣服，只是因为我把毛巾拉到脸上，那是他的学生，伤害了我，他们过去常给她断奶，直到他得到为止。布雷迪医生给了我颠茄处方，我必须让他吸吮它们，它们太硬了，他说它比奶牛更甜更浓，然后他想把我挤进茶里，他超出了我所说的有人应该把他放进去的一切如果我能记住一半的事情并用它写一本书，波尔迪大师的作品，是的，他的皮肤光滑得多，他在这些作品上待了一个小时，我确信时钟就像某种我生下了一个大婴儿，他们想要把所有的东西都放进嘴里，所有那些男人得到的快乐我能感觉到他的嘴，主啊，我必须伸展自己，我希望他在这里，或者有人让我自己一起走，然后像那样再来，我感觉我内心充满火焰，或者如果我能梦想到他让我度过这一切第二次用他的手指在我背后挠痒痒，我用腿绕着他来了大约 5 分钟，之后我不得不拥抱他，主啊，我想喊出各种各样的东西，他妈的或拉屎的或任何东西，只是为了不显得丑陋或那些来自压力的台词谁知道他会采取什么方式你想和一个男人一起感受你的方式他们并不都像他感谢上帝他们中的一些人希望你对此如此友善我注意到他这样做而不说话的对比我我的眼睛看起来因为翻滚而有点松散，我的舌头放在嘴唇之间，向他这个野蛮的畜生星期四星期五一个星期六两个星期天三主啊我等不及星期一了

down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull

whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of

the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account

drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand

火车在某个地方呼啸而过，那些引擎的力量就像巨大的巨人一样，水从四面八方滚滚而出，就像《爱老甜心》的结尾一样，那些可怜的男人必须整夜离开他们的妻子和家人。那些烘烤引擎今天令人窒息，我很高兴我烧掉了一半的旧弗里曼和照片碎片，留下了这样的东西，他变得非常粗心，把剩下的扔进了W C 111，让他明天帮我切割它们让他们明年在那里为他们赚几便士让他问去年一月的报纸和所有那些我从大厅捆绑出来的旧大衣在哪里，使这个地方比现在更热，在我美丽之后，雨是可爱的，令人耳目一新睡觉，我以为它会变得像直布罗陀，我的天啊，在黎凡特到来之前那里的炎热像夜晚一样黑，岩石像一个大巨人一样矗立在其中，与他们认为与他们认为如此伟大的三座岩石山相比，岩石的眩光到处都是红色的哨兵，白杨树，它们都白热化了，那些水箱里雨水的味道，看着太阳一直照在你身上，褪色了，父亲的朋友斯坦霍普夫人从巴黎马尔凯寄给我的那件可爱的连衣裙，真可惜，我的最亲爱的Doggerina，她在上面写道，她非常好，这是什么，她的另一个名字只是一台电脑，告诉你我送了一份小礼物，刚刚洗了个愉快的热水澡，感觉一只非常干净的狗现在很喜欢它，wogger，她叫他wogger，wd 给任何东西回到吉布，听你唱歌等待，在老马德里Concone是那些练习的名字，他给我买了其中一个新的单词，我听不懂披肩有趣的东西，但为最不重要的东西而流泪，仍然在那里可爱我想你一定会想起我们一起喝的可爱的茶、美味的醋栗烤饼和覆盆子威化饼，我现在很喜欢，亲爱的多格丽娜，请务必尽快写信，她没有向你的父亲问好，也没有向格罗夫船长致意，也爱你，海丝特 x x x x x 她看起来不像他像个女孩一样结婚了，他比她的沃格大几岁，他非常喜欢我，当他在拉利尼亚斗牛场用脚踩住铁丝让我跨过去时，当斗牛士戈麦斯被赋予公牛耳朵时，这些衣服我们必须穿着发明它们的人，希望你走上基利尼山，然后例如在野餐时，大家都熬夜，你不能在人群中奔跑或跳开，这就是为什么当其他凶猛的人时我感到害怕老公牛开始用腰带和帽子里的两件东西向旗手们发起冲锋，还有那些喊着“勇敢的托罗”的野蛮人，当然，穿着漂亮的白色头巾的女人们也同样糟糕，把那些我从未听说过的可怜的马的所有内脏都撕了出来。我一生中就发生过这样的事，是的，他常常因为我把在贝尔巷狂吠的狗带走而心碎，可怜的畜生，他们的遭遇令人恶心，我想他们很久以前就死了，他们两个就像在迷雾中一样让你感觉很老了否则如何用一只手在一根线上打一个结，我们就像表兄弟一样，我多大了，然后暴风雨的夜晚，我睡在她的床上，她用手臂搂着我，然后我们早上用枕头打架，多有趣每当他有机会在阿拉米达滨海艺术中心的乐队表演时，他都会看着我当我和父亲以及格罗夫船长在一起时，我先抬头看了看教堂，然后看了看窗户，然后低下头，我们的目光相遇了，我感觉有什么东西穿过我，就像所有的针一样，我的眼睛在跳舞，我记得当我看着镜子里的自己时我几乎没有意识到他对女孩的吸引力的变化，尽管他有点秃头，聪明，看起来失望和快乐，同时他就像阿什利迪亚特阴影下的托马斯，我有来自阳光的灿烂皮肤和兴奋就像玫瑰 我没有眨眼入睡，因为她本来就不太好，但我本可以及时停止，她给了我月光石让我读那是我第一次读到威尔基·柯林斯东林恩我读到了阿什利迪亚特的影子亨利·伍德·亨利·邓巴夫人是我后来借给他的另一个女人，里面有穆尔维的照片，这样他就知道我不是没有，利顿·尤金·阿拉姆·莫莉勋爵是她给我的亨格福德夫人的，因为我不喜欢带有莫莉的书这个名字他给我带来了来自佛兰德斯的那件，一个妓女总是在商店里偷窃任何她能找到的衣服和东西，还有好几码的东西哦，这条毯子对我来说太重了，那更好了，我什至没有一件像样的睡衣，这东西都卷在我下面了除了他和他的愚弄，那更好了，当时我在炎热的天气里浑身湿透，当我站起来时，我的衬衣被汗水粘在椅子上的屁股上，当我在沙发垫上站起来时，它们是如此肥胖和坚实穿上衣服，晚上看到大量的虫子，还有蚊帐，我根本看不懂一行字主啊，好像是很久以前的事了，当然他们再也没有回来过，而且她也没有把地址写在上面，她可能已经注意到了她的那些怪人总是离去，而我却从来不记得那天，海浪高高地摇晃着船，船上的气味让我晕船了，那些上岸的军官制服让我晕船，他什么也没说，他很认真，我穿着高筒靴子，裙子被风吹着，她吻了我哭过六七次了，不是吗？是的，我相信我哭过，或者快要哭了，当我说再见时，我的嘴唇都在颤抖，她身上裹着一件华丽的、特殊的蓝色包裹，为了这次航行，一侧非常特别，就像它一样。非常漂亮，他们走后，它变得像魔鬼一样沉闷，我几乎打算疯狂地逃跑，在某个地方从来都不容易，我们是父亲或阿姨或婚姻等待总是等待引导他太我等待也不加速他飞翔的脚步他们那该死的枪在商店里爆炸和隆隆作响，尤其是在女王生日那天，当尤利西斯·格兰特将军（无论他是谁或曾经被认为是一个伟大的家伙）从船上登陆时，如果你不打开窗户，所有的东西都会被扔到各个方向。洪水发生前就在那里的执政官给穷人穿上了衣服，他在为儿子哀悼，然后早上起床时吹着同样的旧号号，鼓声滚滚，不幸的可怜的士兵带着饭盒走来走去，闻到了这个地方比旧时更严重的气味。长胡子的犹太人穿着水母和利维人集会，声音清晰，枪声四起，让人们越过防线，典狱长拿着钥匙行进，锁上大门和风笛，只有格罗夫斯船长和父亲在谈论罗克斯漂流、普列夫纳和加内特·沃尔斯利爵士每次他们出去的时候，喀土穆的戈登都会为他们点燃烟斗，醉酒的老魔鬼，窗台上放着烈酒，抓住他留下的任何东西，他挖鼻孔试图想出一些东西另一个肮脏的故事可以在角落里讲，但当我在那儿时，他永远不会忘记自己，因为一些盲目的借口，送我离开房间，向他致意，布什米尔斯威士忌当然在说话，但他会对下一个出现的女人做同样的事情。假设他很久以前就因酗酒而死了，那些日子就像很多年一样，不是一封来自活生生的灵魂的信，除了我寄给自己的零星几封信，里面还夹着纸片，太无聊了，有时我可以用指甲打架，听那个老阿拉伯人用那封信说话。眼睛和他那乐器般的家伙唱着他的嘿嘿嘿，我对你这个杂乱无章的家伙的所有赞美就像现在一样糟糕，双手垂在我身上，我看着窗外，如果有一个好人，即使在对面的房子里，医疗中心当我在窗口戴上手套和帽子以表明我要出去时，护士正在追赶霍尔斯街，这不是我的意思，他们不是很厚，永远听不懂你说的话，即使你想把它打印在一张大海报上给他们即使你用左手握手两次，他也认不出我，当我在韦斯特兰排教堂外对他皱起眉头时，他们伟大的智慧从何而来，我想知道灰质，如果你问我那些，他们的尾巴里就有这些城市武器情报局里的乡村诈骗者，他们看到的景象比他们卖肉的公牛和母牛还要少，还有煤工的铃声，那个吵闹的家伙试图用错误的钞票欺骗我，他从帽子里拿出了一双多么好的爪子今天有锅碗瓢盆和水壶来为一个穷人修补破烂的瓶子，除了他的支票或像他们寄给他的神奇工人这样的广告之外，没有访客或邮件，亲爱的女士，只有他的信和米莉今天早上寄来的卡片，看她写的给他的一封信我收到了谁的信德温夫人的最后一封信现在是什么让她在这么多年后才从加拿大写来的，因为她写信说她嫁给了一位非常富有的建筑师，如果我相信我所听到的一切的话，她知道我的马德里皮斯托·弗洛伊·狄龙的配方。她的父亲有一座别墅，有八个房间，是个非常好的人，他快七十了，总是脾气很好，现在特威迪小姐或吉莱斯皮小姐有一个小便器，是纯银咖啡具，他也在桃花心木餐具柜上放过，然后死在那么远的地方，我讨厌那些总是向每个人讲述自己可怜的故事的人都有自己的麻烦，可怜的南希·布莱克一个月前死于急性肺炎，我不太了解她，因为她是弗洛伊的朋友，而不是我的朋友，可怜的南希，不得不回答很麻烦他总是告诉我错误的事情，不停地说，比如发表演讲，表达你悲伤的丧亲之痛，我总是犯这样的错误，新侄子有两个双倍的你，我希望下次如果他真的喜欢的话，他会给我写一封更长的信我哦，感谢伟大的上帝，我有人给了我我非常想要的东西，给了我一些心，你在这个地方根本没有机会，就像你很久以前使用的那样，我希望有人能给我写一封情书，他不多，我告诉他他可以写他喜欢你的休·博伊兰在旧马德里的东西愚蠢的女人相信爱情是叹息如果他写了我仍然会死我想这里面有一些真相是真是假它填满了你的一整天和生活每时每刻总有一些事情值得思考，在你周围看到它就像一个新世界我可以在床上写下答案让他想象我简短的几个字而不是那些长长的交叉字母阿蒂·狄龙过去常写给那个家伙在离开拉迪后被抛弃的四个法庭当我让她说几句简单的话时，他可以扭转他的写信方式，不以同等坦率的态度行事，是尘世间最大的幸福，肯定地回答一位绅士的求婚，我的天哪，没有别的了，这对他们来说都很好，但作为因为一旦你老了就成为女人，他们还不如把你扔进灰坑底部。

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a loo her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called

killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it

Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that

那天早上我上床睡觉时，穆尔韦斯是第一个进来的，鲁比奥夫人把它和咖啡一起送了进来，当我请她把我递给我时，她站在那里，我指着它们，我想不出用“发夹”这个词来用“ah horquilla”打开它。令人不齿的老东西，它盯着她的脸，她戴着一缕假发，对自己的外表感到自负，她已经快八十了，或者上厕所了，她的脸上有一大堆皱纹，她所有的宗教信仰都是专横的，因为她永远无法克服大西洋舰队乘着世界上一半的船只而来，英国国旗带着她所有的卡宾枪飞翔，因为四个醉酒的英国水手从他们身上拿走了所有的岩石，因为我在圣玛丽亚没有经常遇到弥撒，无法用她的披肩取悦她她除了在复活节周日早上举行婚礼时，她的所有圣徒奇迹和她的黑色受祝福的处女穿着银色的裙子和太阳跳舞3次，以及当神父敲响钟声将梵蒂冈带给垂死的人时为他的 Majestad 祝福自己，一个仰慕者，他签了字，我差点惊魂未定，当我看到他在商店橱窗里沿着皇家街跟着我时，我想去接他，然后他顺便给了我小费，但我从没想过他会写信预约时，我把它放在我的衬裙紧身胸衣里，一整天都在阅读它的每个孔和角落，而父亲则在操场上指导我通过笔迹或邮票歌唱的语言来找出答案，我记得我应该戴一朵白玫瑰吗？我想把那个愚蠢的老钟挂到快要到的时候，他是第一个在摩尔墙下亲吻我的人，我的甜心，当我还是个男孩的时候，我从来没有想到接吻意味着什么，直到他把舌头放进我嘴里，他的嘴像年轻时一样甜蜜，我把我的膝盖放在他身上几次我告诉他我是为了好玩才和一位名叫唐·米格尔·德拉弗洛拉的西班牙贵族的儿子订婚的，他相信我三年后就会嫁给他，这里面有很多真实的话。开玩笑，有一朵花会盛开，我告诉了他一些关于我自己的真实情况，只是为了让他想象他不喜欢的西班牙女孩，我想其中一个不会拥有他，我让他很兴奋，他压碎了他带来的我怀里的所有花我他不会数比塞塔和佩拉戈尔达，直到我教他卡波昆，他来自他在黑水上说，但时间太短了，在他离开的前一天五月是的，那是五月，西班牙婴儿国王出生了，我总是喜欢每年春天，我都喜欢在奥哈拉斯塔附近的岩石枪下的山顶上有一个新家伙，我告诉他那是被闪电击中的，还有他们送到克拉珀姆的老巴巴里猿，没有尾巴，在每场演出中都在狂奔。其他人回来卢比奥夫人说她是一个普通的老岩蝎子，从因斯农场抢鸡，如果你走近，就会向你扔石头，他正在看着我，我把那件白色衬衫敞开在前面，以鼓励他，就像我一样我说我累了，我们躺在冷杉树湾上，这是一个荒凉的地方，我想它一定是现存最高的岩石，画廊和炮台以及那些可怕的岩石和带有冰柱的圣迈克尔洞穴或者无论他们怎么称呼它们，它们挂在梯子上，所有的泥浆都弄脏了我的靴子，我确信这就是猴子死后在海底去非洲的路，船像碎片一样远去，那是马耳他的船，是的，大海和天空你可以做你喜欢做的事永远躺在那里他在外面爱抚他们因为那是圆形的 我戴着白色的稻草帽靠在他身上，以去除新鲜感 我的左脸是最好的 我的衬衫是他最后一天穿的透明衬衫 我可以看到他的胸部是粉红色的他想用他的触碰我的一会儿，但我不会离开他，他首先被吓坏了，因为担心你永远不知道肺结核或让我带着一个孩子尴尬，老仆人伊内斯告诉我，一滴即使它进入你体内在我尝试使用香蕉之后，但我担心它可能会破裂并迷失在我的某个地方，因为他们曾经从一个女人身上取下了一些东西，这个女人多年来一直被石灰盐覆盖，他们都疯狂地想要进入他们来的地方出于你的考虑，他们永远无法走得足够远，然后他们就以某种方式结束了你，直到下一次是的，因为那里有一种美妙的感觉，一直都很温柔，我们是如何结束的，是的，是的，我把他拉进了我的手帕假装不兴奋，但我张开了双腿，我不让他在我的衬裙里碰我，因为我有一条裙子，一侧打开，我先给他挠痒痒，然后把他折磨得死去活来，我喜欢在酒店里唤醒那只狗rrrsssstt awokwokawok他闭着眼睛，一只鸟在我们下面飞翔，尽管如此，他还是很害羞，我喜欢他的呻吟声，当我以这种方式克服他时，当我解开他的纽扣，把他的衣服拉出来，拉开它的皮肤时，我让他有点脸红。他们都是巴顿家族的人，在他们的另一边，莫莉，亲爱的，他叫我他叫什么名字，杰克·乔·哈利·穆尔维，是的，我认为是一名中尉，他相当公平，他有一种笑声所以我绕到你所说的一切都是你所说的胡子，如果他说他会回来，主啊就像昨天对我来说，如果我结婚了，他就会对我这么做，我向他保证，是的，忠实地我会让他阻止我现在飞行，也许他死了或被杀，或者是上尉或海军上将，如果我说冷杉湾，他会的，如果他走到我身后，用手捂住我的眼睛，猜猜我可能会认出他是谁，他还年轻，大约40岁，也许他在黑水边娶了某个女孩，而且变了很多，他们都没有女人所拥有的一半性格。我知道在她心爱的丈夫在光天化日之下梦见她之前我对她做了什么，在全世界的视野中你可能会说他们可以在编年史中发表一篇关于这件事的文章，当我炸毁了饼干装在贝纳迪兄弟的旧袋子里，然后爆炸了，上帝啊，一声巨响，所有的山鹬和鸽子尖叫着回来，就像我们穿过旧警卫室和犹太人墓地周围的中山一样，假装在上面读出希伯来语我想用他的手枪开火，他说他没有手枪，他不知道我戴着鸭舌帽，每当我把它摆正时，他总是戴歪了。 H M S 卡利普索挥舞着我的帽子，那个老主教在祭坛上说话，他的长篇大论地宣讲女性的更高功能，关于现在骑自行车、戴鸭舌帽的女孩和新的女性灯笼裤上帝赐予他理智和我更多的钱我想他们是以他的名字命名的我从来没有想过这会是我的名字布鲁姆当我写它的时候打印出来看看它在名片上的样子，或者为屠夫练习，并请M Bloom你看起来很盛开乔西在我嫁给他后常说，这比布林或布里格斯做的布里格或那些底部的可怕名字更好拉姆斯博顿夫人或其他某种底部 Mulvey 我 wo我不会因为其中任何一个而生气，或者假设我和他离婚了博伊兰夫人，我的母亲，无论她是谁，可能会给我一个更好的名字，上帝知道，在她给我取了一个可爱的名字之后，她有了露尼塔·拉雷多，我们沿着威利斯路跑到欧罗巴角，蜿蜒进进出出，很有趣在泽西岛的另一边，他们穿着我的衬衫摇晃跳舞，就像米莉的小孩子一样，现在当她跑上楼梯时，我喜欢低头看着他们，我在胡椒树和白杨树上跳起来，把叶子摘下来，把它们扔给他，他去了印度，他要写下那些男人必须进行到世界尽头的航行，然后回来，至少他们可能会在一个女人身上被挤压一两下，而他们可能会出去被淹死或被吹走那个星期天早上，我和船长卢比奥一起上了风车山，到了公寓，他是个像哨兵一样死气沉沉的望远镜，他说船上有一两个我穿着巴黎B Marche的那件连衣裙，戴着珊瑚项链，海峡闪闪发光我几乎可以看到摩洛哥的白色丹吉尔湾和白雪皑皑的阿特拉斯山，还有像一条河一样清澈的海峡哈利·莫莉亲爱的我在弥撒后一直在海上想着他，这时我的衬裙开始飘起来在海拔高的地方滑下来，几周又几周，我把手帕放在枕头下，闻他的气味，直布罗陀没有像样的香水，只有那种廉价的西班牙香水，它褪色了，在你身上留下了臭味，比我想要的任何东西都重要。为了给他留下纪念，他给了我那枚笨拙的克拉达戒指，以求好运，这是我送给加德纳去南非的，那里的布尔人用战争和发烧杀死了他，但他们还是被打败了，好像这带来了厄运一样蛋白石或珍珠仍然是纯净的 18 ca腐烂的金子，因为它很重，但是你能在这样的地方得到什么，来自非洲的沙蛙雨和那艘驶向港口的废弃船玛丽玛丽你怎么称呼它不，他没有加德纳的小胡子是的，我可以看到他的脸刮干净脸的Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong，再次训练哭泣的语气，在亲爱的逝去的日子里，在遥远的地方，闭上眼睛，呼吸，我的嘴唇，向前亲吻，悲伤的眼神，睁开钢琴，在世界上，迷雾开始，我讨厌istbeg来了，爱甜蜜，soooooooooooong，当我再次站在脚灯前 凯瑟琳·科尔尼和她那群尖叫者 小姐这个小姐那个小姐 另一个麻雀们到处乱跑谈论政治 他们和我的背后一样了解世界上任何让自己变得有趣的东西 爱尔兰自制美女 士兵的女儿我是吗？你们是谁？鞋匠和酒馆老板，请原谅，教练，我以为你们是一辆独轮车，如果他们有机会像我一样在乐队之夜，像我一样，在军官的手臂上沿着阿拉米达行走，他们就会死得精光。我的眼睛闪出我的半身像，他们没有激情，上帝帮助他们可怜的头脑，我年轻时对男人和生活的了解比他们50岁时都知道的还要多，他们不知道如何唱这样的歌加德纳说没有人可以看我的嘴和牙齿像这样微笑着，没有想到这一点，我担心他可能首先不喜欢我的口音，他那么英语，所有父亲都离开了我，尽管他有我的邮票，我有我母亲的眼睛和身材，无论如何，他总是说他们对自己很势利，他不是那些无赖。有点像他已经死了，在我嘴边让他们先找到一个合适的丈夫和一个像我这样的女儿，或者看看他们是否可以用可以挑选的金钱来刺激膨胀无论他想要像博伊兰那样做四五次，还是锁在彼此的怀里，或者声音，要么我本可以成为首席女歌手，但我嫁给了他，喜欢老深下巴后面，不要太多，让它加倍，我的女士鲍尔也是如此渴望再来一首关于黄昏时的护城河农庄和引以为豪的房间是的我会唱唱诗班表演后他唱的《从南方吹来的风》我会改变我黑色连衣裙上的蕾丝以炫耀我的小家伙我是的上帝我会得到的大粉丝修补得让他们羡慕不已，当我想起他时，我的洞总是痒痒的，我感觉我想要我感觉到我体内有风，最好放轻松，不要吵醒他，让他再次这样做，在洗完我自己的每一点后，流着口水如果我们有一个浴缸或者我自己的房间的话，我希望他能一个人睡在床上，双脚冰冷，给我们空间，甚至可以放个屁，上帝，或者做一点更好的事情，是的，像那样抱住他们轻轻地坐在我身边钢琴 sweeeee 还有那列远方的火车 极弱的eeeeee 又一首歌

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh place I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all IS at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at I S my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose 111 have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow 111 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore
无论你在哪里，让你的风自由自在，谁知道我喝茶后吃的那块猪排在炎热的天气里是否很好吃，我闻不到任何味道，我确信猪肉屠宰场里那个长相奇怪的男人是个大流氓我希望灯没有冒烟，让我的鼻子充满污物，这比让他整晚都开着煤气灯要好。我在直布罗陀的床上无法轻松休息，甚至起床看看为什么我对此如此紧张，尽管我喜欢它冬天更有陪伴啊主啊，那个冬天也很冷，当时我只有十岁左右，是的，我有一个大娃娃，里面有很多有趣的衣服，给她穿衣服和脱衣服，冰冷的风从那些山脉吹过，就像内华达山脉一样内华达站在火边，有一点点短暂的转变，我必须起身取暖，我喜欢在里面跳舞，然后跑回床上，我确信对面的那个人曾经一直在那里，关着灯看着夏天，我在我的皮肤上跳来跳去，我曾经爱自己，然后在盥洗台上脱光衣服，只在室内表演时涂抹奶油，我也关掉了灯，所以今晚我们两个人告别了我的睡眠不管怎样，我希望他不会因为那些医疗问题而误入歧途，以为自己凌晨四点回来就又年轻了，他一定很有礼貌，不吵醒我，他们发现我在喋喋不休地说些什么。晚上浪费钱，越来越醉，他们不能喝水，然后他开始给我们点鸡蛋、茶、芬顿哈迪和热黄油吐司，我想我们会让他像国王一样坐起来，把勺子抽错了一端无论他从哪里学到这些，我都会在他的蛋里上下活动，我爱早上听到他从楼梯上摔下来，杯子在托盘上嘎嘎作响，然后和那只猫玩耍，她为了自己的缘故而在你身上蹭来蹭去，我想知道她是不是跳蚤，她像一个总是舔舐的女人一样糟糕，但我讨厌他们的爪子 我想知道他们是否看到了什么我们不能那样盯着看的东西，当她坐在楼梯顶上这么久，听着我总是等待时，这也是一个强盗，我买了那个可爱的新鲜地方，我想我会得到一点鱼明天或今天是星期五 是的，我会像很久以前那样，加一些黑加仑果酱的牛奶冻，而不是来自伦敦和纽卡斯尔的 2 磅混合李子和苹果威廉姆斯和伍兹的两倍，只是为了骨头，我讨厌那些鳗鱼鳕鱼是的，我要吃一块不错的鳕鱼，我总是吃够3个人，无论如何，我厌倦了巴克利的腰排、腿牛肉、肋骨牛排、羊肉碎片和小牛拔毛，这个名字就足够了，或者野餐，假设我们所有人都给了 5 美元/每人，或者让他付钱并邀请其他女人为他服务，弗莱明夫人开车前往毛茸茸的峡谷或草莓地，我们让他首先检查所有马的脚趾甲，就像他对字母“不不”所做的那样博伊兰，是的，有一些冷的小牛肉和火腿混合三明治，那里的银行底部故意有一些小房子，但天气像火焰一样热，他说无论如何不是银行假期，我讨厌那些玛丽安煤箱今天出去圣灵降临节星期一也是一个被诅咒的日子，难怪蜜蜂在海边把他咬得更厉害，但在他在布雷告诉船夫他知道如何划船之后，我这辈子再也不会和他一起上船了，如果有人问他可以骑障碍赛吗？金杯他说是，然后它就开始变得粗暴，这个老东西歪歪扭扭，我身边的重量告诉我拉右缰绳，现在拉左缰绳，潮水淹没了底部的洪水，他的桨从马镫中滑落，幸亏我们没有被淹死，他当然可以游泳，我不，那里没有任何危险，穿着法兰绒裤子保持冷静，我真想当着所有人的面把他从他身上撕下来，给他一种所谓的鞭毛，直到他遍体鳞伤，只为了那个长鼻子的小伙子，祝他世界上所有的好事我不知道他是谁，和城市阿姆斯酒店外的另一个美女伯克一样，像往常一样在他不想要的地方监视着他，如果发生争吵，你会吐出一张更好的脸，我们之间没有失去爱，那就是1 安慰 我想知道他给我带来的那本书是什么样的 《罪恶的糖果》 由一位时尚绅士或其他德科克先生 我想人们给他起了这个绰号，因为他的管子从一个女人到另一个女人 我什至无法改变我的新白色鞋子都被咸水毁坏了，我戴的帽子上的羽毛都被风吹乱了，扔在我身上，多么烦人，多么令人恼火，因为大海的气味让我兴奋，当然，加泰罗尼亚海湾的沙丁鱼和鲷鱼在岩石后面，它们是它们渔民的篮子里全是银子，老路易吉将近一百岁，他们说来自热那亚，还有那个戴耳环的高个子老家伙，我不喜欢一个你必须爬上去才能拿到的人，我想除了我之外，他们都死了，早就腐烂了我不喜欢晚上独自待在这个大营房里，我想我必须忍受它，即使我们搬进他要在一楼客厅里建造的混乱的音乐学院，我也从未带过一丁点盐进去。他建议去毁掉一家黄铜板或布鲁姆斯私人酒店我自己完全就像他父亲在恩尼斯所做的那样，就像他告诉父亲他要做的所有事情和我一样，但我透过他告诉我我们可以去度蜜月的所有可爱的地方 月光下的威尼斯，有贡多拉和湖泊他用一些纸剪了一张科莫的照片，还有曼陀林和灯笼啊，我说的太好了，无论我喜欢什么，他都会立即做，如果不是早一点，你愿意成为我的男人吗？他发明的所有计划都用腻子圈住，然后把我们整天留在这里，你永远不会知道门口的老乞丐会用他的长篇故事来索取面包皮，他可能是个流浪汉，他用脚挡住了我的门，不让我把门关上。 《劳埃德周刊》报道了那个铁石心肠的罪犯的照片，他被《劳埃德周刊》称为入狱 20 年，然后他出狱并为了钱而谋杀了一位老妇，想象一下他可怜的妻子或母亲或无论她是谁，这样一张脸你会逃离数英里，我无法轻松休息直到我把所有的门窗都闩上，以确保安全，但更糟糕的是，被关在监狱或疯人院里，他们应该全部被枪杀，或者九尾猫这样的大畜生，会攻击一个可怜的老妇人在她床上谋杀她 我会切断他们与他的联系，这样我就不会再有什么用了，但那天晚上我确信我听到厨房里有窃贼的声音，他穿着衬衫，拿着蜡烛和拨火棍倒在地上，好像他正在寻找一只像床单一样白的老鼠，吓得魂不附体，为了窃贼的利益，尽可能多地发出声音，确实没有什么可偷的，上帝知道，这仍然是这种感觉，尤其是现在米莉对他来说没有这样的想法为了他祖父的缘故，送女孩去那里学习拍照，而不是送她去斯克里学校她必须在学院里学习，不像我在学校里得到所有的信息，他只会做这样的事情，尽管如此，因为我和博伊兰，这就是他这样做的原因，我确信他策划和计划一切的方式我无法扭转她最近在这个地方，除非我先把门锁上，否则当我把椅子靠在门上时，我会坐立不安，不敲门就进来，就像我戴着​​手套在下面洗澡一样，让你心烦意乱，然后整天做日志女士她在一个玻璃柜里，一次两个人看着她，如果他知道她在离开之前用她的粗鲁和粗心从那个小雕像上折断了手，我让那个意大利小男孩去修补，这样你就看不到连接了2先令甚至不会为你准备土豆，当然，她不毁了她的手是对的，我注意到他最近总是在餐桌上和她说话，解释报纸上的事情，她假装理解，当然，这来自他的一面房子他不能说，我假装事情可以，事实上，我太诚实了，帮她穿上外套，但如果她有什么问题，是我，她不会告诉他，我想他认为我已经完成并躺在架子上好吧，我不是不，也不是类似的东西，我们看到了，看到了，现在她也很适合和汤姆·德文斯调情，两个儿子模仿我，和那些嬉戏的穆雷女孩吹口哨，呼唤着她，米莉可以出来吗，她非常需要挑选他们能做的晚上在尼尔森街骑着哈利·德文斯自行车，他把她送到了她所在的地方，她刚刚出界，想去溜冰场，用鼻子抽烟，当我从她的衣服上闻到香烟的味道时咬断了我缝的纽扣的线她夹克的底部，她无法对我隐藏太多，我只告诉你，我不应该把它缝起来，它在她身上带来了分离，最后一个饱满的布丁太分裂成两半了，不管他们怎么说，她的舌头都看出来了有点太长了，不符合我的口味，你的衬衫开得太低了，她对我说锅叫水壶黑底，我不得不告诉她不要像窗台上展示的那样翘起双腿，然后所有路过的人都会看到当我像她这个年纪的时候，就像我一样，当然，任何旧破布都适合你，然后是一个很好的接触，也不是以她自己的方式，在皇家剧院的唯一方式，把你的脚拿开，我讨厌人们触摸我，因为害怕她生活 我会用褶皱压碎她的裙子 很多那种感动必须在黑暗中的拥挤中在剧院里进行 他们总是试图向你摇动 那个家伙在特里尔比比尔博姆树的欢乐坑里 我最后一次每隔两分钟就去那里像特里尔比或她的光屁股一样被压扁把我推到那里然后把目光移开他有点傻我想我是在瑞士窗外的同一个小游戏中试图接近两个衣着时尚的女士后看到他的，我认出了他在那一刻，他的脸和一切，但他不记得我了，是的，她甚至不想让我在布罗德斯通亲吻她，走得很好，我希望能找个人在她身上跳舞，就像她患腮腺炎时我所做的那样她的腺体肿胀在哪里，哪里，当然，她感觉不到任何深层次的东西，但我从来没有正确地到达，直到我大约22岁，它进入了错误的地方，总是只有常见的女孩胡言乱语和咯咯地笑，康尼·康诺利用白色墨水写信给她在用密封蜡密封的黑纸上，尽管当窗帘落下时她鼓掌，因为他看起来很英俊，然后我们吃了马丁·哈维（Martin Harvey）作为早餐、晚餐和晚餐，事后我心想，如果一个男人为了她而无缘无故地放弃自己的生命，那一定是真正的爱，我想有几个男人像这样留下了艰难的经历。相信这一点，除非这真的发生在我身上，他们中的大多数人本质上没有一丁点爱，现在发现两个像这样的人充满了彼此，会和你有同样的感觉，他们通常有点愚蠢他的父亲一定是有点奇怪，在她仍然可怜的老人之后去毒害自己，我想他感到迷失了，她也总是对我的东西做爱，我想把她的头发盘起来，我是我的粉末也只会毁了她的皮肤，她的时间足够她一辈子了，当然，她知道自己的嘴唇很漂亮，很红，很不安，可惜它们不会一直这样，我也是，但带着这个东西去集市是没有用的当我们在跑步比赛中遇见乔·加拉赫夫人的那天，当我要求去吃半块土豆时，她像鱼女一样回答我，她假装没有看到我们和律师弗里里一起陷入了陷阱，直到我给了她 2 块土豆。她自己的耳朵上有该死的细裂纹，现在就这样回答我，因为你的无礼，她让我恼怒，当然矛盾，我也脾气暴躁，因为茶里有杂草，或者我晚上没有睡觉在我吃奶酪之前，我一遍又一遍地告诉她不要让刀子像那样交叉，因为她没有人命令她，因为她自己说得很好，如果他不纠正她的信仰，我会的，那是她最后一次打开电源泪流满面，我自己就是这样，他们不敢命令我这个地方，这是他的错当然，让我们两个在这里做奴隶，而不是很久以前进入一个女人，我会再次拥有一个合适的仆人吗？当然，然后她看到他来了，我必须让她知道，否则他们会报仇，这不是一个令人讨厌的老太太吗？弗莱明，你必须在她把东西放在手里打喷嚏，放屁到锅里之后走来走去，当然，她老了，她无能为力，干得好，我发现梳妆台后面丢失了那块腐烂的旧臭抹布，我知道那里有然后打开窗户，散发出气味，把他的朋友带进来招待他们，就像那天晚上他带着狗回家一样，如果你愿意的话，这可能很生气，尤其是西蒙·迪达勒斯的儿子，他的父亲，他是一个戴着眼镜的批评者。在板球比赛中他戴着高帽子，袜子上有一个大洞，一件事是嘲笑另一件事，而他的儿子则因为在中间赢得的任何东西而获得了所有这些奖品想象一下，如果有人看到他认识我们，他就爬过栏杆我想知道他没有在他那件盛大的葬礼裤上撕出一个大洞，就好像大自然给的一个还不足以让任何人把他拉到肮脏的旧厨房里，现在他就在他的脑子里吗我想可惜今天不是洗我的旧抽屉的日子可能也挂在展览线上，因为他关心铁模标记，愚蠢的旧包烧在他们身上，他可能认为是别的东西，她甚至从来没有把我告诉她的脂肪降下来，现在她要去诸如她是因为她瘫痪的丈夫病情恶化，他们总是有问题，疾病，或者他们必须接受手术，或者如果不是因为喝酒，他打了她，我每天都得再到处找人，我起床了关于甜蜜的上帝的一些新事物亲爱的上帝，当我躺在坟墓里死去时，我想 111 有一些平安，如果我让我等一下，我想站起来一分钟哦，耶稣等等，是的，那件事发生在我身上，是的，现在这不会让你痛苦吗？当然，所有的戳和他现在已经在我身上扎根和犁地了，我该怎么办周五周六周日这不会让灵魂出窍，除非他喜欢，有些人做上帝知道我们总是有问题每三到四周五天通常每月那天晚上的拍卖难道不是让我感到恶心吗，这是我们唯一一次在迈克尔·冈恩给他的包厢里去欢乐街看肯德尔夫人和她的丈夫，他在德里米斯为他做了一些保险，我很适合尽管我不会屈服于那位戴着眼镜的时尚绅士，他在我的另一边谈论着斯宾诺莎和他死了的灵魂，我想数百万年前，我在一个微笑中尽了最大的努力。沼泽向前倾斜，好像我有兴趣必须坐下来然后到最后一个标签我不会忘记斯卡利的妻子匆忙应该是一部关于通奸的快速戏剧那个白痴在画廊里发出嘶嘶声他大喊的女人通奸我想他去，让一个女人在隔壁巷子里跑来跑去，以弥补这一点，我希望他能拥有我所拥有的东西，然后他嘘，我敢打赌，猫本身比我们过得更好，我们身上有太多的血吗？哦，耐心吧，它像大海一样从我身上倾泻而出，无论如何，他没有让我像他那么大的人怀孕，我不想毁掉我刚刚穿上的干净床单，我想我穿的干净亚麻布也把它带来了，该死的，该死的他们总是想看到床上的污渍就知道你对他们来说是处女，这一切都困扰着他们，他们也太傻了，你可能是寡妇或离婚了 40 次，涂抹红墨水就可以了，或者黑莓汁，不，那太紫了，詹姆斯啊，让我摆脱这个罪恶的甜食，谁建议女人做生意，在衣服、烹饪和孩子之间，这张该死的旧床太叮当作响了我想狄更斯夫妇可以在公园的另一边听到我们的声音，直到我建议把被子放在地板上，把枕头放在屁股下面，我想知道白天会不会更好，我认为这很容易，我想我会把所有东西都剪掉我身上的头发烫伤了我，我可能看起来像个年轻女孩，下次他把我的衣服翻到我身上时，他不会被吸得厉害吗？我在那个旧马桶之后我想知道我坐在他的膝盖上太重了我故意让他坐在安乐椅上当我在另一个房间先脱掉我的衬衫和裙子时他是如此忙碌，他不应该在他不应该在的地方他从来没有感觉到我我希望在那些接吻后我的呼吸是甜的 轻松上帝 我记得有一次我可以直接像一个男人一样吹口哨几乎轻松地发现它 上帝啊多么吵闹我希望他们是为了一团钱从某个111必须香水的人那里得到的泡沫早上别忘了，我敢打赌他从来没有见过比这更好的大腿，看起来它们有多白，最光滑的地方就在这中间，这里多么柔软，像桃子一样容易上帝我不介意成为一个男人并起床一个可爱的女人主啊，你像泽西百合一样吵闹，很容易，很容易哦，拉合尔的水是如何落下的

who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from I years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though
谁知道我的内脏是否有什么问题，或者我体内有什么东西在生长，每周都会出现这样的情况是什么时候，我是圣灵降临节星期一，是的，只有大约三周，我应该去看医生，只是它会像以前一样当我身上有白色的东西时，我就嫁给了他，弗洛伊让我去彭布罗克路上那根干燥的老棍子科林斯医生那里治疗女性疾病，他称之为你的阴道，我想这就是他如何让所有镀金镜子和地毯围绕着那些东西的。史蒂芬绿地里的有钱人为了每一次小小的摆弄她的阴道和她的交趾支那而跑向他，他们当然有钱，所以他们没事我不会嫁给他，除非他是世界上最后一个男人，而且他们的孩子总是在周围闻到一些奇怪的东西那些肮脏的母狗四面八方问我，我所做的是否有令人厌恶的气味，他想让我做什么，但唯一的一件事是金子，如果我用我所有的赞美把它涂在他满是皱纹的老脸上，我想他会然后你就知道了，你能轻松地通过它吗？我以为他在谈论直布罗陀的岩石，就像他所说的那样，这也是一个非常好的发明，顺便说一句，只是我喜欢在洞里尽我所能地让自己失望然后拉动链条，然后冲洗它，很酷，里面还有东西，我想我小时候总是通过米莉丝知道她是否有虫子，但仍然付给他多少钱一几内亚医生，请问我是否经常遗漏，那些老家伙从哪里得到他们遗漏的所有单词，他的近视眼睛斜斜地看着我，我不会太相信他给我氯仿，或者上帝知道我还喜欢他什么当他坐下来写这篇文章时那件事皱着眉头那么严重，他的鼻子聪明得就像你该死的，你撒谎带子哦，无论是谁，除了一个白痴，他足够聪明，发现了这一切，当然，这都是在想他和他疯狂的疯狂信件，我的宝贝，一切都相连与你光荣的身体一起强调的一切都是一件美丽而快乐的事情，他从一本无意义的书中得到了这些东西，他让我总是每天四五次，我说我没有，你确定吗哦，是的，我说我很确定，在某种程度上让他闭嘴了，我知道接下来会发生什么，只是天生的弱点，他让我兴奋，我不知道我们见面的第一个晚上，当我住在里霍博斯露台时，我们站在那里盯着看彼此聊了大约几分钟，好像我们在某个地方见过面，我想是因为我是犹太人，照顾我的母亲，他常常用他说的话来逗我开心，脸上挂着半慵懒的微笑，还有道尔斯所说的他将代表的一切国会议员哦，我不是天生的傻瓜，竟然相信了他关于地方自治和土地联盟的所有胡言乱语，给我送了一首胡格诺派的长篇歌曲，用法语唱得更优雅哦，我的花花公子支付德拉图兰，我他甚至从来没有唱过一次关于宗教和迫害的解释和胡言乱语他不会让你自然地享受任何东西那么他可以作为一个很大的帮助他第一次有机会在布莱顿广场跑进我的卧室假装墨水沾到了他的手上洗了它把我以前用过的阿尔比恩牛奶和硫磺肥皂拿掉，周围还有明胶哦，那天我对他笑得很厉害，我最好不要在这件事上整夜坐着，他们应该把房间做成自然大小，这样女人就可以坐着他正确地跪下去做这件事我想世界上没有另一个人有这样的习惯，他看着他在床脚睡觉的方式，他怎么可能没有硬枕，他不会踢，否则他可能会用手打掉我所有的牙齿呼吸在他的鼻子上，就像那位印度神一样，他带我去基尔代尔街的博物馆展示了一个湿漉漉的周日，他穿着一件黄色的围裙，侧身躺在他的手上，十个脚趾伸出来，他说这是一个比犹太人更伟大的宗教，我们亚洲各地的贵族们都聚集在一起模仿他，因为他总是模仿每个人，我想他也曾经睡在床脚上，把他的大脚放在他妻子的嘴里，该死的这个臭东西无论如何，那些餐巾在哪里啊是的我知道我希望旧媒体不会吱吱作响啊我知道他会睡得很香在某个地方度过了愉快的时光她一定给了他很大的价值他的钱当然他必须从她那里付钱哦这件令人讨厌的事情我希望他们能在另一个世界为我们提供更好的东西，把自己绑起来，上帝保佑我们，今晚就这样吧，现在那张凹凸不平、叮当作响的旧床总是让我想起老科恩，我想他经常在上面抓伤自己，他认为这是父亲从那里买的。当我还是个小女孩的时候，我曾经很崇拜纳皮尔勋爵，因为我告诉他简单的钢琴哦，我喜欢我的床，上帝在这里，16年后我们还是一如既往的糟糕，我们在雷蒙德露台、安大略露台和朗伯德街住过多少栋房子和霍勒斯街，每次他再次逃跑时，他都会吹口哨，他的胡格诺派或青蛙游行假装帮助我们的四根家具，然后城市武器酒店越来越糟糕，典狱长戴利说，着陆点上那个迷人的地方总是有人在里面祈祷，然后留下所有的臭味每当有事情发生时，他们总是知道最后是谁在里面，或者他把大脚放进去，汤姆斯和赫利斯，卡夫斯先生和德里米斯，要么他会因为他的旧彩票而进监狱。成为我们全部的救赎，否则他会厚颜无耻地离开，让他很快从自由人那里带着麻袋回家，就像其他人一样，因为那些罪人费因或共济会成员，然后我们看看他向我展示的那个小个子是否在运球科迪斯巷的湿身会给他带来很大的安慰，他说他是如此有能力和真诚的爱尔兰人，他确实是通过我在他身上看到的裤子的诚意来判断的，等待乔治教堂的钟声等待三刻钟我等待2嗯，这对他来说是晚上的好时光，可以回家见任何爬下该区域的人，如果有人看到他，明天我会先让他改掉这个小习惯，我会看看他的衬衫，或者我会看看他是否有那个习惯。法国信还在他的钱包里 我想他认为我不认识骗子 他们的20个口袋都不足以装下他们的谎言 那么我们为什么要告诉他们 即使这是事实 他们也不相信你然后像贵族中的那些婴儿一样躺在床上他又给我带来了杰作，就好像我们在现实生活中没有受够这样的东西，没有一些老贵族或任何他的名字让你更恶心的烂照片，孩子们有两个头，没有腿，这就是他们总是梦想着的那种恶行。他们空荡荡的脑袋里还有一件事，他们应该慢慢毒死他们的一半，然后为他喝茶和烤面包，两面都涂上黄油，再放上新生的鸡蛋，我想，当我不让他在霍尔斯街舔我时，我想我就什么都不是了，男人男人暴君作为e唯一的一件事是，他半夜赤身裸体地睡在地板上，就像犹太人在有人死时所用的那样，属于他们，不吃任何早餐，也不说一句话，想要被抚摸，所以我想我有一次足够引人注目，让他做这一切都是错的，只考虑自己的快乐，他的舌头太平了，或者我不知道他忘记了什么，如果我不这样做，我会让他再做一次，如果他不介意自己，把他锁在煤窖里睡觉。黑甲虫我想知道是不是她乔西和我的抛弃物一起掉了头，他也是一个天生的骗子，不，他从来没有勇气和一个已婚女人在一起，这就是为什么他想要我和博伊兰，不过至于她的丹尼斯，她称他为那种孤独的景象你不能称他为丈夫，是的，即使当我和米莉一起参加大学比赛时，他还是和某个小母狗混在一起了。霍恩布洛尔头顶上戴着孩子的帽子，让我们从他扔羊的后面进去。看着那两个在裙子上上下班的人，我先试着对他眨眼，当然没用，这就是他的钱去的方式，这是帕迪·迪格纳姆先生的成果，是的，他们在报纸上的盛大葬礼上都很有风格如果他们看到真正的军官葬礼，博伊兰就会带进来，那会是一些倒转的手臂，闷闷不乐的鼓，那匹可怜的马，穿着黑色的L Boom跟在后面走，还有汤姆·克南，那个喝醉了的矮个桶男人，咬掉了舌头，在某个地方喝醉了，掉进了男厕所。马丁·坎宁安和两个德达卢斯和范妮·麦克伊的丈夫 白菜头，瘦瘦的，眼睛转动，试图唱我的歌，她想重生，她的旧绿色低领连衣裙，因为她无法吸引他们其他方式就像在雨天涉水我现在看到了一切他们称之为友谊杀戮，然后互相埋葬，他们都和他们的妻子和家人一起在家里，尤其是杰克·鲍尔（Jack Power）保留着他做的那个酒吧女招待，当然他的妻子总是生病或即将生病，或者只是在康复，他仍然是一个英俊的男人，虽然他的耳朵有点灰白，但他们都很好，他们都很好，如果我能帮助它在背后取笑他，他们就不会再让我的丈夫落入他们的手中，我很清楚什么时候他继续他的白痴行为，因为他有足够的理智，不会浪费他赚来的每一分钱，并照顾他的妻子和家人，不管怎样，可怜的帕迪·迪格纳姆（Paddy Dignam），但我在某种程度上为他感到遗憾，他的妻子和5个孩子是什么？除非他有保险，否则滑稽的小提托姆总是困在某个酒吧角落里，她或她的儿子在等比尔·贝利，你能不能回家吧，她的寡妇杂草不会改善她的外表，但如果你长得好看，他们就变得很糟糕，他不是，是的，他在格伦克里的晚宴上，那天晚上，本·多拉德在霍尔斯街借了燕尾服唱歌，挤了进去，挤在他们身上，在他那张多莉大脸上咧着嘴笑，就像一个精心鞭打的孩子的屁股，他看起来不是一个温暖的球吗？想象一下，在舞台上花 5 块钱坐在保留的座位上，看到他驾着拖钓船小跑，西蒙·迪达勒斯也一样，他总是半醉半醒地出现，先唱第二节，旧爱是新爱，这一定是舞台上的奇观他的歌如此甜美地唱着《山楂树上的少女》，当我在弗雷迪·梅耶斯私人歌剧院和他一起唱《玛丽塔娜》时，他也总是在调情，他的声音美妙而美妙，菲比，最亲爱的再见，甜心亲爱的，他总是唱这首歌，不像巴特尔·达西那样甜腻，再见，当然他有声音的天赋，所以你身上没有艺术，就像一个温暖的淋浴浴缸哦，玛丽塔娜野木花，我们唱得很精彩，虽然有点太高了因为我的登记册甚至被调换了，他当时和梅·古尔丁结婚了，但后来他说了或做了一些事情来消除它的好处，他现在是一个鳏夫，我想知道他的儿子是什么样的，他说他是一名作家，并将成为一名作家大学意大利语教授，我要上课，他现在在开什么车，给他看我的照片，这对我来说不太好，我应该把它放在窗帘上拍，看起来永远不会过时，但我穿着它看起来很年轻，我想知道他没有做他是一份礼物，我也是，毕竟为什么不呢？我看到他和他的父母一起开车去金斯布里奇车站，我正在哀悼那是11年前的事了，现在是的，他已经11岁了，但是哀悼有什么好处呢？既不是一件事，也不是另一件事，第一声哭声对我来说已经足够了，我听到死亡手表在墙上滴答作响，当然他坚持要为那只猫哀悼，我想他现在已经是一个男人了，那时他是一个无辜的男孩还有一个可爱的小家伙，穿着方特勒罗伊勋爵的西装，卷发像王子一样在舞台上，当我在马特·狄龙斯看到他时，他也喜欢我，我记得他们都在等待上帝，是的，是的，是的，等一下，今天早上他就在名单上当我和一个你之前见过的既不黑暗也不公平的年轻陌生人摆出牌组联盟时，我以为这意味着他，但他既不是胆小鬼也不是陌生人，除了我的脸转向另一个方向之外，黑桃10之后的第七张牌是什么对于陆路旅行来说，途中有一封信，还有丑闻，3 个皇后和 8 个钻石用于上升在社会上，是的，等等，一切都出来了，新衣服有 2 个红色 8，看看那个，我不是也梦想过一些东西吗，是的，里面有一些关于诗歌的东西，我希望他没有长长的油腻的头发挂在他的眼睛里，或者像一个红色印第安人一样站起来他们为什么要这样做，只让自己和他们的诗歌被嘲笑，当我还是个女孩的时候，我一直很喜欢诗歌，我认为他是像拜伦勋爵一样的诗人，但他的作品中没有一丝诗意，我认为他很不同我想知道他是否太年轻了，他要等一下 88 我结婚了 88 昨天米莉 15 岁 89 他当时在狄龙斯的年龄 5 岁或 6 岁左右 88 我想他 20 岁或以上 如果他 23 或 24 岁，我对他来说还不算太老 我希望他不是那种自以为是的大学生，不，否则他不会坐在旧厨房里和他一起喝艾普斯可可并说话，当然他假装理解这一切，可能他告诉他他已经从三一学院毕业了，他很年轻就成为一名教授我希望他不是像古德温那样的教授，他是约翰·詹姆森的一位有力的教授，他们都在诗歌中写到了某个女人，我想他不会找到像我这样的人，轻轻地叹息着爱，轻吉他，空气中弥漫着诗歌蓝色的大海和月亮如此美丽地从塔里法乘夜船回来欧罗巴角的灯塔那个家伙弹的吉他是如此富有表现力我会再回到那里所有新面孔两个扫视的眼睛一个格子隐藏我会为他唱那首歌我的眼睛，如果他是个诗人的话，两只眼睛像爱自己的星星一样黑暗明亮，这不是像爱年轻的星星那样美丽的话语，上帝知道有一个聪明的人谈论你自己而不是总是听他和比利·普雷斯科特，这将是一个改变广告、Keyess 广告和 Tom the Devils 广告，那么如果他们的生意出了什么差错，我们都得受苦 我确信他非常杰出 我想见到这样的一个人 上帝，除了他年轻之外，不是那些其他的混蛋 那些优秀的年轻人 我可以从岩石边看到马盖特海滨浴场像上帝一样裸体在阳光下，然后和他们一起跳进海里，为什么不是所有的男人都这样，对一个像他买的那个可爱的小雕像这样的女人来说是一些安慰我可以整天看着他卷发的头和他的把他的手指举起来让你听，对你来说，那里有真正的美丽和诗意，我经常觉得我想亲吻他的全身，还有他可爱的年轻鸡巴，那么简单，如果没有人看起来好像在问我，我不介意把他含在嘴里你把它吸得那么干净，那么白，他看起来像个孩子气的脸，我也会在 1/2 分钟内，即使其中一些掉下来，就像稀粥或露水，除了与那些猪相比，他是如此干净之外，没有任何危险我想男人们从来没有梦想过从年终到另一年都会洗掉它，大多数人只是因为这才让女人留胡子我确信，如果我能和一个在我这个年纪的英俊的年轻诗人在一起，那就太棒了我会把它们扔掉早上的第一件事，直到我看看愿望卡是否出来，或者我会尝试将这位女士本人配对，看看他是否出来我会阅读和学习我能找到的所有内容，或者记住一点，如果我知道他喜欢谁，那么他如果他认为所有女人都一样，就不会认为我愚蠢，我可以教他另一部分，我会让他感觉全身都在他身上，直到他在我身下半晕倒，然后他也会公开写我的情人和情妇，并在所有照片中公开我们的两张照片当他成名时我会发表论文哦，但是我该怎么办他呢

no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent I atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is I s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want LI or perhaps 30/Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar I Id a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes
