On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way between Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud, rosecolored hotel. Deferential palms cool its flushed façade, and before it stretches a short dazzling beach. Lately it has become a summer resort of notable and fashionable people; a decade ago it was almost deserted after its English clientele went north in April. Now, many bungalows cluster near it, but when this story begins only the cupolas of a dozen old villas rotted like water lilies among the massed pines between Gausse’s Hôtel des Étrangers and Cannes, five miles away.
在法国里维埃拉宜人的海岸上，大约在马赛和意大利边境之间的中间，矗立着一座宏伟的、玫瑰色的大酒店。恭顺的棕榈树为它泛红的外墙带来凉爽，在它之前延伸着一片短暂的、令人眼花缭乱的海滩。近年来，这里已成为名人、时尚人士的避暑胜地。十年前，英国顾客四月北上后，这里几乎荒无人烟。现在，许多平房聚集在它附近，但当故事开始时，只有高斯的外国人酒店和五英里外的戛纳之间的十几座老别墅的圆顶像睡莲一样腐烂在松树丛中。

The hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were one. In the early morning the distant image of Cannes, the pink and cream of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy, were cast across the water and lay quavering in the ripples and rings sent up by sea-plants through the clear shallows. Before eight a man came down to the beach in a blue bathrobe and with much preliminary application to his person of the chilly water, and much grunting and loud breathing, floundered a minute in the sea. When he had gone, beach and bay were quiet for an hour. Merchantmen crawled westward on the horizon; bus boys shouted in the hotel court; the dew dried upon the pines. In another hour the horns of motors began to blow down from the winding road along the low range of the Maures, which separates the littoral from true Provençal France.
酒店及其明亮的棕褐色海滩祈祷地毯就是其中之一。清晨，戛纳的远景、粉色和奶油色的古老防御工事、意大利边界的紫色阿尔卑斯山，都投射在水面上，在清澈浅滩上的海洋植物发出的涟漪和圆环中颤抖着。八点不到，一个穿着蓝色浴袍的男人来到海滩，先用冷水浇在身上，一边咕哝着，呼吸声很大，在海里挣扎了一分钟。当他走后，海滩和海湾安静了一个小时。商人们在地平线上向西爬行；公交车男孩在酒店庭院里大喊；松树上的露水干了。又过了一个小时，汽车的喇叭声开始从沿着莫里斯低地山脉的蜿蜒道路上吹下来，莫里斯山脉将沿海地区与真正的普罗旺斯法国分开。

A mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty poplars, is an isolated railroad stop, whence one June morning in 1925 a victoria brought a woman and her daughter down to Gausse’s Hotel. The mother’s face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way. However, one’s eye moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening. Her fine forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.
距大海一英里处，松树已被尘土飞扬的白杨树所取代，这里有一个偏僻的火车站，1925 年 6 月的一个早晨，一艘维多利亚号载着一位妇女和她的女儿来到高斯酒店。母亲的脸庞渐渐失去了美丽，很快就布满了破裂的血管。她的表情既平静又清醒，令人愉悦。然而，人们的目光很快就转移到了她的女儿身上，她粉红色的手掌充满了魔力，脸颊上闪着可爱的火焰，就像孩子们晚上洗完冷水澡后惊心动魄的红晕。她美丽的前额轻轻地倾斜到她的头发，周围像一个盾牌，爆发出浅金色和金色的爱情发、波浪和花饰。她的眼睛明亮、大、清澈、湿润、闪亮，脸颊的颜色是真实的，从她年轻的心脏强劲的跳动中浮现出来。她的身体微妙地徘徊在童年的最后边缘——她已经快十八岁了，几乎完整了，但露珠还留在她身上。

As sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line the mother said:
当大海和天空在他们下方出现，形成一条细细的热线时，母亲说道：

‘Something tells me we’re not going to like this place.’
“有件事告诉我，我们不会喜欢这个地方。”

‘I want to go home anyhow,’ the girl answered.
“无论如何，我想回家。”女孩回答道。

They both spoke cheerfully but were obviously without direction and bored by the fact—moreover, just any direction would not do. They wanted high excitement, not from the necessity of stimulating jaded nerves but with the avidity of prize-winning schoolchildren who deserved their vacations.
两人都说得很高兴，但显然没有方向，而且对事实感到厌烦——而且，光有方向是不行的。他们想要高度兴奋，不是因为需要刺激疲惫的神经，而是因为获奖学生的热情，他们值得享受假期。

‘We’ll stay three days and then go home. I’ll wire right away for steamer tickets.’
“我们要待三天，然后就回家。我会立即电汇索取轮船票。

At the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic but rather flat French, like something remembered. When they were installed on the ground floor she walked into the glare of the French windows and out a few steps onto the stone veranda that ran the length of the hotel. When she walked she carried herself like a balletdancer, not slumped down on her hips but held up in the small of her back. Out there the hot light clipped close her shadow and she retreated—it was too bright to see. Fifty yards away the Mediterranean yielded up its pigments, moment by moment, to the brutal sunshine; below the balustrade a faded Buick cooked on the hotel drive.
在旅馆里，女孩用地道但相当平淡的法语预订了房间，就像记忆中的东西一样。当它们安装在一楼时，她走进了法式窗户的眩光中，走了几步，来到了与酒店一样长的石头阳台上。当她走路时，她的姿态就像一位芭蕾舞演员，不是胯部塌陷，而是挺起腰部。外面的热光遮住了她的影子，她退了出去——太亮了，看不见。五十码外的地中海在残酷的阳光下一刻一刻地褪去色彩。栏杆下面停着一辆褪色的别克车，在酒店的车道上烧焦了。

Indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with activity. Three British nannies sat knitting the slow pattern of Victorian England, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, and the eighties, into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip as formalized as incantation; closer to the sea a dozen persons kept house under striped umbrellas, while their dozen children pursued unintimidated fish through the shallows or lay naked and glistening with cocoanut oil out in the sun.
事实上，在所有地区中，只有海滩热闹非凡。三位英国保姆坐在那儿，按照像咒语一样形式化的八卦曲调，将维多利亚时代英格兰的缓慢图案、四十年代、六十年代和八十年代的图案编织成毛衣和袜子；离海边较近的地方，有十几个人撑着条纹伞，他们的十几个孩子则在浅滩上追逐着无所畏惧的鱼，或者赤身裸体地躺在阳光下，身上的椰子油闪闪发光。

As Rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran past her and dashed into the sea with exultant cries. Feeling the impactive scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her bathrobe and followed. She floated face down for a few yards and finding it shallow staggered to her feet and plodded forward, dragging slim legs like weights against the resistance of the water. When it was about breast high, she glanced back toward shore: a bald man in a monocle and a pair of tights, his tufted chest thrown out, his brash navel sucked in, was regarding her attentively. As Rosemary returned the gaze the man dislodged the monocle, which went into hiding amid the facetious whiskers of his chest, and poured himself a glass of something from a bottle in his hand.
当罗斯玛丽来到海滩上时，一个十二岁的男孩从她身边跑过，兴奋地大叫着冲进海里。感受着陌生面孔充满冲击力的审视，她脱下浴袍跟了上去。她面朝下漂浮了几码，发现水很浅，她摇摇晃晃地站起来，沉重地向前走，拖着细长的腿，像重物一样抵抗着水的阻力。当水位大约齐胸高时，她回头看了一眼岸边：一个戴着单片眼镜、穿着紧身衣的秃头男人，他的簇绒胸脯向外突出，傲慢的肚脐内收，正在聚精会神地看着她。当罗斯玛丽回望他的时候，男人摘下单片眼镜，把它藏在他胸口滑稽的胡须中，然后从手里的瓶子里给自己倒了一杯什么东西。

Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppy little fourbeat crawl out to the raft. The water reached up for her, pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her hair and ran into the corners of her body. She turned round and round in it, embracing it, wallowing in it. Reaching the raft she was out of breath, but a tanned woman with very white teeth looked down at her, and Rosemary, suddenly conscious of the raw whiteness of her own body, turned on her back and drifted toward shore. The hairy man holding the bottle spoke to her as she came out.
罗斯玛丽把脸埋在水面上，以波涛汹涌的小四节拍游向木筏。水向她袭来，温柔地将她从炎热中拉下来，渗入她的头发，流进她身体的角落。她在其中转来转去，拥抱着它，沉溺其中。到达木筏时，她已经上气不接下气了，但是一个晒得黑黑、牙齿很白的女人低头看着她，罗斯玛丽突然意识到自己身体的洁白，转身仰面朝岸边漂去。当她出来时，拿着瓶子的毛茸茸的男人对她说话。

‘I say—they have sharks out behind the raft.’ He was of indeterminate nationality, but spoke English with a slow Oxford drawl. ‘Yesterday they devoured two British sailors from the flotte at Golfe Juan.’
“我说——木筏后面有鲨鱼。”他的国籍不详，但说英语时拖着拖沓的牛津腔。 “昨天，他们在胡安湾吞噬了两名英国水手。”

‘Heavens!’ exclaimed Rosemary.
“天哪！”罗斯玛丽惊呼道。

‘They come in for the refuse from the flotte.’
“他们是来取船上垃圾的。”

Glazing his eyes to indicate that he had only spoken in order to warn her, he minced off two steps and poured himself another drink.
他目光呆滞，表示自己只是为了警告她才这样说的，然后踉踉跄跄地退了两步，又给自己倒了一杯酒。

Not unpleasantly self-conscious, since there had been a slight sway of attention toward her during this conversation, Rosemary looked for a place to sit. Obviously each family possessed the strip of sand immediately in front of its umbrella; besides there was much visiting and talking back and forth—the atmosphere of a community upon which it would be presumptuous to intrude. Farther up, where the beach was strewn with pebbles and dead sea-weed, sat a group with flesh as white as her own. They lay under small hand-parasols instead of beach umbrellas and were obviously less indigenous to the place. Between the dark people and the light, Rosemary found room and spread out her peignoir on the sand.
罗斯玛丽并没有感到不舒服，因为在这次谈话中，有人的注意力稍微转向了她，罗斯玛丽找了个地方坐下。显然，每个家庭都拥有紧邻其伞前的那条沙子；此外，还有很多来访和来来往往的谈话——这种氛围是一种擅自闯入的社区氛围。再远一点的地方，海滩上散布着鹅卵石和枯死的海草，那里坐着一群人，他们的皮肤和她的一样白。它们躺在小手遮阳伞下，而不是沙滩伞下，显然不太适合这个地方。在黑暗的人群和光明之间，罗斯玛丽找到了空间，将她的皮诺瓦摊开在沙滩上。

Lying so, she first heard their voices and felt their feet skirt her body and their shapes pass between the sun and herself. The breath of an inquisitive dog blew warm and nervous on her neck; she could feel her skin broiling a little in the heat and hear the small exhausted wa-waa of the expiring waves. Presently her ear distinguished individual voices and she became aware that some one referred to scornfully as ‘that North guy’ had kidnapped a waiter from a café in Cannes last night in order to saw him in two. The sponsor of the story was a white-haired woman in full evening dress, obviously a relic of the previous evening, for a tiara still clung to her head and a discouraged orchid expired from her shoulder. Rosemary, forming a vague antipathy to her and her companions, turned away.
躺着时，她首先听到了他们的声音，感觉到他们的脚绕过她的身体，他们的形状在太阳和她自己之间穿过。一只好奇的狗的呼吸温暖而紧张地吹在她的脖子上；她能感觉到自己的皮肤在高温下有点烤焦，听到海浪发出的疲惫的小声“哇哇”声。不久，她的耳朵辨别出了不同的声音，她意识到昨晚有人轻蔑地称为“那个北方人”，绑架了戛纳一家咖啡馆的一名服务员，目的是为了把他分成两半。这个故事的发起者是一位身穿晚礼服的白发女子，显然是前一天晚上的遗物，因为她头上还戴着一顶头饰，一朵沮丧的兰花从她的肩膀上消失了。罗斯玛丽对她和她的同伴产生了隐隐约约的反感，转身走开。

Nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under a roof of umbrellas making out a list of things from a book open on the sand. Her bathing suit was pulled off her shoulders and her back, a ruddy, orange brown, set off by a string of creamy pearls, shone in the sun. Her face was hard and lovely and pitiful. Her eyes met Rosemary’s but did not see her. Beyond her was a fine man in a jockey cap and red-striped tights; then the woman Rosemary had seen on the raft, and who looked back at her, seeing her; then a man with a long face and a golden, leonine head, with blue tights and no hat, talking very seriously to an unmistakably Latin young man in black tights, both of them picking at little pieces of seaweed in the sand. She thought they were mostly Americans, but something made them unlike the Americans she had known of late.
在离她最近的另一边，一位年轻女子躺在遮阳伞下，从沙滩上打开的一本书中列出了一份清单。她的泳衣从肩膀上脱下来，背上呈现出红润的橙棕色，衬托着一串奶油色的珍珠，在阳光下闪闪发光。她的脸冷酷、可爱、可怜。她的目光与罗斯玛丽的目光相遇，但没有看到她。她身后是一个戴着赛马帽、穿着红色条纹紧身衣的英俊男人。然后是罗斯玛丽在木筏上看到的那个女人，她回头看着她，看到了她。然后是一个长着一张长脸、金色狮子头、穿着蓝色紧身衣、没有戴帽子的男人，非常严肃地和一个穿着黑色紧身衣的拉丁年轻人交谈，两人都在捡沙子里的小块海藻。她以为他们大多是美国人，但有些东西使他们与她最近认识的美国人不同。

After a while she realized that the man in the jockey cap was giving a quiet little performance for this group; he moved gravely about with a rake, ostensibly removing gravel and meanwhile developing some esoteric burlesque held in suspension by his grave face. Its faintest ramification had become hilarious, until whatever he said released a burst of laughter. Even those who, like herself, were too far away to hear, sent out antennæ of attention until the only person on the beach not caught up in it was the young woman with the string of pearls. Perhaps from modesty of possession she responded to each salvo of amusement by bending closer over her list.
过了一会儿，她意识到那个戴骑师帽的男人正在为这群人表演一场安静的小表演；他拿着耙子严肃地四处走动，表面上是在清除碎石，同时在他严肃的脸上表现出一些深奥的滑稽表演。它最微弱的后果已经变得很搞笑，直到他所说的一切都引发了一阵笑声。甚至那些像她一样距离太远听不到的人也发出了关注，直到海滩上唯一没有被关注的人是那个带着珍珠串的年轻女子。也许是出于占有欲的谦虚，她对每一次的娱乐活动都会弯下腰仔细查看她的清单。

The man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out of the sky above Rosemary.
戴单片眼镜和酒瓶的男人突然从迷迭香上方的天空中开口说道。

‘You are a ripping swimmer.’
“你是个游泳健将。”

She demurred.
她表示反对。

‘Jolly good. My name is Campion. Here is a lady who says she saw you in Sorrento last week and knows who you are and would so like to meet you.’
‘太好了。我叫坎皮恩。这位女士说她上周在索伦托见过您，知道您是谁，并且很想见到您。

Glancing around with concealed annoyance Rosemary saw the untanned people were waiting. Reluctantly she got up and went over to them.
罗斯玛丽带着掩饰的烦恼环顾四周，看到那些没有晒黑的人正在等待。她不情愿地站起来，走到他们身边。

‘Mrs. Abrams—Mrs. McKisco—Mr. McKisco—Mr. Dumphry—
'太太。艾布拉姆斯——夫人麦基斯科——先生。麦基斯科——先生。邓弗里——

‘We know who you are,’ spoke up the woman in evening dress. ‘You’re Rosemary Hoyt and I recognized you in Sorrento and asked the hotel clerk and we all think you’re perfectly marvellous and we want to know why you’re not back in America making another marvellous moving picture.’
“我们知道你是谁，”穿晚礼服的女人说道。 “你是罗斯玛丽·霍伊特，我在索伦托认出了你，并向酒店服务员询问，我们都认为你太棒了，我们想知道你为什么不回到美国拍摄另一部精彩的电影。”

They made a superfluous gesture of moving over for her. The woman who had recognized her was not a Jewess, despite her name. She was one of those elderly ‘good sports’ preserved by an imperviousness to experience and a good digestion into another generation.
他们做了一个多余的动作，为她让开。尽管她的名字如此，认出她的那个女人却不是犹太人。她是那些因不受经验影响和对下一代的良好消化而保留下来的“好运动”老人之一。

‘We wanted to warn you about getting burned the first day,’ she continued cheerily, ‘because YOUR skin is important, but there seems to be so darn much formality on this beach that we didn’t know whether you’d mind.’
“我们想警告你第一天不要被烧伤，”她高兴地继续说道，“因为你的皮肤很重要，但这个海滩上似乎有太多的拘谨，我们不知道你是否介意。”

II

‘We thought maybe you were in the plot,’ said Mrs. McKisco. She was a shabby-eyed, pretty young woman with a disheartening intensity. ‘We don’t know who’s in the plot and who isn’t. One man my husband had been particularly nice to turned out to be a chief character—practically the assistant hero.’
“我们以为你可能参与了阴谋，”麦基斯科夫人说。她是一位眼睛破旧、漂亮的年轻女子，有着令人沮丧的紧张情绪。 “我们不知道谁在阴谋中，谁不在阴谋中。我丈夫特别友善的一个人最终成为了主角——实际上是助手英雄。

‘The plot?’ inquired Rosemary, half understanding. ‘Is there a plot?’
“情节？”罗斯玛丽半明白地问道。 “有阴谋吗？”

‘My dear, we don’t KNOW,’ said Mrs. Abrams, with a convulsive, stout woman’s chuckle. ‘We’re not in it. We’re the gallery.’
“亲爱的，我们不知道，”艾布拉姆斯夫人说道，脸上带着一种粗壮女人的痉挛般的笑声。 ‘我们不在其中。我们是画廊。

Mr. Dumphry, a tow-headed effeminate young man, remarked: ‘Mama Abrams is a plot in herself,’ and Campion shook his monocle at him, saying: ‘Now, Royal, don’t be too ghastly for words.’ Rosemary looked at them all uncomfortably, wishing her mother had come down here with her. She did not like these people, especially in her immediate comparison of them with those who had interested her at the other end of the beach. Her mother’s modest but compact social gift got them out of unwelcome situations swiftly and firmly. But Rosemary had been a celebrity for only six months, and sometimes the French manners of her early adolescence and the democratic manners of America, these latter superimposed, made a certain confusion and let her in for just such things.
邓弗利先生是一位低头、女性化的年轻人，他评论道：“艾布拉姆斯妈妈本身就是一个阴谋。”坎皮恩对他摇晃着单片眼镜，说道：“好了，罗亚尔，别太可怕了，说不出话来。”不安地看着他们所有人，希望她的母亲能和她一起下来。她不喜欢这些人，尤其是当她立即将他们与海滩另一端那些令她感兴趣的人进行比较时。她母亲谦虚而紧凑的社交天赋让他们迅速而坚定地摆脱了不受欢迎的处境。但罗斯玛丽成为名人仅仅六个月，有时她青春期早期的法国举止和美国的民主举止叠加在一起，造成一定的混乱，让她陷入这样的境地。

Mr. McKisco, a scrawny, freckle-and-red man of thirty, did not find the topic of the ‘plot’ amusing. He had been staring at the sea— now after a swift glance at his wife he turned to Rosemary and demanded aggressively:
麦基斯科先生是一位骨瘦如柴、满脸雀斑、脸色通红的三十岁男子，他并不觉得这个“情节”的话题很有趣。他一直盯着大海——现在快速扫了一眼他的妻子后，他转向罗斯玛丽，咄咄逼人地问道：

‘Been here long?’
“来这里很久了？”

‘Only a day.’
“只有一天。”

‘Oh.’
'哦。'

Evidently feeling that the subject had been thoroughly changed, he looked in turn at the others.
明显感觉话题彻底转移了，他又看向其他人。

‘Going to stay all summer?’ asked Mrs. McKisco, innocently. ‘If you do you can watch the plot unfold.’
“要待上整个夏天吗？”麦基斯科夫人天真地问。 “如果你这样做了，你就可以观看情节的展开。”

‘For God’s sake, Violet, drop the subject!’ exploded her husband. ‘Get a new joke, for God’s sake!’
“看在上帝的份上，维奥莱特，别再说这个话题了！”她的丈夫爆发了。 “看在上帝的份上，开个新笑话吧！”

Mrs. McKisco swayed toward Mrs. Abrams and breathed audibly:
麦基斯科夫人向艾布拉姆斯夫人摇了摇头，呼吸声清晰可闻：

‘He’s nervous.’
“他很紧张。”

‘I’m not nervous,’ disagreed McKisco. ‘It just happens I’m not nervous at all.’
“我并不紧张，”麦基斯科不同意。 “碰巧我一点也不紧张。”

He was burning visibly—a grayish flush had spread over his face, dissolving all his expressions into a vast ineffectuality. Suddenly remotely conscious of his condition he got up to go in the water, followed by his wife, and seizing the opportunity Rosemary followed.
他明显在燃烧——灰色的红晕蔓延到他的脸上，让他所有的表情都消失得无影无踪。突然，他意识到自己的状况，起身准备下水，他的妻子跟在后面，罗斯玛丽也抓住了这个机会。

Mr. McKisco drew a long breath, flung himself into the shallows and began a stiff-armed batting of the Mediterranean, obviously intended to suggest a crawl—his breath exhausted he arose and looked around with an expression of surprise that he was still in sight of shore.
麦基斯科先生长长地吸了一口气，跳进浅滩，开始用僵硬的手臂击打地中海，显然是在暗示要爬行——他气喘吁吁地站起来，环顾四周，脸上露出惊讶的表情，发现自己还在眼前。的岸边。

‘I haven’t learned to breathe yet. I never quite understood how they breathed.’ He looked at Rosemary inquiringly.
‘我还没学会呼吸。我一直不太明白它们是如何呼吸的。”他询问地看着罗斯玛丽。

‘I think you breathe out under water,’ she explained. ‘And every fourth beat you roll your head over for air.’
“我认为你在水下呼吸，”她解释道。 “每四次心跳，你就会转过头来呼吸空气。”

‘The breathing’s the hardest part for me. Shall we go to the raft?’
“呼吸对我来说是最困难的部分。我们要到木筏上去吗？

The man with the leonine head lay stretched out upon the raft, which tipped back and forth with the motion of the water. As Mrs. McKisco reached for it a sudden tilt struck her arm up roughly, whereupon the man started up and pulled her on board.
狮子头男人四肢伸展地躺在木筏上，木筏随着水流的起伏而前后倾斜。当麦基斯科夫人伸手去拿它时，她的手臂突然倾斜，粗暴地抬起来，于是那个男人站了起来，把她拉上了船。

‘I was afraid it hit you.’ His voice was slow and shy; he had one of the saddest faces Rosemary had ever seen, the high cheekbones of an Indian, a long upper lip, and enormous deep-set dark golden eyes. He had spoken out of the side of his mouth, as if he hoped his words would reach Mrs. McKisco by a circuitous and unobtrusive route; in a minute he had shoved off into the water and his long body lay motionless toward shore.
“我担心它会打到你。”他的声音缓慢而害羞。他有着罗斯玛丽所见过的最悲伤的面孔之一，印第安人的高颧骨，长长的上唇，以及深陷的深金色大眼睛。他是从嘴边说出来的，好像他希望自己的话能够通过迂回而不引人注意的途径到达麦基斯科夫人那里；但他并没有这样做。不一会儿，他就被推入水中，修长的身体一动不动地躺在岸边。

Rosemary and Mrs. McKisco watched him. When he had exhausted his momentum he abruptly bent double, his thin thighs rose above the surface, and he disappeared totally, leaving scarcely a fleck of foam behind.
罗斯玛丽和麦基斯科夫人看着他。当他的力气耗尽时，他猛地弯下腰，瘦弱的大腿露出水面，整个人消失得无影无踪，几乎没有留下一滴泡沫。

‘He’s a good swimmer,’ Rosemary said.
“他游泳技术很好，”罗斯玛丽说。

Mrs. McKisco’s answer came with surprising violence.
麦基斯科夫人的回答充满了令人惊讶的暴力。

‘Well, he’s a rotten musician.’ She turned to her husband, who after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climb on the raft, and having attained his balance was trying to make some kind of compensatory flourish, achieving only an extra stagger. ‘I was just saying that Abe North may be a good swimmer but he’s a rotten musician.’
“好吧，他是个糟糕的音乐家。”她转向她的丈夫，在两次失败的尝试之后，他成功地爬上了木筏，并在达到平衡后试图做出某种补偿性的动作，结果只是额外地摇摇欲坠。 “我只是说阿贝·诺斯可能是一名出色的游泳运动员，但他是一个糟糕的音乐家。”

‘Yes,’ agreed McKisco, grudgingly. Obviously he had created his wife’s world, and allowed her few liberties in it.
“是的，”麦基斯科勉强同意。显然，他创造了妻子的世界，并不允许她有多少自由。

‘Antheil’s my man.’ Mrs. McKisco turned challengingly to Rosemary, ‘Anthiel and Joyce. I don’t suppose you ever hear much about those sort of people in Hollywood, but my husband wrote the first criticism of Ulysses that ever appeared in America.’
“安塞尔是我的人。”麦基斯科夫人挑衅地转向罗斯玛丽，“安塞尔和乔伊斯。”我想你在好莱坞很少听说过这类人，但我丈夫写了美国有史以来第一篇对《尤利西斯》的批评。

‘I wish I had a cigarette,’ said McKisco calmly. ‘That’s more important to me just now.’
“我希望有一支烟，”麦基斯科平静地说。 “现在这对我来说更重要。”

‘He’s got insides—don’t you think so, Albert?’
“他有内情——你不这么认为吗，艾伯特？”

Her voice faded off suddenly. The woman of the pearls had joined her two children in the water, and now Abe North came up under one of them like a volcanic island, raising him on his shoulders. The child yelled with fear and delight and the woman watched with a lovely peace, without a smile.
她的声音突然消失了。珍珠女人已经和她的两个孩子一起下水了，现在阿贝·诺斯像一座火山岛一样来到了其中一个孩子的下面，把他扛在肩上。孩子既害怕又高兴地大喊大叫，而女人则平静地看着，没有一丝笑容。

‘Is that his wife?’ Rosemary asked.
“那是他的妻子吗？”罗斯玛丽问道。

‘No, that’s Mrs. Diver. They’re not at the hotel.’ Her eyes, photographic, did not move from the woman’s face. After a moment she turned vehemently to Rosemary.
“不，那是戴弗夫人。”他们不在酒店。”她的目光如摄影般，没有从女人的脸上移开。过了一会儿，她猛烈地转向罗斯玛丽。

‘Have you been abroad before?’
“你以前出过国吗？”

‘Yes—I went to school in Paris.’
“是的——我在巴黎上学。”

‘Oh! Well then you probably know that if you want to enjoy yourself here the thing is to get to know some real French families. What do these people get out of it?’ She pointed her left shoulder toward shore. ‘They just stick around with each other in little cliques. Of course, we had letters of introduction and met all the best French artists and writers in Paris. That made it very nice.’
'哦！那么您可能知道，如果您想在这里过得愉快，就必须了解一些真正的法国家庭。这些人能从中得到什么？”她将左肩指向岸边。 “他们只是结成小团体，互相粘在一起。当然，我们有介绍信，并在巴黎见到了所有最好的法国艺术家和作家。这使得它非常好。

‘I should think so.’
“我应该这么认为。”

‘My husband is finishing his first novel, you see.’
“你看，我丈夫正在完成他的第一部小说。”

Rosemary said: ‘Oh, he is?’ She was not thinking anything special, except wondering whether her mother had got to sleep in this heat.
罗斯玛丽说：“哦，他是？”她并没有想什么特别的事情，只是想知道她的母亲是否必须在这么热的天气里睡觉。

‘It’s on the idea of Ulysses,’ continued Mrs. McKisco. ‘Only instead of taking twenty-four hours my husband takes a hundred years. He takes a decayed old French aristocrat and puts him in contrast with the mechanical age—‘
“这是根据尤利西斯的想法，”麦基斯科夫人继续说道。 “只是我丈夫不用二十四小时，而是用了一百年。他以一位腐朽的法国老贵族为对象，将他与机械时代进行对比——“

‘Oh, for God’s sake, Violet, don’t go telling everybody the idea,’ protested McKisco. ‘I don’t want it to get all around before the book’s published.’
“哦，看在上帝的份上，维奥莱特，别把这个想法告诉所有人，”麦基斯科抗议道。 “我不希望这件事在这本书出版之前就流传开来。”

Rosemary swam back to the shore, where she threw her peignoir over her already sore shoulders and lay down again in the sun. The man with the jockey cap was now going from umbrella to umbrella carrying a bottle and little glasses in his hands; presently he and his friends grew livelier and closer together and now they were all under a single assemblage of umbrellas—she gathered that some one was leaving and that this was a last drink on the beach. Even the children knew that excitement was generating under that umbrella and turned toward it—and it seemed to Rosemary that it all came from the man in the jockey cap.
迷迭香游回岸边，把她的佩尼诺披在她已经酸痛的肩膀上，然后又躺在阳光下。那个戴着骑师帽的男人手里拿着一个瓶子和一个小眼镜，从一把伞走到另一把伞。不久，他和他的朋友们变得更加活跃，关系更加亲密，现在他们都在同一把伞下——她推测有人要离开，这是海滩上的最后一杯酒了。就连孩子们也知道那把伞下正在产生兴奋，并转向它——在罗斯玛丽看来，这一切都来自那个戴着骑师帽的男人。

Noon dominated sea and sky—even the white line of Cannes, five miles off, had faded to a mirage of what was fresh and cool; a robin-breasted sailing boat pulled in behind it a strand from the outer, darker sea. It seemed that there was no life anywhere in all this expanse of coast except under the filtered sunlight of those umbrellas, where something went on amid the color and the murmur.
正午主宰着大海和天空——就连五英里外戛纳的白线也褪成了清新凉爽的海市蜃楼；一艘知更鸟胸的帆船在它身后拉着一条来自外海、黑暗的大海的线。除了那些遮阳伞过滤的阳光下，这片广阔的海岸上似乎没有任何生机，那里的颜色和杂音中发生着一些事情。

Campion walked near her, stood a few feet away and Rosemary closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then she half-opened them and watched two dim, blurred pillars that were legs. The man tried to edge his way into a sand-colored cloud, but the cloud floated off into the vast hot sky. Rosemary fell really asleep.
坎皮恩走到她身边，站在几英尺远的地方，罗斯玛丽闭上眼睛，假装睡着了。然后她半睁开眼睛，看到两根昏暗、模糊的柱子，那是腿。那人试图挤进一朵沙色的云中，但云却飘进了广阔炎热的天空。迷迭香真的睡着了。

She awoke drenched with sweat to find the beach deserted save for the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last umbrella. As Rosemary lay blinking, he walked nearer and said:
她醒来时浑身是汗，发现海滩上空无一人，只有那个戴骑师帽的男人正在折叠最后一把雨伞。当罗斯玛丽眨着眼睛躺着时，他走近说道：

‘I was going to wake you before I left. It’s not good to get too burned right away.’
“我本来想在离开之前叫醒你的。马上就被烧得太厉害是不好的。

‘Thank you.’ Rosemary looked down at her crimson legs.
“谢谢。”罗斯玛丽低头看着自己猩红的双腿。

‘Heavens!’
'天！'

She laughed cheerfully, inviting him to talk, but Dick Diver was already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up to a waiting car, so she went into the water to wash off the sweat. He came back and gathering up a rake, a shovel, and a sieve, stowed them in a crevice of a rock. He glanced up and down the beach to see if he had left anything.
她欢快地笑起来，邀请他说话，但迪克·戴弗已经拿着帐篷和遮阳伞走向等候的汽车，所以她下水洗掉汗水。他回来后，捡起一把耙子、一把铲子和一个筛子，把它们藏在岩石的缝隙里。他在海滩上上下扫视了一下，看看有没有留下什么东西。

‘Do you know what time it is?’ Rosemary asked.
“你知道现在几点了吗？”罗斯玛丽问道。

‘It’s about half-past one.’
“大约一点半了。”

They faced the seascape together momentarily.
他们暂时一起面向海景。

‘It’s not a bad time,’ said Dick Diver. ‘It’s not one of worst times of the day.’
“现在还不错，”迪克·戴弗说。 “这还不是一天中最糟糕的时刻之一。”

He looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright blue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently. Then he shouldered his last piece of junk and went up to his car, and Rosemary came out of the water, shook out her peignoir and walked up to the hotel.
他看着她，有那么一刻，她生活在他眼睛里明亮的蓝色世界里，充满渴望和自信。然后他扛起最后一块垃圾，走上自己的车，罗斯玛丽从水里出来，甩掉身上的佩尼诺，朝酒店走去。

三、

It was almost two when they went into the dining-room. Back and forth over the deserted tables a heavy pattern of beams and shadows swayed with the motion of the pines outside. Two waiters, piling plates and talking loud Italian, fell silent when they came in and brought them a tired version of the table d’hôte luncheon.
他们走进餐厅时已经快两点了。一道道沉重的光束和阴影随着外面松树的摇曳，在空荡荡的桌子上来回晃动。两名服务员一边堆着盘子，一边大声讲着意大利语，当他们进来给他们端来一份陈旧的套餐午餐时，他们陷入了沉默。

‘I fell in love on the beach,’ said Rosemary.
“我爱上了海滩，”罗斯玛丽说。

‘Who with?’
'谁与？'

‘First with a whole lot of people who looked nice. Then with one man.’
“首先是有很多看起来不错的人。然后和一个人在一起。

‘Did you talk to him?’
“你跟他说话了吗？”

‘Just a little. Very handsome. With reddish hair.’ She was eating, ravenously. ‘He’s married though—it’s usually the way.’
‘就一点点。很英俊。头发微红。”她狼吞虎咽地吃着。 “不过他已经结婚了——通常都是这样。”

Her mother was her best friend and had put every last possibility into the guiding of her, not so rare a thing in the theatrical profession, but rather special in that Mrs. Elsie Speers was not recompensing herself for a defeat of her own. She had no personal bitterness or resentments about life—twice satisfactorily married and twice widowed, her cheerful stoicism had each time deepened. One of her husbands had been a cavalry officer and one an army doctor, and they both left something to her that she tried to present intact to Rosemary. By not sparing Rosemary she had made her hard—by not sparing her own labor and devotion she had cultivated an idealism in Rosemary, which at present was directed toward herself and saw the world through her eyes. So that while Rosemary was a ‘simple’ child she was protected by a double sheath of her mother’s armor and her own—she had a mature distrust of the trivial, the facile and the vulgar. However, with Rosemary’s sudden success in pictures Mrs. Speers felt that it was time she were spiritually weaned; it would please rather than pain her if this somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would focus on something except herself.
她的母亲是她最好的朋友，并尽一切可能来指导她，这在戏剧界并不罕见，但相当特别的是，埃尔西·斯皮尔斯夫人并没有因为自己的失败而补偿自己。她对生活没有任何个人的痛苦或怨恨——两次美满的婚姻和两次丧偶，她快乐的坚忍精神每次都加深。她的一位丈夫是一名骑兵军官，一位是军医，他们都给她留下了一些东西，她试图将这些东西原封不动地呈现给罗斯玛丽。由于不吝惜罗斯玛丽，她使她变得坚强——通过不吝惜自己的劳动和奉献，她在罗斯玛丽身上培养了一种理想主义，这种理想主义目前是针对她自己的，并通过她的眼睛看世界。因此，虽然罗斯玛丽是一个“简单”的孩子，但她受到母亲和她自己的双重盔甲的保护——她对琐碎、轻率和粗俗有着成熟的不信任。然而，随着罗斯玛丽在影视界的突然成功，斯皮尔斯夫人觉得是时候在精神上断奶了。如果这种有点跳跃、气喘吁吁、迫切的理想主义把注意力集中在除她自己之外的其他事情上，她会感到高兴而不是痛苦。

‘Then you like it here?’ she asked.
“那你喜欢这里吗？”她问道。

‘It might be fun if we knew those people. There were some other people, but they weren’t nice. They recognized me—no matter where we go everybody’s seen ‘Daddy’s Girl.’’
“如果我们认识那些人，那可能会很有趣。还有其他一些人，但他们并不友善。他们认出了我——无论我们走到哪里，每个人都看到了《爸爸的女儿》。”

Mrs. Speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside; then she said in a matter-of-fact way: ‘That reminds me, when are you going to see Earl Brady?’
斯皮尔斯夫人等待着自我中心的光芒消退。然后她就实事求是地说：“这让我想起了，你什么时候要去见厄尔·布雷迪？”

‘I thought we might go this afternoon—if you’re rested.’
“我想我们今天下午可以去——如果你休息的话。”

‘You go—I’m not going.’
“你走——我不走。”

‘We’ll wait till to-morrow then.’
“那我们就等到明天吧。”

‘I want you to go alone. It’s only a short way—it isn’t as if you didn’t speak French.’
‘我要你一个人去。这只是一条很短的路——你又不是不会说法语。”

‘Mother—aren’t there some things I don’t have to do?’
“妈妈——是不是有些事情我不必做？”

‘Oh, well then go later—but some day before we leave.’
“哦，好吧，那就晚点去吧——但要在我们离开之前的某一天。”

‘All right, Mother.’
“好吧，妈妈。”

After lunch they were both overwhelmed by the sudden flatness that comes over American travellers in quiet foreign places. No stimuli worked upon them, no voices called them from without, no fragments of their own thoughts came suddenly from the minds of others, and missing the clamor of Empire they felt that life was not continuing here.
午餐后，他们都被美国游客在安静的异国他乡突然出现的平淡感所淹没。没有任何刺激作用在他们身上，没有来自外界的声音召唤他们，没有任何自己的思想碎片突然从别人的脑海中冒出来，错过了帝国的喧嚣，他们觉得生活在这里不再继续。

‘Let’s only stay three days, Mother,’ Rosemary said when they were back in their rooms. Outside a light wind blew the heat around, straining it through the trees and sending little hot gusts through the shutters.
“我们只待三天吧，妈妈，”当他们回到自己的房间时，罗斯玛丽说道。外面一阵微风吹过周围的热量，将热量吹过树林，并从百叶窗中吹进阵阵热风。

‘How about the man you fell in love with on the beach?’
“你在海滩上爱上的那个男人怎么样？”

‘I don’t love anybody but you, Mother, darling.’
“除了你，我不爱任何人，妈妈，亲爱的。”

Rosemary stopped in the lobby and spoke to Gausse père about trains. The concierge, lounging in light-brown khaki by the desk, stared at her rigidly, then suddenly remembered the manners of his métier. She took the bus and rode with a pair of obsequious waiters to the station, embarrassed by their deferential silence, wanting to urge them: ‘Go on, talk, enjoy yourselves. It doesn’t bother me.’
罗斯玛丽在大厅停下来，和高斯神父谈论火车。身着浅棕色卡其色衣服的礼宾员懒洋洋地躺在办公桌旁，目光僵硬地盯着她，然后突然想起了自己的职业礼仪。她坐上公交车，和两个阿谀奉承的服务员一起来到了车站，她们的恭敬沉默令她感到尴尬，她想催促他们：“继续说吧，玩得开心。”这并不困扰我。

The first-class compartment was stifling; the vivid advertising cards of the railroad companies—The Pont du Gard at Arles, the Amphitheatre at Orange, winter sports at Chamonix—were fresher than the long motionless sea outside. Unlike American trains that were absorbed in an intense destiny of their own, and scornful of people on another world less swift and breathless, this train was part of the country through which it passed. Its breath stirred the dust from the palm leaves, the cinders mingled with the dry dung in the gardens. Rosemary was sure she could lean from the window and pull flowers with her hand.
头等舱很闷；铁路公司生动的广告牌——阿尔勒的加尔桥、奥兰治的露天剧场、霞慕尼的冬季运动——比外面漫长静止的大海还要清新。与美国的火车不同，美国的火车全神贯注于自己的强烈命运，并且蔑视另一个世界上不那么迅速和喘不过气来的人们，这列火车是它所经过的国家的一部分。它的呼吸搅动了棕榈叶上的灰尘，煤渣与花园里的干粪混合在一起。罗斯玛丽确信她可以靠在窗户上用手拉花。

A dozen cabbies slept in their hacks outside the Cannes station. Over on the promenade the Casino, the smart shops, and the great hotels turned blank iron masks to the summer sea. It was unbelievable that there could ever have been a ‘season,’ and Rosemary, half in the grip of fashion, became a little selfconscious, as though she were displaying an unhealthy taste for the moribund; as though people were wondering why she was here in the lull between the gaiety of last winter and next winter, while up north the true world thundered by.
十几个出租车司机睡在戛纳车站外的小屋里。在海滨长廊上，赌场、时尚的商店和大酒店把空白的铁面具变成了夏日的大海。令人难以置信的是，竟然会有一个“季节”，而迷迭香，一半被时尚所掌控，变得有点不自在，仿佛她对垂死的人表现出了一种不健康的品味；仿佛人们想知道为什么她在去年冬天和明年冬天的欢乐之间的平静中来到这里，而北方的真实世界却轰鸣而过。

As she came out of a drug store with a bottle of cocoanut oil, a woman, whom she recognized as Mrs. Diver, crossed her path with arms full of sofa cushions, and went to a car parked down the street. A long, low black dog barked at her, a dozing chauffeur woke with a start. She sat in the car, her lovely face set, controlled, her eyes brave and watchful, looking straight ahead toward nothing. Her dress was bright red and her brown legs were bare. She had thick, dark, gold hair like a chow’s.
当她拿着一瓶椰子油从一家药店出来时，一位她认出是戴弗太太的女士抱着满是沙发垫的人从她面前走过，走向停在街边的一辆汽车。一只又长又低的黑狗对她狂吠，一位正在打瞌睡的司机惊醒了。她坐在车里，可爱的脸沉着，镇定自若，眼睛勇敢而警觉，直视前方，看不到任何东西。她的衣服是鲜红色的，棕色的腿裸露着。她有一头浓密的、深色的、金色的头发，就像松狮犬的头发一样。

With half an hour to wait for her train Rosemary sat down in the Café des Alliés on the Croisette, where the trees made a green twilight over the tables and an orchestra wooed an imaginary public of cosmopolites with the Nice Carnival Song and last year’s American tune. She had bought Le Temps and The Saturday Evening Post for her mother, and as she drank her citronade she opened the latter at the memoirs of a Russian princess, finding the dim conventions of the nineties realer and nearer than the headlines of the French paper. It was the same feeling that had oppressed her at the hotel—accustomed to seeing the starkest grotesqueries of a continent heavily underlined as comedy or tragedy, untrained to the task of separating out the essential for herself, she now began to feel that French life was empty and stale. This feeling was surcharged by listening to the sad tunes of the orchestra, reminiscent of the melancholy music played for acrobats in vaudeville. She was glad to go back to Gausse’s Hotel.
等待火车的时间还有半个小时，罗斯玛丽在海滨大道的艾利咖啡馆坐了下来，那里的树木在桌子上投射出绿色的暮色，管弦乐队用优美的嘉年华歌曲和去年的美国曲调吸引着想象中的国际化公众。 。她给母亲买了《时光报》和《周六晚邮报》，当她喝着柠檬水时，她打开后者，翻阅一位俄罗斯公主的回忆录，发现九十年代的阴暗惯例比法国报纸的头条新闻更真实、更贴近。这种感觉在酒店里也曾让她感到压抑——她习惯了把欧洲大陆上最荒唐的怪诞事件都强调为喜剧或悲剧，没有受过训练，无法为自己分离出本质，现在她开始觉得法国生活是空虚且陈旧。聆听管弦乐队悲伤的曲调，这种感觉更加强烈，让人想起杂耍杂技演员演奏的忧郁音乐。她很高兴回到高斯旅馆。

Her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next day, so she and her mother hired a car—after much haggling, for Rosemary had formed her valuations of money in France—and drove along the Riviera, the delta of many rivers. The chauffeur, a Russian Czar of the period of Ivan the Terrible, was a self-appointed guide, and the resplendent names—Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo—began to glow through their torpid camouflage, whispering of old kings come here to dine or die, of rajahs tossing Buddha’s eyes to English ballerinas, of Russian princes turning the weeks into Baltic twilights in the lost caviare days. Most of all, there was the scent of the Russians along the coast—their closed book shops and grocery stores. Ten years ago, when the season ended in April, the doors of the Orthodox Church were locked, and the sweet champagnes they favored were put away until their return. ‘We’ll be back next season,’ they said, but this was premature, for they were never coming back any more.
她的肩膀太烧伤，第二天无法游泳，所以她和母亲在一番讨价还价之后租了一辆车，因为罗斯玛丽已经形成了她对法国金钱的估价——沿着里维埃拉——许多河流的三角洲行驶。司机是伊凡雷帝时期的俄罗斯沙皇，他自封为导游，那些辉煌的名字——戛纳、尼斯、蒙特卡洛——开始透过它们迟钝的伪装发光，窃窃私语着老国王来这里吃饭或死亡，王公将佛眼抛给英国芭蕾舞演员，俄罗斯王子将几周变成了失去鱼子酱时代的波罗的海黄昏。最重要的是，沿海地区弥漫着俄罗斯人的气息——他们关门的书店和杂货店。十年前，四月季节结束时，东正教教堂的大门紧锁，他们喜爱的甜香槟被收起来，直到他们回来。他们说，“我们下赛季会回来”，但现在还为时过早，因为他们再也不会回来了。

It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon, above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates and cornelians of childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry water, wine dark. It was pleasant to pass people eating outside their doors, and to hear the fierce mechanical pianos behind the vines of country estaminets. When they turned off the Corniche d’Or and down to Gausse’s Hotel through the darkening banks of trees, set one behind another in many greens, the moon already hovered over the ruins of the aqueducts... .
下午晚些时候开车返回酒店是件令人愉快的事，海面的颜色像童年的玛瑙和红玉髓一样神秘，绿得像绿牛奶，蓝得像洗衣水，酒色深。路过在门外吃饭的人们，听到乡村庄园的藤蔓后面激烈的机械钢琴声，真是令人愉快。当他们驶出金滨大道，穿过昏暗的树林，一棵树接一棵地被绿树环绕，来到高斯旅馆时，月亮已经盘旋在渡槽的废墟上空……

Somewhere in the hills behind the hotel there was a dance, and Rosemary listened to the music through the ghostly moonshine of her mosquito net, realizing that there was gaiety too somewhere about, and she thought of the nice people on the beach. She thought she might meet them in the morning, but they obviously formed a selfsufficient little group, and once their umbrellas, bamboo rugs, dogs, and children were set out in place the part of the plage was literally fenced in. She resolved in any case not to spend her last two mornings with the other ones.
酒店后面山上的某个地方正在举行一场舞会，罗斯玛丽透过蚊帐幽灵般的月光听着音乐，意识到周围也有欢乐的地方，她想起了海滩上的好人们。她以为她可能会在早上见到他们，但他们显然形成了一个自给自足的小团体，一旦他们的雨伞、竹毯、狗和孩子都摆放到位，海滩的一部分实际上就被栅栏围起来了。她不想和其他人一起度过最后两个早晨。

IV

The matter was solved for her. The McKiscos were not yet there and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two men—the man with the jockey cap and the tall blonde man, given to sawing waiters in two— left the group and came down toward her.
这件事已经为她解决了。麦基斯科夫妇还没有到，她刚刚展开她的佩尼诺尔，两个男人——戴着骑师帽的男人和习惯把侍者锯成两半的高个子金发男人——离开了人群，朝她走来。

‘Good morning,’ said Dick Diver. He broke down. ‘Look—sunburn or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday? We worried about you.’
“早上好，”迪克·戴弗说。他崩溃了。 “看——晒伤或没有晒伤，你昨天为什么没有离开？我们很担心你。

She sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their intrusion.
她坐了起来，开心的小笑声欢迎他们的闯入。

‘We wondered,’ Dick Diver said, ‘if you wouldn’t come over this morning. We go in, we take food and drink, so it’s a substantial invitation.’
“我们想知道，”迪克·戴弗说，“你今天早上是否不来。”我们进去，带食物和饮料，所以这是一个很重要的邀请。”

He seemed kind and charming—his voice promised that he would take care of her, and that a little later he would open up whole new worlds for her, unroll an endless succession of magnificent possibilities. He managed the introduction so that her name wasn’t mentioned and then let her know easily that everyone knew who she was but were respecting the completeness of her private life—a courtesy that Rosemary had not met with save from professional people since her success.
他看起来友善又迷人——他的声音​​承诺他会照顾她，不久之后他就会为她打开全新的世界，展开无穷无尽的壮丽可能性。他设法在介绍中不提及她的名字，然后让她很容易地知道，每个人都知道她是谁，但尊重她私人生活的完整性——自罗斯玛丽成功以来，除了专业人士之外，从未见过这种礼貌。

Nicole Diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls, was looking through a recipe book for chicken Maryland. She was about twentyfour, Rosemary guessed—her face could have been described in terms of conventional prettiness, but the effect was that it had been made first on the heroic scale with strong structure and marking, as if the features and vividness of brow and coloring, everything we associate with temperament and character had been molded with a Rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the direction of prettiness to a point where a single slip would have irreparably diminished its force and quality. With the mouth the sculptor had taken desperate chances—it was the cupid’s bow of a magazine cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest.
妮可·戴弗（Nicole Diver），棕色的后背挂在珍珠上，正在翻阅一本马里兰鸡的食谱书。罗斯玛丽猜测，她大约二十四岁——她的脸可以用传统的美丽来形容，但效果是，它首先是在英雄规模上制作的，具有强烈的结构和标记，仿佛眉毛和颜色的特征和生动，我们所联想到的气质和性格的一切都是以罗丁式的意图塑造的，然后朝着漂亮的方向凿刻，以至于一个失误就会无可挽回地削弱它的力量和质量。雕塑家用嘴抓住了绝望的机会——它是杂志封面上的丘比特之弓，但它与其他人有着同样的区别。

‘Are you here for a long time?’ Nicole asked. Her voice was low, almost harsh.
“你在这里待了很长时间吗？”妮可问。她的声音低沉，近乎刺耳。

Suddenly Rosemary let the possibility enter her mind that they might stay another week.
突然，罗斯玛丽想到了他们可能会再待一周的可能性。

‘Not very long,’ she answered vaguely. ‘We’ve been abroad a long time—we landed in Sicily in March and we’ve been slowly working our way north. I got pneumonia making a picture last January and I’ve been recuperating.’
“不会很久，”她含糊地回答。 “我们已经出国很长时间了——三月份我们在西西里岛登陆，我们一直在慢慢地向北行驶。去年一月，我在拍照片时得了肺炎，目前正在康复中。”

‘Mercy! How did that happen?’
'怜悯！那是怎么发生的？'

‘Well, it was from swimming,’ Rosemary was rather reluctant at embarking upon personal revelations. ‘One day I happened to have the grippe and didn’t know it, and they were taking a scene where I dove into a canal in Venice. It was a very expensive set, so I had to dive and dive and dive all morning. Mother had a doctor right there, but it was no use—I got pneumonia.’ She changed the subject determinedly before they could speak. ‘Do you like it here—this place?’
“嗯，是游泳造成的，”罗斯玛丽不太愿意透露个人的情况。 “有一天，我碰巧得了流行性感冒，但我并不知道，他们正在拍摄我跳进威尼斯运河的场景。这是一套非常昂贵的套装，所以我整个早上都必须潜水、潜水、潜水。母亲就在那里找了医生，但没有用——我得了肺炎。”在他们说话之前，她果断地改变了话题。 “你喜欢这里——这个地方吗？”

‘They have to like it,’ said Abe North slowly. ‘They invented it.’ He turned his noble head slowly so that his eyes rested with tenderness and affection on the two Divers.
“他们一定喜欢它，”阿贝·诺斯慢慢地说。 “他们发明了它。”他慢慢地转过高贵的头，目光温柔而深情地落在两个潜水员身上。

‘Oh, did you?’
“哦，是吗？”

‘This is only the second season that the hotel’s been open in summer,’ Nicole explained. ‘We persuaded Gausse to keep on a cook and a garçon and a chasseur—it paid its way and this year it’s doing even better.’
“这只是酒店夏季营业的第二个季节，”妮可解释道。 “我们说服高斯继续聘用一名厨师、一名猎手和一名猎手——这一切都得到了回报，而且今年做得更好。”

‘But you’re not in the hotel.’
“但你不在酒店。”

‘We built a house, up at Tarmes.’
“我们在塔尔梅斯建了一座房子。”

‘The theory is,’ said Dick, arranging an umbrella to clip a square of sunlight off Rosemary’s shoulder, ‘that all the northern places, like Deauville, were picked out by Russians and English who don’t mind the cold, while half of us Americans come from tropical climates—that’s why we’re beginning to come here.’
“理论上来说，”迪克一边说，一边撑起一把雨伞，为罗斯玛丽的肩膀遮去一角阳光，“所有北方地方，比如多维尔，都被不介意寒冷的俄罗斯人和英国人挑选出来，而一半的北方地区，比如多维尔，都被不介意寒冷的俄罗斯人和英国人选中了。”我们美国人来自热带气候——这就是我们开始来到这里的原因。”

The young man of Latin aspect had been turning the pages of The New York Herald.
这位拉丁裔年轻人正在翻阅《纽约先驱报》。

‘Well, what nationality are these people?’ he demanded, suddenly, and read with a slight French intonation, ‘‘Registered at the Hotel Palace at Vevey are Mr. Pandely Vlasco, Mme. Bonneasse’—I don’t exaggerate—‘Corinna Medonca, Mme. Pasche, Seraphim Tullio, Maria Amalia Roto Mais, Moises Teubel, Mme. Paragoris, Apostle Alexandre, Yolanda Yosfuglu and Geneveva de Momus!’ She attracts me most— Geneveva de Momus. Almost worth running up to Vevey to take a look at Geneveva de Momus.’
“那么，这些人是什么国籍？”他突然问道，并用轻微的法语语调读道，“在沃韦皇宫酒店登记的是潘德利·弗拉斯科先生、潘德利·弗拉斯科女士。”博尼斯”——我并不夸张——“科琳娜·梅东卡，夫人。塞拉芬·图利奥 (Seraphim Tullio) 帕什 (Pasche)、玛丽亚·阿玛莉亚·罗托·迈斯 (Maria Amalia Roto Mais)、莫伊塞斯·托贝尔 (Moises Teubel) 女士。帕拉戈里斯、使徒亚历山大、约兰达·约斯福格鲁和日内瓦·德·莫姆斯！”她最吸引我的是日内瓦·德·莫姆斯。几乎值得跑去沃韦看看日内瓦德莫穆斯。

He stood up with sudden restlessness, stretching himself with one sharp movement. He was a few years younger than Diver or North. He was tall and his body was hard but overspare save for the bunched force gathered in his shoulders and upper arms. At first glance he seemed conventionally handsome—but there was a faint disgust always in his face which marred the full fierce lustre of his brown eyes. Yet one remembered them afterward, when one had forgotten the inability of the mouth to endure boredom and the young forehead with its furrows of fretful and unprofitable pain.
他突然不安地站了起来，猛地伸了个懒腰。他比戴弗或诺斯小几岁。他身材高大，身体坚硬，但除了肩膀和上臂聚集的力量外，他的身体有些多余。乍一看，他看上去很英俊——但他的脸上总是带着一丝厌恶，破坏了他棕色眼睛的凶光。然而，当人们忘记了嘴巴无力忍受无聊，忘记了年轻的额头因烦躁而无益的疼痛而皱起的皱纹时，人们事后仍记得它们。

‘We found some fine ones in the news of Americans last week,’ said Nicole. ‘Mrs. Evelyn Oyster and—what were the others?’
“我们上周在美国新闻中发现了一些不错的新闻，”妮可说。 '太太。伊芙琳牡蛎还有——其他的是什么？

‘There was Mr. S. Flesh,’ said Diver, getting up also. He took his rake and began to work seriously at getting small stones out of the sand.
“S.弗莱什先生在那儿，”戴弗说着也站了起来。他拿起耙子，开始认真地从沙子里取出小石子。

‘Oh, yes—S. Flesh—doesn’t he give you the creeps?’
“哦，是的——S。肉体——他不会让你感到毛骨悚然吗？

It was quiet alone with Nicole—Rosemary found it even quieter than with her mother. Abe North and Barban, the Frenchman, were talking about Morocco, and Nicole having copied her recipe picked up a piece of sewing. Rosemary examined their appurtenances—four large parasols that made a canopy of shade, a portable bath house for dressing, a pneumatic rubber horse, new things that Rosemary had never seen, from the first burst of luxury manufacturing after the War, and probably in the hands of the first of purchasers. She had gathered that they were fashionable people, but though her mother had brought her up to beware such people as drones, she did not feel that way here. Even in their absolute immobility, complete as that of the morning, she felt a purpose, a working over something, a direction, an act of creation different from any she had known. Her immature mind made no speculations upon the nature of their relation to each other, she was only concerned with their attitude toward herself—but she perceived the web of some pleasant interrelation, which she expressed with the thought that they seemed to have a very good time.
单独和妮可在一起很安静——罗斯玛丽发现比和她母亲在一起更安静。阿贝·诺斯（Abe North）和法国人巴尔班（Barban）正在谈论摩洛哥，妮可（Nicole）抄了她的食谱，拿起了一块缝纫品。罗斯玛丽检查了他们的附属物——四把大遮阳伞，可以遮荫，一个可以换衣服的便携式浴室，一匹充气橡皮马，这些都是罗斯玛丽从未见过的新东西，来自战后奢侈品制造业的第一次爆发，​​很可能是在第一个购买者的手中。她猜想他们都是时尚人士，虽然她母亲从小就教育她要提防无人机这种人，但在这里她却没有这种感觉。即使他们完全一动不动，就像早晨一样，她也感觉到了一个目标，一种对某事的努力，一个方向，一种不同于她所知道的任何创造的行为。她不成熟的头脑没有思考他们彼此关系的本质，她只关心他们对自己的态度——但她察觉到了某种令人愉快的相互关系，她表达了这样的想法：他们似乎有很好的关系。时间。

She looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriating them. All three were personable in different ways; all were of a special gentleness that she felt was part of their lives, past and future, not circumstanced by events, not at all like the company manners of actors, and she detected also a far-reaching delicacy that was different from the rough and ready good fellowship of directors, who represented the intellectuals in her life. Actors and directors—those were the only men she had ever known, those and the heterogeneous, indistinguishable mass of college boys, interested only in love at first sight, whom she had met at the Yale prom last fall.
她依次看向三人，暂时征用了他们。这三个人都以不同的方式表现得风度翩翩。他们都带着一种特殊的温柔，她觉得这是他们生活的一部分，过去的和未来的，不为事件所左右，一点也不像演员的公司礼仪，她还发现了一种不同于粗暴的微妙。准备好与她生活中代表知识分子的董事们建立良好的友谊。演员和导演——他们是她唯一认识的男人，还有那些异质的、难以区分的、只对一见钟情感兴趣的大学男生，他们是她去年秋天在耶鲁大学舞会上认识的。

These three were different. Barban was less civilized, more skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even perfunctory. Abe North had, under his shyness, a desperate humor that amused but puzzled her. Her serious nature distrusted its ability to make a supreme impression on him.
这三个人是不同的。巴尔班不太文明，更多的是怀疑和嘲讽，他的举止很正式，甚至有些敷衍。阿贝·诺斯在害羞之下有一种绝望的幽默感，这让她感到有趣但又困惑。她严肃的性格不相信她能给他留下深刻印象的能力。

But Dick Diver—he was all complete there. Silently she admired him. His complexion was reddish and weather-burned, so was his short hair—a light growth of it rolled down his arms and hands. His eyes were of a bright, hard blue. His nose was somewhat pointed and there was never any doubt at whom he was looking or talking—and this is a flattering attention, for who looks at us?— glances fall upon us, curious or disinterested, nothing more. His voice, with some faint Irish melody running through it, wooed the world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control and of self-discipline, her own virtues. Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head saw her choose him, heard the little sigh at the fact that he was already possessed.
但迪克·戴弗——他在那里一切都很完整。她默默地欣赏他。他的脸色微红，饱经风霜，他的短发也是如此——浅浅的头发顺着他的手臂和双手垂下来。他的眼睛是明亮、坚硬的蓝色。他的鼻子有点尖，毫无疑问他在看谁或在说话——这是一种讨人喜欢的关注，因为谁在看我们？——目光落在我们身上，好奇的或不感兴趣的，仅此而已。他的声音里带着淡淡的爱尔兰旋律，吸引着全世界，但她却感受到了他身上的坚韧、自我控制和自律，以及她自己的美德。哦，她选择了他，妮可抬起头，看到她选择了他，听到他因他已经被附身而发出的轻微叹息。

Toward noon the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Signor Campion came on the beach. They had brought a new umbrella that they set up with side glances toward the Divers, and crept under with satisfied expressions—all save Mr. McKisco, who remained derisively without. In his raking Dick had passed near them and now he returned to the umbrellas.
中午时分，麦基斯科夫妇、艾布拉姆斯夫人、邓弗里先生和坎皮恩先生来到了海滩。他们带来了一把新伞，侧视着戴弗夫妇，撑起伞，带着满意的表情爬到伞下——除了麦基斯科先生，他仍然嘲笑地没有伞。迪克用耙子从他们身边经过，现在又回到了雨伞旁。

‘The two young men are reading the Book of Etiquette together,’ he said in a low voice.
“两位年轻人正在一起读《礼记》。”他低声说道。

‘Planning to mix wit de quality,’ said Abe.
“计划将品质与质量结合起来，”安倍说。

Mary North, the very tanned young woman whom Rosemary had encountered the first day on the raft, came in from swimming and said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:
玛丽·诺斯，罗斯玛丽第一天在木筏上遇到的那个晒得黝黑的年轻女子，她游完泳回来，带着一丝潇洒的微笑说道：

‘So Mr. and Mrs. Neverquiver have arrived.’
“所以内弗基弗先生和夫人已经到了。”

‘They’re this man’s friends,’ Nicole reminded her, indicating Abe. ‘Why doesn’t he go and speak to them? Don’t you think they’re attractive?’
“他们是这个人的朋友，”妮可提醒她，指着阿贝。 ‘他为什么不去跟他们说话呢？你不觉得它们很有吸引力吗？

‘I think they’re very attractive,’ Abe agreed. ‘I just don’t think they’re attractive, that’s all.’
“我认为它们非常有吸引力，”安倍同意道。 “我只是觉得它们没有吸引力，仅此而已。”

‘Well, I HAVE felt there were too many people on the beach this summer,’ Nicole admitted. ‘OUR beach that Dick made out of a pebble pile.’ She considered, and then lowering her voice out of the range of the trio of nannies who sat back under another umbrella. ‘Still, they’re preferable to those British last summer who kept shouting about: ‘Isn’t the sea blue? Isn’t the sky white? Isn’t little Nellie’s nose red?’’
“嗯，我觉得今年夏天海滩上的人太多了，”妮可承认。 “我们的海滩是迪克用鹅卵石堆砌成的。”她想了想，然后压低声音，避开坐在另一把伞下的三个保姆的声音范围。 “尽管如此，他们还是比去年夏天那些不断喊叫的英国人要好：‘海不是蓝色的吗？天空不是白色的吗？小内莉的鼻子不是红的吗？

Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole for an enemy.
罗斯玛丽认为她不喜欢妮可成为敌人。

‘But you didn’t see the fight,’ Nicole continued. ‘The day before you came, the married man, the one with the name that sounds like a substitute for gasoline or butter—‘
“但你没有看到战斗，”妮可继续说道。 “你来的前一天，那个已婚男人，名字听起来像是汽油或黄油的替代品——”

‘McKisco?’
“麦基斯科？”

‘Yes—well they were having words and she tossed some sand in his face. So naturally he sat on top of her and rubbed her face in the sand. We were—electrified. I wanted Dick to interfere.’
“是的——好吧，他们正在说话，她把一些沙子扔到了他脸上。他很自然地坐在她身上，用沙子擦她的脸。我们——触电了。我希望迪克介入。

‘I think,’ said Dick Diver, staring down abstractedly at the straw mat, ‘that I’ll go over and invite them to dinner.’
“我想，”迪克·戴弗心不在焉地低头看着草席，说道，“我应该过去邀请他们吃晚饭。”

‘No, you won’t,’ Nicole told him quickly.
“不，你不会的，”妮可很快告诉他。

‘I think it would be a very good thing. They’re here—let’s adjust ourselves.’
“我认为这将是一件非常好的事情。他们在这里——让我们调整一下自己。

‘We’re very well adjusted,’ she insisted, laughing. ‘I’m not going to have MY nose rubbed in the sand. I’m a mean, hard woman,’ she explained to Rosemary, and then raising her voice, ‘Children, put on your bathing suits!’
“我们适应得很好，”她笑着坚持说。 “我不会让自己的鼻子在沙子里摩擦。”我是个刻薄、严厉的女人，”她向罗斯玛丽解释道，然后提高了声音，“孩子们，穿上泳衣！”

Rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical one of her life, the one that would always pop up in her memory at the mention of swimming. Simultaneously the whole party moved toward the water, super-ready from the long, forced inaction, passing from the heat to the cool with the gourmandise of a tingling curry eaten with chilled white wine. The Divers’ day was spaced like the day of the older civilizations to yield the utmost from the materials at hand, and to give all the transitions their full value, and she did not know that there would be another transition presently from the utter absorption of the swim to the garrulity of the Provençal lunch hour. But again she had the sense that Dick was taking care of her, and she delighted in responding to the eventual movement as if it had been an order.
罗斯玛丽觉得这次游泳将成为她一生中最典型的一次，每次一提到游泳就会浮现在她的记忆中。与此同时，整个队伍向水边走去，从长时间被迫的无所事事中得到了超级准备，从炎热到凉爽，品尝着刺痛的咖喱和冰镇白葡萄酒的美食。戴弗斯的日子就像古老文明的日子一样间隔开，以便从手头的材料中获得最大的成果，并赋予所有转变其全部价值，她不知道在完全吸收畅游普罗旺斯午餐时间的喧嚣。但她再次感觉到迪克在照顾她，她很高兴对最终的动作做出反应，就好像这是一个命令一样。

Nicole handed her husband the curious garment on which she had been working. He went into the dressing tent and inspired a commotion by appearing in a moment clad in transparent black lace drawers. Close inspection revealed that actually they were lined with fleshcolored cloth.
妮可把她一直在制作的那件奇怪的衣服递给她的丈夫。他走进更衣帐篷，穿着透明的黑色蕾丝抽屉出现，瞬间引起了骚动。仔细一看，原来里面是肉色的布。

‘Well, if that isn’t a pansys trick!’ exclaimed Mr. McKisco contemptuously—then turning quickly to Mr. Dumphry and Mr. Campion, he added, ‘Oh, I beg your pardon.’
“好吧，如果这不是三色堇把戏的话！”麦基斯科先生轻蔑地喊道，然后迅速转向邓弗里先生和坎皮恩先生，他补充道，“哦，请原谅。”

Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her naïveté responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather than quantity from the run of the world’s bazaar; and that the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained through struggles she could not have guessed at. At that moment the Divers represented externally the exact furthermost evolution of a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside them—in reality a qualitative change had already set in that was not at all apparent to Rosemary.
迷迭香看着树干，高兴得直冒泡。她的天真全心全意地回应了 Divers 昂贵的简约，没有意识到它的复杂性和缺乏纯真，没有意识到这都是从世界集市上挑选出来的质量而不是数量；行为的简单性、托儿所般的平静和善意、对简单美德的强调，都是与众神的绝望交易的一部分，是通过她无法猜测的斗争获得的。在那一刻，戴弗族在外表上代表了一个阶级的最进一步的进化，因此大多数人在他们身边都显得很尴尬——事实上，质的变化已经发生，而罗斯玛丽根本看不到这一点。

She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers. Dick Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strong mouth said thoughtfully and deliberately:
当他们喝雪利酒、吃饼干时，她和他们站在一起。迪克·戴弗用冰冷的蓝眼睛看着她。他那慈祥、有力的嘴若有所思、从容地说：

‘You’re the only girl I’ve seen for a long time that actually did look like something blooming.’
“你是我这么长时间以来见过的唯一一个看起来确实像盛开的女孩。”

In her mother’s lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried.
随后，罗斯玛丽在母亲的腿上哭个不停。

‘I love him, Mother. I’m desperately in love with him—I never knew I could feel that way about anybody. And he’s married and I like her too—it’s just hopeless. Oh, I love him so!’
“我爱他，妈妈。我非常爱他——我从来不知道我会对任何人有这样的感觉。他已经结婚了，我也喜欢她——这只是无望的。哦，我太爱他了！

‘I’m curious to meet him.’
“我很想见见他。”

‘She invited us to dinner Friday.’
“她周五邀请我们共进晚餐。”

‘If you’re in love it ought to make you happy. You ought to laugh.’
‘如果你恋爱了，它应该让你快乐。你应该笑。

Rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of her face and laughed. Her mother always had a great influence on her.
罗斯玛丽抬起头来，脸上微微颤抖着，笑了起来。她的母亲一直对她影响很大。

V

Rosemary went to Monte Carlo nearly as sulkily as it was possible for her to be. She rode up the rugged hill to La Turbie, to an old Gaumont lot in process of reconstruction, and as she stood by the grilled entrance waiting for an answer to the message on her card, she might have been looking into Hollywood. The bizarre débris of some recent picture, a decayed street scene in India, a great cardboard whale, a monstrous tree bearing cherries large as basketballs, bloomed there by exotic dispensation, autochthonous as the pale amaranth, mimosa, cork oak or dwarfed pine. There were a quick-lunch shack and two barnlike stages and everywhere about the lot, groups of waiting, hopeful, painted faces.
罗斯玛丽尽可能地闷闷不乐地去了蒙特卡洛。她骑着马爬上崎岖的山坡，来到拉图尔比，来到一处正在重建的高蒙旧地段，当她站在铁栅门旁等待卡上信息的答复时，她可能一直在寻找好莱坞。最近的一些照片中的奇异碎片，印度腐烂的街景，一头巨大的纸板鲸鱼，一棵结有篮球那么大的樱桃的巨树，在异国情调中绽放，像苍白苋菜，含羞草，栓皮栎或矮松一样本土。那里有一个快餐小屋和两个谷仓一样的舞台，场地周围到处都是一群群等待着、满怀希望、涂着彩绘的脸。

After ten minutes a young man with hair the color of canary feathers hurried down to the gate.
十分钟后，一个头发金丝雀羽毛颜色的年轻人匆匆来到门口。

‘Come in, Miss Hoyt. Mr. Brady’s on the set, but he’s very anxious to see you. I’m sorry you were kept waiting, but you know some of these French dames are worse about pushing themselves in—‘
“请进，霍伊特小姐。布雷迪先生在片场，但他非常渴望见到你。我很抱歉让你久等了，但你知道有些法国贵妇更不喜欢强迫自己——”

The studio manager opened a small door in the blank wall of stage building and with sudden glad familiarity Rosemary followed him into half darkness. Here and there figures spotted the twilight, turning up ashen faces to her like souls in purgatory watching the passage of a mortal through. There were whispers and soft voices and, apparently from afar, the gentle tremolo of a small organ. Turning the corner made by some flats, they came upon the white crackling glow of a stage, where a French actor—his shirt front, collar, and cuffs tinted a brilliant pink—and an American actress stood motionless face to face. They stared at each other with dogged eyes, as though they had been in the same position for hours; and still for a long time nothing happened, no one moved. A bank of lights went off with a savage hiss, went on again; the plaintive tap of a hammer begged admission to nowhere in the distance; a blue face appeared among the blinding lights above, called something unintelligible into the upper blackness. Then the silence was broken by a voice in front of Rosemary.
工作室经理在舞台建筑的空白墙上打开了一扇小门，罗斯玛丽突然很高兴地跟着他进入半黑暗的地方。时不时有人看见暮色，向她露出苍白的脸，就像炼狱中的灵魂注视着凡人的经过。耳语声、轻柔的声音，还有小风琴轻柔的颤音，显然是从远处传来的。转过一些公寓形成的拐角，他们来到了一个白色的、噼啪作响的舞台上，一位法国演员——他的衬衫前襟、衣领和袖口都染上了亮粉色——和一位美国女演员面对面站着一动不动。他们死死地盯着对方，仿佛几个小时以来一直保持同一个姿势。但很长一段时间，什么也没发生，没有人动。一排灯发出野蛮的嘶嘶声，熄灭了，又亮了。锤子哀怨的敲击声恳求着远处无处可去。一张蓝色的脸出现在头顶眩目的灯光中，在上方的黑暗中召唤着某种难以理解的东西。然后罗斯玛丽面前的一个声音打破了沉默。

‘Baby, you don’t take off the stockings, you can spoil ten more pairs. That dress is fifteen pounds.’
‘宝贝，你再不脱掉袜子，你又会弄坏十双。那件衣服重十五磅。”

Stepping backward the speaker ran against Rosemary, whereupon the studio manager said, ‘Hey, Earl—Miss Hoyt.’
演讲者向后退了一步，撞到了罗斯玛丽，工作室经理说道：“嘿，厄尔——霍伊特小姐。”

They were meeting for the first time. Brady was quick and strenuous. As he took her hand she saw him look her over from head to foot, a gesture she recognized and that made her feel at home, but gave her always a faint feeling of superiority to whoever made it. If her person was property she could exercise whatever advantage was inherent in its ownership.
他们是第一次见面。布雷迪速度很快，而且很吃力。当他握住她的手时，她看到他从头到脚地打量着她，她认出了这个姿势，这让她有宾至如归的感觉，但总是给她一种隐隐约约的优越感，无论是谁做出来的。如果她的人身是财产，她就可以行使所有权所固有的任何优势。

‘I thought you’d be along any day now,’ Brady said, in a voice that was just a little too compelling for private life, and that trailed with it a faintly defiant cockney accent. ‘Have a good trip?’
“我以为你现在随时都会来，”布雷迪说，他的声音对于私人生活来说有点太引人注目了，而且还带着一丝挑衅的伦敦口音。 '旅行愉快？'

‘Yes, but we’re glad to be going home.’
“是的，但我们很高兴能回家。”

‘No-o-o!’ he protested. ‘Stay awhile—I want to talk to you. Let me tell you that was some picture of yours—that ‘Daddy’s Girl.’ I saw it in Paris. I wired the coast right away to see if you were signed.’
“不——哦——哦！”他抗议道。 “等一下——我想和你谈谈。”让我告诉你，那是你的一些照片——那张“爸爸的女孩”。我在巴黎看到它。我立即给海岸打了电报，看看你是否已签约。

‘I just had—I’m sorry.’
“我刚刚——对不起。”

‘God, what a picture!’
“天啊，多美的画面啊！”

Not wanting to smile in silly agreement Rosemary frowned.
罗斯玛丽不想傻笑地同意，她皱起了眉头。

‘Nobody wants to be thought of forever for just one picture,’ she said.
“没有人愿意仅仅因为一张照片而被永远铭记，”她说。

‘Sure—that’s right. What’re your plans?’
‘当然——没错。你有什么计划？

‘Mother thought I needed a rest. When I get back we’ll probably either sign up with First National or keep on with Famous.’
“妈妈认为我需要休息。当我回来时，我们可能要么与 First National 签约，要么继续与 Famous 签约。

‘Who’s we?’
“我们是谁？”

‘My mother. She decides business matters. I couldn’t do without her.’
'我的母亲。商业事务由她决定。我不能没有她。

Again he looked her over completely, and, as he did, something in Rosemary went out to him. It was not liking, not at all the spontaneous admiration she had felt for the man on the beach this morning. It was a click. He desired her and, so far as her virginal emotions went, she contemplated a surrender with equanimity. Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after she left him—like an actor kissed in a picture.
他再次彻底审视了她，当他这样做时，罗斯玛丽身上的某种东西向他显现出来。这不是她喜欢的，完全不是她今天早上对海滩上那个男人自发的钦佩。一声点击。他渴望她，而就她纯洁的情感而言，她平静地考虑着投降。然而她知道，在离开他半小时后，她就会忘记他——就像电影中亲吻的演员一样。

‘Where are you staying?’ Brady asked. ‘Oh, yes, at Gausse’s. Well, my plans are made for this year, too, but that letter I wrote you still stands. Rather make a picture with you than any girl since Connie Talmadge was a kid.’
“你住在哪里？”布雷迪问。 “哦，是的，在高斯家。嗯，我今年的计划也已经制定好了，但是我写给你的那封信仍然有效。自从康妮·塔尔梅奇小时候以来，我宁愿和你合影，也不愿和任何女孩合影。”

‘I feel the same way. Why don’t you come back to Hollywood?’
'我有同样的感觉。你为什么不回到好莱坞？

‘I can’t stand the damn place. I’m fine here. Wait till after this shot and I’ll show you around.’
“我受不了这个该死的地方。我在这里很好。等拍完这张照片，我带你四处看看。

Walking onto the set he began to talk to the French actor in a low, quiet voice.
走进片场，他开始用低沉、安静的声音与这位法国演员交谈。

Five minutes passed—Brady talked on, while from time to time the Frenchman shifted his feet and nodded. Abruptly, Brady broke off, calling something to the lights that startled them into a humming glare. Los Angeles was loud about Rosemary now. Unappalled she moved once more through the city of thin partitions, wanting to be back there. But she did not want to see Brady in the mood she sensed he would be in after he had finished and she left the lot with a spell still upon her. The Mediterranean world was less silent now that she knew the studio was there. She liked the people on the streets and bought herself a pair of espadrilles on the way to the train.
五分钟过去了，布雷迪继续讲话，法国人时不时地移动脚步并点点头。突然，布雷迪停了下来，对着灯光喊了些什么，这让他们发出嗡嗡的眩光。洛杉矶现在对迷迭香的关注度很高。她毫不震惊地再次穿过这座薄弱的城墙，想要回到那里。但她不想看到布雷迪处于那种心情，她预感到他完成后会处于这样的状态，而她带着咒语离开了停车场。既然她知道工作室就在那里，地中海世界就不那么安静了。她喜欢街上的人，在去火车的路上给自己买了一双麻底鞋。

Her mother was pleased that she had done so accurately what she was told to do, but she still wanted to launch her out and away. Mrs. Speers was fresh in appearance but she was tired; death beds make people tired indeed and she had watched beside a couple.
她的母亲很高兴她能如此准确地按照要求做，但她仍然想把她推出去。斯皮尔斯夫人看上去精神焕发，但她很疲倦。死亡之床确实让人很累，她曾在一对夫妇旁边看过。

VI

Feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, Nicole Diver folded her arms high enough for the artificial camellia on her shoulder to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely grassless garden. The garden was bounded on one side by the house, from which it flowed and into which it ran, on two sides by the old village, and on the last by the cliff falling by ledges to the sea.
午餐时喝了玫瑰色的葡萄酒，妮可·戴弗感觉很好，她把双臂交叉得足够高，让肩上的人造山茶花接触到她的脸颊，然后走进她可爱的、没有草的花园。花园的一侧以房屋为界，花园从那里流出，又流入那里，两侧以古老的村庄为界，最后一侧以悬崖为界，悬崖上的壁架伸向大海。

Along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the wriggling vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual wheel-barrow, left only a moment since, but already grown into the path, atrophied and faintly rotten. Nicole was invariably somewhat surprised that by turning in the other direction past a bed of peonies she walked into an area so green and cool that the leaves and petals were curled with tender damp.
沿着村边的墙壁，一切都尘土飞扬，蠕动的藤蔓，柠檬树和桉树，随意的独轮车，刚离开不久，但已经长进了小路，萎缩了，略显腐烂。妮可总是有些惊讶，当她转向另一个方向经过一片牡丹花床时，她走进了一个如此绿色和凉爽的区域，叶子和花瓣因温柔的潮湿而卷曲。

Knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in the achromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and down around her moving feet in a lilac shadow. Her face was hard, almost stern, save for the soft gleam of piteous doubt that looked from her green eyes. Her once fair hair had darkened, but she was lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been at eighteen, when her hair was brighter than she.
她脖子上系着一条淡紫色的围巾，即使在无色的阳光下，这条围巾的颜色也会投射到她的脸上，并在她移动的脚周围投射出淡紫色的阴影。她的脸很冷酷，几乎是严厉的，除了她绿色的眼睛里闪烁着可怜的怀疑的柔和光芒。她曾经的金发已经变黑了，但现在二十四岁的她比十八岁时更可爱，当时她的头发比她更亮。

Following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom that followed the white border stones she came to a space overlooking the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the fig trees and a big table and wicker chairs and a great market umbrella from Sienna, all gathered about an enormous pine, the biggest tree in the garden. She paused there a moment, looking absently at a growth of nasturtiums and iris tangled at its foot, as though sprung from a careless handful of seeds, listening to the plaints and accusations of some nursery squabble in the house. When this died away on the summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies massed in pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile mauve-stemmed roses, transparent like sugar flowers in a confectioner’s window— until, as if the scherzo of color could reach no further intensity, it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and moist steps went down to a level five feet below.
沿着白色的边界石，沿着一条无形的花朵雾气行走，她来到了一个俯瞰大海的空间，那里的无花果树上睡着了灯笼，还有一张大桌子、藤椅和一把来自锡耶纳的巨大市场雨伞，所有这些都聚集在一起关于一棵巨​​大的松树，花园里最大的树。她在那儿停了一会儿，心不在焉地看着一丛丛金莲花和鸢尾花，纠缠在它的脚下，仿佛是从一把不小心的一把种子中长出来的，听着房子里关于苗圃争吵的抱怨和指责。当这一切在夏日的空气中消失后，她继续前行，在粉色云朵簇拥的万花筒牡丹、黑色和棕色的郁金香以及脆弱的紫红色茎玫瑰之间行走，玫瑰像糖果店橱窗里的糖花一样透明——直到，仿佛色彩的谐谑曲可以没有达到进一步的强度，它在半空中突然中断，潮湿的脚步下降到五英尺以下的高度。

Here there was a well with the boarding around it dank and slippery even on the brightest days. She went up the stairs on the other side and into the vegetable garden; she walked rather quickly; she liked to be active, though at times she gave an impression of repose that was at once static and evocative. This was because she knew few words and believed in none, and in the world she was rather silent, contributing just her share of urbane humor with a precision that approached meagreness. But at the moment when strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the presence of this economy she would seize the topic and rush off with it, feverishly surprised with herself—then bring it back and relinquish it abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient retriever, having been adequate and something more.
这里有一口井，周围的木板即使在最晴朗的日子里也又湿又滑。她爬上另一边的楼梯，走进菜园。她走得很快；她喜欢活跃，尽管有时她给人一种安静的印象，既静态又令人回味。这是因为她认识的词很少，也不相信任何词，而且在这个世界上她相当沉默，只以一种近乎微薄的精确度贡献着她那份温文尔雅的幽默。但当陌生人在这种经济面前感到不自在时，她就会抓住这个话题，匆匆离开，对自己感到非常惊讶——然后把它带回来，然后突然放弃它，几乎是胆怯的，就像一只听话的猎犬，已经足够了，还有更多。

As she stood in the fuzzy green light of the vegetable garden, Dick crossed the path ahead of her going to his work house. Nicole waited silently till he had passed; then she went on through lines of prospective salads to a little menagerie where pigeons and rabbits and a parrot made a medley of insolent noises at her. Descending to another ledge she reached a low, curved wall and looked down seven hundred feet to the Mediterranean Sea.
当她站在菜园模糊的绿光中时，迪克穿过她前面的小路，去他的工作室。妮可静静地等着他走过去。然后她继续穿过一排排的沙拉，来到一个小动物园，那里有鸽子、兔子和一只鹦鹉对她发出杂乱无礼的叫声。她下降到另一个岩架，到达一堵低矮的弧形墙壁，俯瞰七百英尺处的地中海。

She stood in the ancient hill village of Tarmes. The villa and its grounds were made out of a row of peasant dwellings that abutted on the cliff—five small houses had been combined to make the house and four destroyed to make the garden. The exterior walls were untouched so that from the road far below it was indistinguishable from the violet gray mass of the town.
她站在塔尔梅斯古老的山村里。别墅及其场地是由一排紧靠悬崖的农舍建造而成的——五栋小房子被组合成房子，四栋被毁坏了成为花园。外墙没有受到任何影响，因此从远处的道路上看，它与城镇的紫灰色物体无法区分。

For a moment Nicole stood looking down at the Mediterranean but there was nothing to do with that, even with her tireless hands. Presently Dick came out of his one-room house carrying a telescope and looked east toward Cannes. In a moment Nicole swam into his field of vision, whereupon he disappeared into his house and came out with a megaphone. He had many light mechanical devices.
妮可站在那里，俯视着地中海，但即使她用不知疲倦的双手，也无济于事。不久，迪克带着一架望远镜从他只有一间房间的房子里出来，向东望向戛纳。一会儿，妮可就游进了他的视野，随后他就消失在自己的房子里，拿着扩音器走了出来。他拥有许多轻型机械装置。

‘Nicole,’ he shouted, ‘I forgot to tell you that as a final apostolic gesture I invited Mrs. Abrams, the woman with the white hair.’
“妮可，”他喊道，“我忘了告诉你，作为最后的使徒姿态，我邀请了艾布拉姆斯夫人，那个白发女人。”

‘I suspected it. It’s an outrage.’
” “我怀疑过。这是一种愤怒。

The ease with which her reply reached him seemed to belittle his megaphone, so she raised her voice and called, ‘Can you hear me?’
她的回答轻而易举地传到了他的耳朵里，似乎贬低了他的扩音器，所以她提高了声音喊道：“你能听到我说话吗？”

‘Yes.’ He lowered the megaphone and then raised it stubbornly. ‘I’m going to invite some more people too. I’m going to invite the two young men.’
“是的。”他放下扩音器，又固执地举起。 ‘我还要邀请更多的人。我要邀请那两个年轻人。”

‘All right,’ she agreed placidly.
“好吧，”她平静地同意。

‘I want to give a really BAD party. I mean it. I want to give a party where there’s a brawl and seductions and people going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de toilette. You wait and see.’
“我想举办一场非常糟糕的派对。我是认真的。我想要举办一个派对，其中有争吵和诱惑，人们带着感情受伤回家，女人在厕所柜子里昏倒。你等着瞧吧。

He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed. This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.
他回到自己的房子里，妮可发现他身上有一种最典型的情绪，兴奋让每个人都陷入其中，随后不可避免地出现了他自己的忧郁，他从未表现出来，但她猜到了。这种对事物的兴奋达到了与其重要性不成比例的程度，产生了与人交往的真正非凡的技巧。除了少数顽固且常年多疑的人之外，他有能力唤起一种令人着迷的、不加批判的爱。当他意识到其中所涉及的浪费和奢侈时，他做出了反应。有时，他会怀着敬畏的心情回顾自己所给予的爱的狂欢，就像一位将军凝视着他为了满足非个人的嗜血欲望而下令进行的屠杀一样。

But to be included in Dick Diver’s world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its allinclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.
但进入迪克·戴弗的世界一段时间是一次非凡的经历：人们相信他对他们有特别的保留，认识到他们的命运令人自豪的独特性，被埋藏在多少年的妥协之下。他以精妙的考虑和礼貌迅速赢得了所有人的青睐，这种礼貌和行动如此迅速和直观，以至于只能从其效果来检验。然后，他毫不谨慎地打开了通往他有趣世界的大门，以免这段关系的最初花朵枯萎。只要他们完全同意，他们的幸福就是他的全神贯注，但一旦对其包容性产生怀疑，他就在他们眼前消失了，对他说过的话或做过的事几乎没有留下任何可交流的记忆。

At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his first guests, his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather promisingly, in his hand, like a toreador’s cape. It was characteristic that after greeting Rosemary and her mother he waited for them to speak first, as if to allow them the reassurance of their own voices in new surroundings.
那天晚上八点三十分，他出来迎接第一批客人，他的外套相当隆重，相当有希望地拿在手里，就像斗牛士的斗篷。典型的做法是，在与罗斯玛丽和她母亲打招呼后，他等她们先开口，仿佛是为了让她们在新的环境中对自己的声音感到安心。

To resume Rosemary’s point of view it should be said that, under the spell of the climb to Tarmes and the fresher air, she and her mother looked about appreciatively. Just as the personal qualities of extraordinary people can make themselves plain in an unaccustomed change of expression, so the intensely calculated perfection of Villa Diana transpired all at once through such minute failures as the chance apparition of a maid in the background or the perversity of a cork. While the first guests arrived bringing with them the excitement of the night, the domestic activity of the day receded past them gently, symbolized by the Diver children and their governess still at supper on the terrace.
为了恢复罗斯玛丽的观点，应该说，在攀登塔尔姆斯和新鲜空气的魅力下，她和她的母亲赞赏地环顾四周。正如杰出人物的个人品质可以通过不习惯的表达方式的变化来暴露自己一样，戴安娜别墅的精心设计的完美也通过诸如背景中女仆的偶然出现或一个反常的反常的微小失误而突然显现出来。软木。当第一批客人到来时，他们带来了夜晚的兴奋，但白天的家庭活动却在他们身边轻轻地退去，以戴弗家的孩子们和他们的家庭女教师仍在露台上吃晚饭为标志。

‘What a beautiful garden!’ Mrs. Speers exclaimed.
“多么美丽的花园啊！”斯皮尔斯夫人惊叹道。

‘Nicole’s garden,’ said Dick. ‘She won’t let it alone—she nags it all the time, worries about its diseases. Any day now I expect to have her come down with Powdery Mildew or Fly Speck, or Late Blight.’ He pointed his forefinger decisively at Rosemary, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal interest, ‘I’m going to save your reason—I’m going to give you a hat to wear on the beach.’
“妮可的花园，”迪克说。 “她不会放过它——她总是对它唠叨，担心它的疾病。现在我随时都希望她患上白粉病、蝇斑病或晚疫病。”他用食指果断地指着罗斯玛丽，语气轻松地说，似乎隐藏着父亲的兴趣，“我要拯救你的理智。” ——我会给你一顶帽子，让你在海滩上戴。”

He turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he poured a cocktail. Earl Brady arrived, discovering Rosemary with surprise. His manner was softer than at the studio, as if his differentness had been put on at the gate, and Rosemary, comparing him instantly with Dick Diver, swung sharply toward the latter. In comparison Earl Brady seemed faintly gross, faintly ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric response to his person.
他把他们从花园转到露台，在那里倒了一杯鸡尾酒。厄尔·布雷迪赶到了，惊讶地发现了罗斯玛丽。他的态度比在工作室里要温和，仿佛他的与众不同是在门口就表现出来的，罗斯玛丽立即将他与迪克·戴弗进行比较，猛地转向后者。相比之下，厄尔·布雷迪显得有些粗俗，有些没教养。然而，她再一次感受到了他身上的触电反应。

He spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up from their outdoor supper.
他对刚从户外吃完晚饭起床的孩子们说话，语气很亲切。

‘Hello, Lanier, how about a song? Will you and Topsy sing me a song?’
“你好，拉尼尔，来首歌怎么样？你和托普西能给我唱首歌吗？

‘What shall we sing?’ agreed the little boy, with the odd chanting accent of American children brought up in France.
“我们唱什么？”小男孩同意道，他的口音带有在法国长大的美国孩子的奇怪口音。

‘That song about ‘Mon Ami Pierrot.’’
“那首歌是关于《我的阿米·皮埃罗》的。”

Brother and sister stood side by side without self-consciousness and their voices soared sweet and shrill upon the evening air.
兄妹俩毫不自觉地并肩站着，他们的声音在傍晚的空气中甜美而尖锐。

“Au clair de la lune
“月光之光

Mon Ami Pierrot
我的阿米·皮埃罗

Prête-moi ta plume
我的羽毛

Pour écrire un mot
写下一句话

Ma chandelle est morte
我死了

Je n’ai plus de feu
Ouvre-moi ta porte
我们的门

Pour l’amour de Dieu.’
献给上帝之爱。”

The singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow with the late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success. Rosemary was thinking that the Villa Diana was the centre of the world. On such a stage some memorable thing was sure to happen. She lighted up higher as the gate tinkled open and the rest of the guests arrived in a body—the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Mr. Campion came up to the terrace.
歌声停止了，孩子们的脸被迟来的阳光照得通红，站在那里，为他们的成功而平静地微笑。罗斯玛丽认为戴安娜别墅是世界的中心。在这样的舞台上，肯定会发生一些令人难忘的事情。当大门叮叮当当打开时，她的亮度更高了，其余的客人也陆续抵达——麦基斯科夫妇、艾布拉姆斯夫人、邓弗里先生和坎皮恩先生来到了露台。

Rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment—she looked quickly at Dick, as though to ask an explanation of this incongruous mingling. But there was nothing unusual in his expression. He greeted his new guests with a proud bearing and an obvious deference to their infinite and unknown possibilities. She believed in him so much that presently she accepted the rightness of the McKiscos’ presence as if she had expected to meet them all along.
罗斯玛丽有一种强烈的失望感——她飞快地看了迪克一眼，似乎是在要求他对这种不协调的混合做出解释。但他的表情并没有什么异常。他以自豪的态度迎接新客人，并明显尊重他们无限和未知的可能性。她非常相信他，以至于很快她就接受了麦基斯科夫妇出现的正确性，就好像她一直期待着见到他们一样。

‘I’ve met you in Paris,’ McKisco said to Abe North, who with his wife had arrived on their heels, ‘in fact I’ve met you twice.’
“我在巴黎见过你，”麦基斯科对阿贝·诺斯说，“事实上，我已经见过你两次了。”阿贝·诺斯和他的妻子紧随其后抵达。

‘Yes, I remember,’ Abe said.
“是的，我记得，”阿贝说。

‘Then where was it?’ demanded McKisco, not content to let well enough alone.
“那它在哪儿？”麦基斯科问道，他不甘心就此罢休。

‘Why, I think—‘ Abe got tired of the game, ‘I can’t remember.’
“为什么，我想——”亚伯厌倦了这个游戏，“我不记得了。”

The interchange filled a pause and Rosemary’s instinct was that something tactful should be said by somebody, but Dick made no attempt to break up the grouping formed by these late arrivals, not even to disarm Mrs. McKisco of her air of supercilious amusement. He did not solve this social problem because he knew it was not of importance at the moment and would solve itself. He was saving his newness for a larger effort, waiting a more significant moment for his guests to be conscious of a good time.
双方的交流中出现了一阵停顿，罗斯玛丽的本能是有人应该说点委婉的话，但迪克并没有试图打破这些迟到的人组成的群体，甚至没有消除麦基斯科夫人傲慢的娱乐神态。他没有解决这个社会问题，因为他知道这目前并不重要，并且会自行解决。他正在把自己的新鲜感留到更大的努力上，等待一个更重要的时刻，让他的客人意识到美好的时光。

Rosemary stood beside Tommy Barban—he was in a particularly scornful mood and there seemed to be some special stimulus working upon him. He was leaving in the morning.
罗斯玛丽站在汤米·巴班身边——他的心情特别轻蔑，似乎受到了某种特殊的刺激。他早上就要离开。

‘Going home?’
'回家？'

‘Home? I have no home. I am going to a war.’
'家？我没有家。我要去打仗了。

‘What war?’
“什么战争？”

‘What war? Any war. I haven’t seen a paper lately but I suppose there’s a war—there always is.’
‘什么战争？任何战争。我最近没看到报纸，但我想有一场战争——一直都有。”

‘Don’t you care what you fight for?’
“你不在乎你为什么而战吗？”

‘Not at all—so long as I’m well treated. When I’m in a rut I come to see the Divers, because then I know that in a few weeks I’ll want to go to war.’
“一点也不——只要我受到良好的对待。当我陷入困境时，我会去看戴弗斯队，因为那时我知道几周后我就会想去打仗。

Rosemary stiffened.
罗斯玛丽浑身僵硬。

‘You like the Divers,’ she reminded him.
“你喜欢潜水员，”她提醒他。

‘Of course—especially her—but they make me want to go to war.’
“当然——尤其是她——但它们让我想要参战。”

She considered this, to no avail. The Divers made her want to stay near them forever.
她想了想，却无济于事。潜水员让她想永远留在他们身边。

‘You’re half American,’ she said, as if that should solve the problem.
“你有一半美国人血统，”她说道，仿佛这样就可以解决问题了。

‘Also I’m half French, and I was educated in England and since I was eighteen I’ve worn the uniforms of eight countries. But I hope I did not give you the impression that I am not fond of the Divers— I am, especially of Nicole.’
“而且我有一半法国血统，我在英国接受教育，从十八岁起我就穿过八个国家的制服。但我希望我没有给你留下我不喜欢戴弗夫妇的印象——我喜欢，尤其是妮可。

‘How could any one help it?’ she said simply.
“谁能帮得上忙呢？”她简单地说。

She felt far from him. The undertone of his words repelled her and she withdrew her adoration for the Divers from the profanity of his bitterness. She was glad he was not next to her at dinner and she was still thinking of his words ‘especially her’ as they moved toward the table in the garden.
她感觉自己离他很远。他话语中的低调使她感到厌恶，她从他的尖酸刻薄的脏话中收回了对戴弗夫妇的崇拜。她很高兴晚餐时他不在她旁边，当他们走向花园里的桌子时，她仍在想着他的话“尤其是她”。

For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path. Alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded into the surety that he knew everything. For a year, which was forever, she had had money and a certain celebrity and contact with the celebrated, and these latter had presented themselves merely as powerful enlargements of the people with whom the doctor’s widow and her daughter had associated in a hôtel-pension in Paris. Rosemary was a romantic and her career had not provided many satisfactory opportunities on that score. Her mother, with the idea of a career for Rosemary, would not tolerate any such spurious substitutes as the excitations available on all sides, and indeed Rosemary was already beyond that—she was In the movies but not at all At them. So when she had seen approval of Dick Diver in her mother’s face it meant that he was ‘the real thing”; it meant permission to go as far as she could.
有那么一会儿，她就站在小路上的迪克·戴弗身边。伴随着他那坚定而整洁的光芒，一切都消失了，他确信他知道一切。在这一年里，也就是永远的一年里，她有钱，有一定的名人，也有与名人的接触，而这些名人仅仅把自己表现为那些与医生的遗孀和她的女儿在旅馆旅馆里交往过的人的强大扩张。在巴黎。罗斯玛丽是一个浪漫的人，在这一点上她的职业生涯并没有提供很多令人满意的机会。她的母亲考虑到罗斯玛丽的职业生涯，不会容忍任何像各方都能获得的兴奋这样虚假的替代品，事实上，罗斯玛丽已经超越了这一点——她在电影中，但根本不在电影中。因此，当她看到母亲脸上对迪克·戴弗的认可时，就意味着他是“货真价实”的人。这意味着允许她走得尽可能远。

‘I was watching you,’ he said, and she knew he meant it. ‘We’ve grown very fond of you.’
“我在看着你，”他说，她知道他是认真的。 “我们已经非常喜欢你了。”

‘I fell in love with you the first time I saw you,’ she said quietly. He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment were purely formal.
“我第一次见到你的时候就爱上了你。”她轻声说道。他假装没听见，仿佛这番恭维只是纯粹的形式。

‘New friends,’ he said, as if it were an important point, ‘can often have a better time together than old friends.’
“新朋友，”他说道，仿佛这是一个重要的观点，“往往比老朋友在一起能度过更好的时光。”

With that remark, which she did not understand precisely, she found herself at the table, picked out by slowly emerging lights against the dark dusk. A chord of delight struck inside her when she saw that Dick had taken her mother on his right hand; for herself she was between Luis Campion and Brady.
说着这句话，她听不懂，然后她发现自己坐在桌边，在黑暗的暮色中，慢慢亮起的灯光将她辨认出来。当她看到迪克把她的母亲握在右手上时，她心中升起了一股喜悦的心弦。就她自己而言，她处于路易斯·坎皮恩和布雷迪之间。

Surcharged with her emotion she turned to Brady with the intention of confiding in him, but at her first mention of Dick a hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand that he refused the fatherly office. In turn she was equally firm when he tried to monopolize her hand, so they talked shop or rather she listened while he talked shop, her polite eyes never leaving his face, but her mind was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he must guess the fact. Intermittently she caught the gist of his sentences and supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one picks up the striking of a clock in the middle with only the rhythm of the first uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.
她情绪激动地转向布雷迪，打算向他吐露心声，但当她第一次提到迪克时，他眼中闪烁着冷酷的光芒，让她明白他拒绝担任父亲的职务。反过来，当他试图垄断她的手时，她也同样坚定，所以他们谈论正事，或者更确切地说，当他谈论正事时，她听着，她礼貌的目光从未离开过他的脸，但她的思绪如此明确，以至于她觉得他一定猜到了事实。她断断续续地捕捉到了他句子的要点，并从潜意识中补充了其余的内容，就像一个人听到了中间的钟声，脑海中只剩下无数敲击声的节奏。

七

In a pause Rosemary looked away and up the table where Nicole sat between Tommy Barban and Abe North, her chow’s hair foaming and frothing in the candlelight. Rosemary listened, caught sharply by the rich clipped voice in infrequent speech:
罗斯玛丽停顿了一下，把目光移开，抬头望向桌子，妮可坐在汤米·巴班和阿贝·诺斯之间，她的头发在烛光下冒着泡沫。罗斯玛丽听着，被不常见的讲话中丰富而削促的声音所吸引：

‘The poor man,’ Nicole exclaimed. ‘Why did you want to saw him in two?’
“这个可怜的人，”妮可喊道。 “你为什么想把他分成两半？”

‘Naturally I wanted to see what was inside a waiter. Wouldn’t you like to know what was inside a waiter?’
“我当然想看看服务员里面有什么。你不想知道服务员里面有什么吗？

‘Old menus,’ suggested Nicole with a short laugh. ‘Pieces of broken china and tips and pencil stubs.’
“旧菜单。”妮可笑道。 “破碎的瓷器碎片、笔尖和铅笔头。”

‘Exactly—but the thing was to prove it scientifically. And of course doing it with that musical saw would have eliminated any sordidness.’
“没错——但问题是要用科学的方式证明这一点。当然，用那把音乐锯来做就可以消除任何肮脏的东西。

‘Did you intend to play the saw while you performed the operation?’ Tommy inquired.
“做手术的时候你打算玩锯子吗？”汤米问道。

‘We didn’t get quite that far. We were alarmed by the screams. We thought he might rupture something.’
“我们还没有走到那么远。我们被尖叫声吓坏了。我们认为他可能会弄碎一些东西。

‘All sounds very peculiar to me,’ said Nicole. ‘Any musician that’ll use another musician’s saw to—‘
“这一切对我来说听起来都很奇怪，”妮可说。 “任何使用其他音乐家的锯子的音乐家都可以——”

They had been at table half an hour and a perceptible change had set in—person by person had given up something, a preoccupation, an anxiety, a suspicion, and now they were only their best selves and the Divers’ guests. Not to have been friendly and interested would have seemed to reflect on the Divers, so now they were all trying, and seeing this, Rosemary liked everyone—except McKisco, who had contrived to be the unassimilated member of the party. This was less from ill will than from his determination to sustain with wine the good spirits he had enjoyed on his arrival. Lying back in his place between Earl Brady, to whom he had addressed several withering remarks about the movies, and Mrs. Abrams, to whom he said nothing, he stared at Dick Diver with an expression of devastating irony, the effect being occasionally interrupted by his attempts to engage Dick in a cater-cornered conversation across the table.
他们在餐桌上待了半个小时，明显的变化开始出现——每个人都放弃了一些东西，一种专注，一种焦虑，一种怀疑，现在他们只是最好的自己，是戴弗斯的客人。不友善和不感兴趣似乎会反映在潜水员身上，所以现在他们都在努力，看到这一点，罗斯玛丽喜欢每个人——除了麦基斯科，他故意成为党中不被同化的成员。这与其说是出于恶意，不如说是因为他决心用葡萄酒来维持他抵达时所享受的良好精神状态。他躺在厄尔·布雷迪和艾布拉姆斯夫人之间，他对布雷迪说了几句关于电影的尖酸刻薄的话，而艾布拉姆斯夫人什么也没说，他用一种毁灭性的讽刺表情盯着迪克·戴弗，这种效果偶尔会被他试图在桌子对面与迪克进行一场激烈的谈话。

‘Aren’t you a friend of Van Buren Denby?’ he would say.
“你不是范布伦·丹比的朋友吗？”他会说。

‘I don’t believe I know him.’
“我不相信我认识他。”

‘I thought you were a friend of his,’ he persisted irritably.
“我以为你是他的朋友，”他烦躁地坚持道。

When the subject of Mr. Denby fell of its own weight, he essayed other equally irrelative themes, but each time the very deference of Dick’s attention seemed to paralyze him, and after a moment’s stark pause the conversation that he had interrupted would go on without him. He tried breaking into other dialogues, but it was like continually shaking hands with a glove from which the hand had been withdrawn—so finally, with a resigned air of being among children, he devoted his attention entirely to the champagne.
当丹比先生的话题自然而然地落下时，他又开始尝试其他同样不相干的话题，但每次迪克的注意力似乎都让他陷入瘫痪，在片刻的彻底停顿之后，他打断的谈话就会继续下去，而无需担心。他。他试图打断其他对话，但这就像不断地戴着手套握手，但手却被抽走了——所以最后，他带着一种在孩子们中间的无奈神情，把注意力完全集中在香槟上。

Rosemary’s glance moved at intervals around the table, eager for the others’ enjoyment, as if they were her future stepchildren. A gracious table light, emanating from a bowl of spicy pinks, fell upon Mrs. Abrams’ face, cooked to a turn in Veuve Cliquot, full of vigor, tolerance, adolescent good will; next to her sat Mr. Royal Dumphry, his girl’s comeliness less startling in the pleasure world of evening. Then Violet McKisco, whose prettiness had been piped to the surface of her, so that she ceased her struggle to make tangible to herself her shadowy position as the wife of an arriviste who had not arrived.
罗斯玛丽的目光时不时地在桌子周围移动，渴望其他人的享受，就好像他们是她未来的继子一样。一碗辛辣的粉红色散发出亲切的台光，落在艾布拉姆斯夫人的脸上，她的脸在凯歌酒中煮熟，充满了活力、宽容和青春期的善意；她旁边坐着罗亚尔·邓弗里先生，他女儿的美丽在夜晚的欢乐世界中不那么令人吃惊。然后是维奥莱特·麦基斯科，她的美丽已经浮现到了她的表面，因此她不再努力让自己清楚地认识到自己作为一个尚未到来的暴发户妻子的隐秘地位。

Then came Dick, with his arms full of the slack he had taken up from others, deeply merged in his own party.
然后迪克来了，他的双臂充满了他从别人那里得到的闲暇，深深地融入了自己的政党。

Then her mother, forever perfect.
然后是她的母亲，永远完美。

Then Barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency that made Rosemary like him again. Then Nicole. Rosemary saw her suddenly in a new way and found her one of the most beautiful people she had ever known. Her face, the face of a saint, a viking Madonna, shone through the faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew down its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine. She was still as still.
然后巴尔班以温文尔雅、流利的语气与她母亲交谈，这让罗斯玛丽又喜欢上了他。然后是妮可.罗斯玛丽突然以一种新的方式看待她，发现她是她所认识的最美丽的人之一。她的脸，一张圣人的脸，一位维京圣母的脸，透过烛光上雪花般的微弱微粒闪闪发光，从松树上的酒色灯笼中汲取红晕。她还是一如既往的一动不动。

Abe North was talking to her about his moral code: ‘Of course I’ve got one,’ he insisted, ‘—a man can’t live without a moral code. Mine is that I’m against the burning of witches. Whenever they burn a witch I get all hot under the collar.’ Rosemary knew from Brady that he was a musician who after a brilliant and precocious start had composed nothing for seven years.
阿贝·诺斯正在和她谈论他的道德准则：“我当然有一个，”他坚持说，“一个人没有道德准则就无法生活。”我的观点是，我反对焚烧女巫。每当他们烧死一个女巫时，我都会感到浑身发烫。”罗斯玛丽从布雷迪那里得知，他是一位音乐家，在经历了辉煌而早熟的起步之后，已经有七年没有创作过任何东西了。

Next was Campion, managing somehow to restrain his most blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near him a certain disinterested motherliness. Then Mary North with a face so merry that it was impossible not to smile back into the white mirrors of her teeth—the whole area around her parted lips was a lovely little circle of delight.
接下来是坎皮恩，他设法抑制自己最明显的女性气质，甚至给身边的人一种无私的母性。然后是玛丽·诺斯，她的脸是如此快乐，以至于不可能不对着她洁白的牙齿微笑——她张开的嘴唇周围的整个区域都是一个可爱的小圆圈。

Finally Brady, whose heartiness became, moment by moment, a social thing instead of a crude assertion and reassertion of his own mental health, and his preservation of it by a detachment from the frailties of others.
最后是布雷迪，他的真诚逐渐成为一种社会事物，而不是对自己心理健康的粗暴断言和重申，以及通过脱离他人的弱点来保持这种健康。

Rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of Mrs. Burnett’s vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of a return from the derisive and salacious improvisations of the frontier. There were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dog baying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff. The table seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanical dancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of being alone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by its only food, warmed by its only lights. And, as if a curious hushed laugh from Mrs. McKisco were a signal that such a detachment from the world had been attained, the two Divers began suddenly to warm and glow and expand, as if to make up to their guests, already so subtly assured of their importance, so flattered with politeness, for anything they might still miss from that country well left behind. Just for a moment they seemed to speak to every one at the table, singly and together, assuring them of their friendliness, their affection. And for a moment the faces turned up toward them were like the faces of poor children at a Christmas tree. Then abruptly the table broke up—the moment when the guests had been daringly lifted above conviviality into the rarer atmosphere of sentiment, was over before it could be irreverently breathed, before they had half realized it was there.
迷迭香像一个从伯内特夫人的邪恶传单中走出来的孩子一样充满了信仰，她坚信要回家，要从边疆的嘲笑和淫荡的即兴创作中回归。黑暗的空气中飞舞着萤火虫，远处低矮的悬崖上有一只狗在狂吠。桌子似乎向天空升起一点，就像一个机械舞台，让周围的人有一种在黑暗的宇宙中彼此孤独的感觉，由唯一的食物滋养，由唯一的灯光温暖。麦基斯科夫人发出的一声好奇的、低声的笑声似乎是一种信号，表明他们已经达到了与世隔绝的境界，两位潜水员突然开始变得温暖、发光、膨胀，仿佛是为了补偿他们的客人，已经如此微妙了。他们确信自己的重要性，对他们可能仍然怀念的那个国家的任何东西都表现出礼貌，感到受宠若惊。就在那一瞬间，他们似乎在对餐桌上的每一个人说话，无论是单独的还是一起的，向他们保证他们的友好和感情。有一瞬间，那些面向他们的脸就像圣诞树上可怜的孩子们的脸。然后桌子突然破裂了——客人们被大胆地超越了欢乐气氛，进入了一种罕见的感伤气氛的那一刻，在他们还没有意识到它的存在之前，它就已经结束了。

But the diffused magic of the hot sweet South had withdrawn into them—the soft-pawed night and the ghostly wash of the Mediterranean far below—the magic left these things and melted into the two Divers and became part of them. Rosemary watched Nicole pressing upon her mother a yellow evening bag she had admired, saying, ‘I think things ought to belong to the people that like them’—and then sweeping into it all the yellow articles she could find, a pencil, a lipstick, a little note book, ‘because they all go together.’
但炎热甜蜜的南方的弥漫魔力已经退回到他们身上——柔软的夜色和远在下面的地中海幽灵般的水流——魔力离开了这些东西，融入了两个潜水者身上，成为他们的一部分。罗斯玛丽看着妮可把一个她很欣赏的黄色晚宴包按在她妈妈身上，说道：“我认为东西应该属于喜欢它们的人”——然后把她能找到的所有黄色物品都塞进去，一支铅笔，一支口红，一本小笔记本，“因为它们都是在一起的。”

Nicole disappeared and presently Rosemary noticed that Dick was no longer there; the guests distributed themselves in the garden or drifted in toward the terrace.
妮可消失了，不久罗斯玛丽注意到迪克已经不在了。客人们要么分布在花园里，要么走向露台。

‘Do you want,’ Violet McKisco asked Rosemary, ‘to go to the bathroom?’
“你想去洗手间吗？”维奥莱特·麦基斯科问罗斯玛丽。

Not at that precise moment.
不是在那一刻。

‘I want,’ insisted Mrs. McKisco, ‘to go to the bathroom.’ As a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house, dragging her secret after her, while Rosemary looked after with reprobation. Earl Brady proposed that they walk down to the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have a share of Dick Diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, listening to McKisco quarrel with Barban.
“我想要，”麦基斯科夫人坚持说，“去洗手间。”作为一个直言不讳的女人，她拖着她的秘密朝房子走去，而罗斯玛丽则带着责备的态度照顾着。厄尔·布雷迪提议他们走到海堤边，但当迪克·戴弗再次出现时，她觉得这是她分享他的时候了，所以她停了下来，听着麦基斯科和巴班的争吵。

‘Why do you want to fight the Soviets?’ McKisco said. ‘The greatest experiment ever made by humanity? And the Riff? It seems to me it would be more heroic to fight on the just side.’
“你为什么想与苏联作战？”麦基斯科说。 “人类有史以来最伟大的实验？还有即兴演奏？在我看来，站在正义一方战斗会更英勇。

‘How do you find out which it is?’ asked Barban dryly.
“你怎么知道那是哪一个？”巴尔班干巴巴地问。

‘Why—usually everybody intelligent knows.’
“为什么——通常每个聪明人都知道。”

‘Are you a Communist?’
“你是共产党员吗？”

‘I’m a Socialist,’ said McKisco, ‘I sympathize with Russia.’
“我是一名社会主义者，”麦基斯科说，“我同情俄罗斯。”

‘Well, I’m a soldier,’ Barban answered pleasantly. ‘My business is to kill people. I fought against the Riff because I am a European, and I have fought the Communists because they want to take my property from me.’
“嗯，我是一名士兵，”巴尔班愉快地回答道。 ‘我的职责就是杀人。我与 Riff 作战，因为我是欧洲人；我与共产党作战，因为他们想夺走我的财产。

‘Of all the narrow-minded excuses,’ McKisco looked around to establish a derisive liaison with some one else, but without success. He had no idea what he was up against in Barban, neither of the simplicity of the other man’s bag of ideas nor of the complexity of his training. McKisco knew what ideas were, and as his mind grew he was able to recognize and sort an increasing number of them—but faced by a man whom he considered ‘dumb,’ one in whom he found no ideas he could recognize as such, and yet to whom he could not feel personally superior, he jumped at the conclusion that Barban was the end product of an archaic world, and as such, worthless. McKisco’s contacts with the princely classes in America had impressed upon him their uncertain and fumbling snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their deliberate rudeness, all lifted from the English with no regard paid to factors that make English philistinism and rudeness purposeful, and applied in a land where a little knowledge and civility buy more than they do anywhere else—an attitude which reached its apogee in the ‘Harvard manner’ of about 1900. He thought that this Barban was of that type, and being drunk rashly forgot that he was in awe of him—this led up to the trouble in which he presently found himself.
“在所有狭隘的借口中，”麦基斯科环顾四周，想与其他人建立一种嘲笑的联系，但没有成功。他不知道自己在巴尔班要面对什么，也不知道对方的想法有多简单，也不知道他所接受的训练有多复杂。麦基斯科知道什么是想法，随着他心智的成长，他能够识别和分类越来越多的想法——但面对的是​​一个他认为“愚蠢”的人，他在这个人身上找不到他可以识别的想法，并且然而，他并没有觉得自己比巴尔班优越，他立刻得出这样的结论：巴尔班是一个古老世界的最终产物，因此毫无价值。麦基斯科与美国王公阶层的接触给他留下了深刻的印象：他们的不确定性和笨手笨脚的势利，他们对无知的喜悦和他们故意的粗鲁，所有这些都来自英国人，没有考虑到使英国庸俗和粗鲁有目的的因素，并应用于在这片土地上，一点点知识和礼貌比在其他任何地方都能买到更多的东西——这种态度在 1900 年左右的“哈佛方式”中达到了顶峰。他认为这个巴班就是这种类型，喝醉了草率地忘记了他是在对他的敬畏——这导致了他目前遇到的麻烦。

Feeling vaguely ashamed for McKisco, Rosemary waited, placid but inwardly on fire, for Dick Diver’s return. From her chair at the deserted table with Barban, McKisco, and Abe she looked up along the path edged with shadowy myrtle and fern to the stone terrace, and falling in love with her mother’s profile against a lighted door, was about to go there when Mrs. McKisco came hurrying down from the house.
罗斯玛丽隐约为麦基斯科感到羞愧，她平静地等待着迪克·戴弗的归来，但内心却火热无比。她坐在巴班、麦基斯科和亚伯那张空荡荡的桌子旁的椅子上，抬头沿着小路望去，小路两旁长满了阴暗的香桃木和蕨类植物，一直到石头露台，爱上了灯火通明的门上母亲的侧影，正要走到那儿时，麦基斯科太太急匆匆地从房子里跑下来。

She exuded excitement. In the very silence with which she pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes staring, her mouth working a little, they all recognized a person crop-full of news, and her husband’s ‘What’s the matter, Vi?’ came naturally, as all eyes turned toward her.
她流露出兴奋之情。在一片寂静中，她拉开椅子坐下，眼睛盯着，嘴巴动了一下，他们都认出了一个充满新闻的人，她丈夫的“怎么了，维？”自然而然地说道，当所有的目光都转向她时。

‘My dear—‘ she said at large, and then addressed Rosemary, ‘my dear—it’s nothing. I really can’t say a word.’
“亲爱的——”她大言不惭地说，然后对罗斯玛丽说道，“亲爱的——没什么。”我真的一句话也说不出来。

‘You’re among friends,’ said Abe.
“你们是朋友，”安倍说。

‘Well, upstairs I came upon a scene, my dears—‘
“嗯，我在楼上看到了一个场景，亲爱的——”

Shaking her head cryptically she broke off just in time, for Tommy arose and addressed her politely but sharply:
她神秘地摇摇头，及时打住了，因为汤米站起来，礼貌而尖锐地对她说话：

‘It’s inadvisable to comment on what goes on in this house.’
“不建议对这所房子里发生的事情发表评论。”

Violet breathed loud and hard once and with an effort brought another expression into her face.
维奥莱特急促地呼吸了一次，努力使脸上露出另一种表情。

Dick came finally and with a sure instinct he separated Barban and the McKiscos and became excessively ignorant and inquisitive about literature with McKisco—thus giving the latter the moment of superiority which he required. The others helped him carry lamps up—who would not be pleased at carrying lamps helpfully through the darkness? Rosemary helped, meanwhile responding patiently to Royal Dumphry’s inexhaustible curiosity about Hollywood.
迪克终于来了，凭着一种确定的本能，他将巴尔班和麦基斯科一家分开，并与麦基斯科一起对文学变得过分无知和好奇——从而给了后者他所需要的优越感。其他人帮他提灯——谁会不高兴在黑暗中提着灯呢？罗斯玛丽提供了帮助，同时耐心地回应了皇家邓弗里对好莱坞无穷无尽的好奇心。

Now—she was thinking—I’ve earned a time alone with him. He must know that because his laws are like the laws Mother taught me.
现在——她想——我已经赢得了和他单独相处的时间了。他一定知道这一点，因为他的法律就像母亲教给我的法律一样。

Rosemary was right—presently he detached her from the company on the terrace, and they were alone together, borne away from the house toward the seaside wall with what were less steps than irregularly spaced intervals through some of which she was pulled, through others blown.
罗斯玛丽是对的——不久他就把她从露台上的同伴中带走了，他们单独在一起，离开房子，走向海边的墙壁，步数比不规则间隔的步数要少，她被拉着穿过其中一些，穿过另一些被吹走。 。

They looked out over the Mediterranean. Far below, the last excursion boat from the Isles des Lerins floated across the bay like a Fourth-of-July balloon foot-loose in the heavens. Between the black isles it floated, softly parting the dark tide.
他们眺望地中海。在下面很远的地方，来自莱兰岛的最后一艘游览船像七月四日的气球一样漂浮在海湾上，在天空中自由自在。它漂浮在黑色岛屿之间，轻轻地分开黑暗的潮水。

‘I understand why you speak as you do of your mother,’ he said. ‘Her attitude toward you is very fine, I think. She has a sort of wisdom that’s rare in America.’
“我明白你为什么这样谈论你的母亲，”他说。 “我觉得她对你的态度很好。”她有一种在美国罕见的智慧。

‘Mother is perfect,’ she prayed.
“母亲是完美的，”她祈祷道。

‘I was talking to her about a plan I have—she told me that how long you both stayed in France depended on you.’
“我正在和她谈论我的一个计划——她告诉我，你们在法国待多久取决于你们。”

On YOU, Rosemary all but said aloud.
“关于你”，罗斯玛丽几乎大声说道。

‘So since things are over down here—‘
“既然这里的事情已经结束了——”

‘Over?’ she inquired.
“结束了？”她问道。

‘Well, this is over—this part of the summer is over. Last week Nicole’s sister left, to-morrow Tommy Barban leaves, Monday Abe and Mary North are leaving. Maybe we’ll have more fun this summer but this particular fun is over. I want it to die violently instead of fading out sentimentally—that’s why I gave this party. What I’m coming to is—Nicole and I are going up to Paris to see Abe North off for America—I wonder if you’d like to go with us.’
‘好吧，一切都结束了——夏天的这一部分已经结束了。上周妮可的姐姐离开了，明天汤米·巴班离开了，周一阿贝和玛丽·诺斯也离开了。也许今年夏天我们会玩得更开心，但这种特别的乐趣已经结束了。我希望它能猛烈地死去，而不是感伤地消失——这就是我举办这个聚会的原因。我要去的是——妮可和我要去巴黎送安倍·诺斯前往美国——我想知道你是否愿意和我们一起去。

‘What did Mother say?’
“妈妈说什么了？”

‘She seemed to think it would be fine. She doesn’t want to go herself. She wants you to go alone.’
‘她似乎认为这样就可以了。她不想自己去。她希望你一个人去。

‘I haven’t seen Paris since I’ve been grown,’ said Rosemary. ‘I’d love to see it with you.’
“自从我长大后，我就没有去过巴黎了，”罗斯玛丽说。 “我很想和你一起看看。​​”

‘That’s nice of you.’ Did she imagine that his voice was suddenly metallic? ‘Of course we’ve been excited about you from the moment you came on the beach. That vitality, we were sure it was professional—especially Nicole was. It’d never use itself up on any one person or group.’
“你真好。”她有没有想象到他的声音突然变得金属般的？ “当然，从你来到海滩的那一刻起，我们就一直为你感到兴奋。那种活力，我们确信它是专业的——尤其是妮可。它永远不会用在任何一个人或一个团体身上。”

Her instinct cried out to her that he was passing her along slowly toward Nicole and she put her own brakes on, saying with an equal harness:
她的本能向她呼喊，他正在慢慢地将她驶向妮可，她踩下了刹车，用同样的安全带说道：

‘I wanted to know all of you too—especially you. I told you I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.’
“我也想了解你们所有人——尤其是你。我告诉过你，我第一次见到你时就爱上了你。”

She was right going at it that way. But the space between heaven and earth had cooled his mind, destroyed the impulsiveness that had led him to bring her here, and made him aware of the too obvious appeal, the struggle with an unrehearsed scene and unfamiliar words.
她这样做是对的。但天地之间的空间却让他的心冷却了，摧毁了他带她来这里的冲动，让他意识到了过于明显的吸引力，与未排练过的场景和陌生话语的挣扎。

He tried now to make her want to go back to the house and it was difficult, and he did not quite want to lose her. She felt only the draft blowing as he joked with her good-humoredly.
他现在试图让她想回家，但这很困难，而且他不太想失去她。当他和她幽默地开玩笑时，她只感觉到风吹过。

‘You don’t know what you want. You go and ask your mother what you want.’
‘你不知道自己想要什么。你去问问你妈妈你想要什么。

She was stricken. She touched him, feeling the smooth cloth of his dark coat like a chasuble. She seemed about to fall to her knees— from that position she delivered her last shot.
她很受打击。她触碰他，感觉他深色外套的光滑布料就像一件祭服。她似乎就要跪下——从那个位置她发出了最后一枪。

‘I think you’re the most wonderful person I ever met—except my mother.’
“我认为你是我见过的最棒的人——除了我的母亲。”

‘You have romantic eyes.’
“你有一双浪漫的眼睛。”

His laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where he delivered her to Nicole... .
他的笑声把他们带向露台，在那里他把她交给了妮可……

Too soon it had become time to go and the Divers helped them all to go quickly. In the Divers’ big Isotta there would be Tommy Barban and his baggage—he was spending the night at the hotel to catch an early train—with Mrs. Abrams, the McKiscos and Campion. Earl Brady was going to drop Rosemary and her mother on his way to Monte Carlo, and Royal Dumphry rode with them because the Divers’ car was crowded. Down in the garden lanterns still glowed over the table where they had dined, as the Divers stood side by side in the gate, Nicole blooming away and filling the night with graciousness, and Dick bidding good-by to everyone by name. To Rosemary it seemed very poignant to drive away and leave them in their house. Again she wondered what Mrs. McKisco had seen in the bathroom.
很快就到了出发的时间，潜水员帮助他们所有人快速出发。在戴弗斯的大伊索塔里，汤米·巴尔班和他的行李——他在酒店过夜，赶早班火车——还有艾布拉姆斯夫人、麦基斯科夫妇和坎皮恩。厄尔·布雷迪打算送罗斯玛丽和她母亲去蒙特卡洛，罗亚尔·邓弗里和他们一起骑行，因为戴弗夫妇的车很拥挤。花园里的灯笼仍然在他们用餐的桌子上方闪闪发光，戴弗夫妇并排站在门口，妮可绽放光芒，让整个夜晚充满了亲切，迪克则点名向每个人道别。对罗斯玛丽来说，开车离开并把他们留在家里似乎非常令人心酸。她再次想知道麦基斯科太太在浴室里看到了什么。

IX

It was a limpid black night, hung as in a basket from a single dull star. The horn of the car ahead was muffled by the resistance of the thick air. Brady’s chauffeur drove slowly; the tail-light of the other car appeared from time to time at turnings—then not at all. But after ten minutes it came into sight again, drawn up at the side of the road. Brady’s chauffeur slowed up behind but immediately it began to roll forward slowly and they passed it. In the instant they passed it they heard a blur of voices from behind the reticence of the limousine and saw that the Divers’ chauffeur was grinning. Then they went on, going fast through the alternating banks of darkness and thin night, descending at last in a series of roller-coaster swoops, to the great bulk of Gausse’s hotel.
这是一个清澈的黑夜，就像挂在篮子里的一颗暗淡的星星。前方汽车的喇叭声因浓重空气的阻力而变得低沉。布雷迪的司机开得很慢。转弯时另一辆车的尾灯时不时地亮起来，然后就完全不亮了。但十分钟后，它又出现了，停在路边。布雷迪的司机在后面放慢了速度，但它立即开始缓慢地向前滚动，他们超越了它。就在他们经过它的那一刻，他们听到沉默的豪华轿车后面传来模糊的声音，看到戴弗斯的司机正在咧着嘴笑。然后他们继续前行，快速穿过黑暗和薄夜交替的河岸，最后以一系列过山车的速度下降，到达高斯酒店的大部分区域。

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother’s mind about the question. In this process she was often acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had gone into her half-heard.
迷迭香睡了三个小时，然后醒着，悬浮在月光下。被色情的黑暗所掩盖，她很快就耗尽了未来，所有可能导致接吻的可能性，但亲吻本身就像照片中的亲吻一样模糊。她故意改变了床上的姿势，这是她失眠的第一个迹象，并试图用母亲的想法来思考这个问题。在这个过程中，她的敏锐程度往往超出了她的经验，她还记得一些以前的谈话内容，而这些内容她以前的谈话却很少听到。

Rosemary had been brought up with the idea of work. Mrs. Speers had spent the slim leavings of the men who had widowed her on her daughter’s education, and when she blossomed out at sixteen with that extraordinary hair, rushed her to Aix-les-Bains and marched her unannounced into the suite of an American producer who was recuperating there. When the producer went to New York they went too. Thus Rosemary had passed her entrance examinations. With the ensuing success and the promise of comparative stability that followed, Mrs. Speers had felt free to tacitly imply tonight:
罗斯玛丽是在工作观念的熏陶下长大的。斯皮尔斯夫人把那些使她成为寡妇的男人们所剩无几的遗产都花在了她女儿的教育上，当她十六岁那年长出一头非凡的头发时，她急忙把她赶到艾克斯莱班，不请自来地把她带进了一个美国人的套房。在那里养伤的制片人。当制片人去纽约时，他们也去了。就这样，罗斯玛丽通过了入学考试。随着随之而来的成功和随之而来的相对稳定的承诺，斯皮尔斯夫人今晚随意地默认暗示：

‘You were brought up to work—not especially to marry. Now you’ve found your first nut to crack and it’s a good nut—go ahead and put whatever happens down to experience. Wound yourself or him— whatever happens it can’t spoil you because economically you’re a boy, not a girl.’
“你从小就是为了工作而长大的——不是特别为了结婚。现在你已经找到了第一个要破解的难题，而且这是一个好难题——继续吧，把发生的任何事情都记录下来。伤害你自己或他——无论发生什么，都不会宠坏你，因为从经济上来说你是一个男孩，而不是一个女孩。

Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the illimitability of her mother’s perfections, so this final severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet. There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.
罗斯玛丽从来没有思考过太多，除了她母亲的完美的无限性之外，所以脐带的最后切断扰乱了她的睡眠。虚假的黎明把天空压进了高高的落地窗，她起身走到露台上，赤脚感到温暖。空气中传来秘密的噪音，一只顽固的鸟儿在网球场上方的树上规律地取得了邪恶的胜利；脚步声沿着酒店后面的一条环形车道传来，依次从尘土路、碎石路、水泥台阶上走来，然后又以相反的方式离开。在漆黑的大海彼岸，在那座高高的黑色山影的远处，住着戴弗人。她想起他们俩在一起，听见他们还在淡淡地唱着一首歌，如升腾的炊烟，如一首赞美诗，时间很遥远，很遥远。他们的孩子们都睡了，他们的门整夜都关着。

She went inside and dressing in a light gown and espadrilles went out her window again and along the continuous terrace toward the front door, going fast since she found that other private rooms, exuding sleep, gave upon it. She stopped at the sight of a figure seated on the wide white stairway of the formal entrance—then she saw that it was Luis Campion and that he was weeping.
她走进去，穿上浅色长袍和帆布鞋，再次走出窗外，沿着连续的露台朝前门走去，因为她发现其他私人房间都散发着睡意，所以走得很快。当她看到一个人影坐在正式入口的宽阔白色楼梯上时，她停了下来——然后她看到那是路易斯·坎皮恩，他正在哭泣。

He was weeping hard and quietly and shaking in the same parts as a weeping woman. A scene in a role she had played last year swept over her irresistibly and advancing she touched him on the shoulder. He gave a little yelp before he recognized her.
他低声哭泣，全身颤抖，就像一个哭泣的女人。去年她扮演的一个角色中的一个场景不可抗拒地掠过她的脑海，她向前触碰了他的肩膀。他轻声叫了一声，才认出了她。

‘What is it?’ Her eyes were level and kind and not slanted into him with hard curiosity. ‘Can I help you?’
“什么事？”她的眼睛平视而友善，并没有带着强烈的好奇心斜视着他。 '我可以帮你吗？'

‘Nobody can help me. I knew it. I have only myself to blame. It’s always the same.’
‘没有人能帮助我。我就知道。我只能责怪我自己。总是一样的。

‘What is it—do you want to tell me?’
“这是什么——你想告诉我吗？”

He looked at her to see.
他看着她。

‘No,’ he decided. ‘When you’re older you’ll know what people who love suffer. The agony. It’s better to be cold and young than to love. It’s happened to me before but never like this—so accidental—just when everything was going well.’
“不，”他决定。 “等你长大了，你就会知道相爱的人所受的苦。痛苦。冷漠而年轻，比去爱要好。我以前也发生过这种事，但从来没有像现在这样——太意外了——就在一切进展顺利的时候。”

His face was repulsive in the quickening light. Not by a flicker of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle, did she betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was. But Campion’s sensitivity realized it and he changed the subject rather suddenly.
在越来越亮的光线下，他的脸显得令人厌恶。她的性格中的任何一闪而过，哪怕是最小的肌肉的一动，都没有暴露出她对任何事物突然感到的厌恶。但坎皮恩的敏感意识到了这一点，他突然改变了话题。

‘Abe North is around here somewhere.’
“阿贝·诺斯就在这附近的某个地方。”

‘Why, he’s staying at the Divers’!’
“为什么，他住在潜水员队”！

‘Yes, but he’s up—don’t you know what happened?’
“是的，但是他醒了——你不知道发生了什么事吗？”

A shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above and an English voice spat distinctly:
两层楼上一间房间的百叶窗突然打开，一个英国声音清晰地吐出：

‘Will you kaindlay stup tucking!’
“你能帮坎德利掖好被子吗？”

Rosemary and Luis Campion went humbly down the steps and to a bench beside the road to the beach.
罗斯玛丽和路易斯·坎皮恩谦虚地走下台阶，来到通往海滩的路边的一张长凳上。

‘Then you have no idea what’s happened? My dear, the most extraordinary thing—‘ He was warming up now, hanging on to his revelation. ‘I’ve never seen a thing come so suddenly—I have always avoided violent people—they upset me so I sometimes have to go to bed for days.’
‘那你不知道发生了什么吗？亲爱的，最不寻常的事情是——”他现在正在热身，紧紧抓住他的启示。 “我从来没有见过事情来得如此突然——我总是避开暴力的人——他们让我心烦意乱，所以有时我不得不上床睡觉好几天。”

He looked at her triumphantly. She had no idea what he was talking about.
他得意地看着她。她不知道他在说什么。

‘My dear,’ he burst forth, leaning toward her with his whole body as he touched her on the upper leg, to show it was no mere irresponsible venture of his hand—he was so sure of himself. ‘There’s going to be a duel.’
“亲爱的，”他大声说道，用整个身体向她倾斜，触摸她的大腿，以表明他的手不仅仅是不负责任的冒险——他对自己非常有信心。 “将会有一场决斗。”

‘Wh-at?’
'什么？'

‘A duel with—we don’t know what yet.’
“一场决斗——我们还不知道会发生什么。”

‘Who’s going to duel?’
“谁要决斗？”

‘I’ll tell you from the beginning.’ He drew a long breath and then said, as if it were rather to her discredit but he wouldn’t hold it against her. ‘Of course, you were in the other automobile. Well, in a way you were lucky—I lost at least two years of my life, it came so suddenly.’
“我会从头开始告诉你。”他长长地吸了一口气，然后说道，好像这很让她蒙羞，但他不会因此而责备她。 “当然，你在另一辆车里。好吧，从某种程度上来说，你很幸运——我至少失去了两年的生命，这一切来得太突然了。

‘What came?’ she demanded.
“发生了什么？”她问道。

‘I don’t know what began it. First she began to talk—‘
‘我不知道是什么开始的。首先她开始说话——‘

‘Who?’
'WHO？'

‘Violet McKisco.’ He lowered his voice as if there were people under the bench. ‘But don’t mention the Divers because he made threats against anybody who mentioned it.’
“维奥莱特·麦基斯科。”他压低了声音，仿佛板凳下还有人。 “但是不要提到戴弗斯，因为他对任何提到这件事的人都发出了威胁。”

‘Who did?’
'谁干的？'

‘Tommy Barban, so don’t you say I so much as mentioned them. None of us ever found out anyhow what it was Violet had to say because he kept interrupting her, and then her husband got into it and now, my dear, we have the duel. This morning—at five o’clock—in an hour.’ He sighed suddenly thinking of his own griefs. ‘I almost wish it were I. I might as well be killed now I have nothing to live for.’ He broke off and rocked to and fro with sorrow.
“汤米·巴尔班，你别说我提到过他们了。”无论如何，我们谁也不知道维奥莱特要说什么，因为他一直打断她，然后她的丈夫介入了，现在，亲爱的，我们决斗了。今天早上——五点钟——再过一个小时。”想到自己的悲伤，他突然叹了口气。 “我几乎希望是我。现在我已经没有什么活下去的理由了，还不如被杀了。”他停住了，悲伤地摇晃着。

Again the iron shutter parted above and the same British voice said:
上面的铁百叶窗再次分开，同一个英国人的声音说道：

‘Rilly, this must stup immejetely.’
“里利，这一定会立即停止。”

Simultaneously Abe North, looking somewhat distracted, came out of the hotel, perceived them against the sky, white over the sea. Rosemary shook her head warningly before he could speak and they moved another bench further down the road. Rosemary saw that Abe was a little tight.
与此同时，阿贝·诺斯（Abe North）走出酒店，看上去有些心烦意乱，他看到他们在天空的映衬下，白色的海面。在他开口说话之前，罗斯玛丽警告性地摇了摇头，然后他们又搬了一张长凳到路边。罗斯玛丽看出阿部有些紧张。

‘What are YOU doing up?’ he demanded.
“你在做什么？”他问道。

‘I just got up.’ She started to laugh, but remembering the voice above, she restrained herself.
“我刚起床。”她开始笑，但想起上面的声音，她克制住了自己。

‘Plagued by the nightingale,’ Abe suggested, and repeated, ‘probably plagued by the nightingale. Has this sewing-circle member told you what happened?’
“被夜莺困扰了，”亚伯建议道，并重复道，“可能是被夜莺困扰了。”这位缝纫界的成员告诉你发生了什么事吗？

Campion said with dignity:
坎皮恩郑重地说：

‘I only know what I heard with my own ears.’
“我只知道我亲耳听到的。”

He got up and walked swiftly away; Abe sat down beside Rosemary.
他站起身来，快步走开。阿部在罗斯玛丽旁边坐下。

‘Why did you treat him so badly?’
“你为什么对他这么不好？”

‘Did I?’ he asked surprised. ‘He’s been weeping around here all morning.’
“是吗？”他惊讶地问道。 “他整个早上都在这里哭泣。”

‘Well, maybe he’s sad about something.’
“嗯，也许他正在为某件事感到难过。”

‘Maybe he is.’
“也许他是。”

‘What about a duel? Who’s going to duel? I thought there was something strange in that car. Is it true?’
‘决斗怎么样？谁要决斗？我觉得那辆车里有什么奇怪的东西。这是真的吗？

‘It certainly is coo-coo but it seems to be true.’
“这确实很酷，但似乎是真的。”

X

The trouble began at the time Earl Brady’s car passed the Divers’ car stopped on the road—Abe’s account melted impersonally into the thronged night—Violet McKisco was telling Mrs. Abrams something she had found out about the Divers—she had gone upstairs in their house and she had come upon something there which had made a great impression on her. But Tommy is a watch-dog about the Divers. As a matter of fact she is inspiring and formidable—but it’s a mutual thing, and the fact of The Divers together is more important to their friends than many of them realize. Of course it’s done at a certain sacrifice—sometimes they seem just rather charming figures in a ballet, and worth just the attention you give a ballet, but it’s more than that—you’d have to know the story. Anyhow Tommy is one of those men that Dick’s passed along to Nicole and when Mrs. McKisco kept hinting at her story, he called them on it. He said:
麻烦是在厄尔·布雷迪的车经过戴弗夫妇的车停在路上的时候开始的——亚伯的叙述客观地融入了拥挤的夜晚——维奥莱特·麦基斯科正在告诉艾布拉姆斯太太一些她发现的有关戴弗夫妇的事情——她开着他们的车上楼了。她在那里发现了一些给她留下深刻印象的东西。但汤米是潜水员队的看门狗。事实上，她鼓舞人心且令人敬畏，但这是一件共同的事情，而潜水员在一起的事实对他们的朋友来说比他们中的许多人意识到的更重要。当然，这是有一定牺牲的——有时他们看起来只是芭蕾舞中相当迷人的人物，值得你给予芭蕾舞的关注，但更重要的是——你必须了解这个故事。不管怎样，汤米是迪克传给妮可的那些人之一，当麦基斯科夫人不断暗示她的故事时，他呼吁他们这样做。他说：

‘Mrs. McKisco, please don’t talk further about Mrs. Diver.’
'太太。麦基斯科，请不要再谈论戴弗夫人了。

‘I wasn’t talking to you,’ she objected.
“我不是在跟你说话，”她反对道。

‘I think it’s better to leave them out.’
“我认为最好把它们排除在外。”

‘Are they so sacred?’
“它们有那么神圣吗？”

‘Leave them out. Talk about something else.’
‘把他们排除在外。谈谈别的事吧。

He was sitting on one of the two little seats beside Campion. Campion told me the story.
他坐在坎皮恩旁边的两个小座位之一上。坎皮恩给我讲了这个故事。

‘Well, you’re pretty high-handed,’ Violet came back.
“好吧，你太霸道了，”维奥莱特回答道。

You know how conversations are in cars late at night, some people murmuring and some not caring, giving up after the party, or bored or asleep. Well, none of them knew just what happened until the car stopped and Barban cried in a voice that shook everybody, a voice for cavalry.
你知道深夜车里的谈话是怎样的，有人低声说话，有人漠不关心，聚会结束后就放弃了，或者无聊或睡着了。好吧，他们谁也不知道到底发生了什么事，直到汽车停下来，巴尔班用一种让所有人震惊的声音哭了起来，这是骑兵的声音。

‘Do you want to step out here—we’re only a mile from the hotel and you can walk it or I’ll drag you there. YOU’VE GOT TO SHUT UP AND SHUT YOUR WIFE UP!’
“你想出去吗——我们离酒店只有一英里，你可以步行过去，否则我会把你拖到那里。”你必须闭嘴，也让你的妻子闭嘴！

‘You’re a bully,’ said McKisco. ‘You know you’re stronger muscularly than I am. But I’m not afraid of you—what they ought to have is the code duello—‘
“你是个恶霸，”麦基斯科说。 “你知道你的肌肉比我强壮。但我不怕你——他们应该拥有的是决斗密码——”

There’s where he made his mistake because Tommy, being French, leaned over and clapped him one, and then the chauffeur drove on. That was where you passed them. Then the women began. That was still the state of things when the car got to the hotel.
他犯了一个错误，因为汤米是法国人，俯身给了他一巴掌，然后司机继续开车。那就是你经过他们的地方。然后女人们开始了。车子到了酒店的时候，情况还是这样。

Tommy telephoned some man in Cannes to act as second and McKisco said he wasn’t going to be seconded by Campion, who wasn’t crazy for the job anyhow, so he telephoned me not to say anything but to come right down. Violet McKisco collapsed and Mrs. Abrams took her to her room and gave her a bromide whereupon she fell comfortably asleep on the bed. When I got there I tried to argue with Tommy but the latter wouldn’t accept anything short of an apology and McKisco rather spunkily wouldn’t give it.
汤米打电话给戛纳的一个人担任副手，麦基斯科说他不会被坎皮恩借调，无论如何，坎皮恩并不热衷于这份工作，所以他打电话给我，什么也没说，只是让我下来。维奥莱特·麦基斯科倒下了，艾布拉姆斯夫人把她带到自己的房间，给了她一剂溴化物，然后她在床上舒服地睡着了。当我到达那里时，我试图与汤米争论，但后者除了道歉之外不会接受任何道歉，而麦基斯科则相当勇敢地拒绝道歉。

When Abe had finished Rosemary asked thoughtfully:
当亚伯说完后，罗斯玛丽若有所思地问道：

‘Do the Divers know it was about them?’
“潜水员知道这是关于他们的吗？”

‘No—and they’re not ever going to know they had anything to do with it. That damn Campion had no business talking to you about it, but since he did—I told the chauffeur I’d get out the old musical saw if he opened his mouth about it. This fight’s between two men—what Tommy needs is a good war.’
“不——他们永远不会知道他们与这件事有任何关系。那个该死的坎皮恩无权和你谈论这件事，但既然他说了——我告诉司机，如果他开口谈论这件事，我就拿出那把旧音乐锯。这场战斗是两个人之间的战斗——汤米需要的是一场精彩的战争。

‘I hope the Divers don’t find out,’ Rosemary said.
“我希望潜水员们不会发现，”罗斯玛丽说。

Abe peered at his watch.
阿部看了看手表。

‘I’ve got to go up and see McKisco—do you want to come?—he feels sort of friendless—I bet he hasn’t slept.’
“我得上去看看麦基斯科——你想来吗？——他感觉有点没有朋友——我敢打赌他还没睡。”

Rosemary had a vision of the desperate vigil that high-strung, badly organized man had probably kept. After a moment balanced between pity and repugnance she agreed, and full of morning energy, bounced upstairs beside Abe.
罗斯玛丽看到了一个高度紧张、组织混乱的人可能一直保持的那种绝望的守夜状态。在怜悯和反感之间平衡了一会儿后，她同意了，并充满早晨的活力，弹跳上楼，在阿贝身边。

McKisco was sitting on his bed with his alcoholic combativeness vanished, in spite of the glass of champagne in his hand. He seemed very puny and cross and white. Evidently he had been writing and drinking all night. He stared confusedly at Abe and Rosemary and asked:
麦基斯科坐在床上，尽管手里拿着一杯香槟，但酒精带来的好斗情绪却消失了。他看起来非常瘦小，脾气暴躁，皮肤白皙。显然他整晚都在一边喝酒一边写作。他疑惑地看着亚伯和罗斯玛丽问道：

‘Is it time?’
“时间到了吗？”

‘No, not for half an hour.’
“不，半小时内不行。”

The table was covered with papers which he assembled with some difficulty into a long letter; the writing on the last pages was very large and illegible. In the delicate light of electric lamps fading, he scrawled his name at the bottom, crammed it into an envelope and handed it to Abe. ‘For my wife.’
桌子上堆满了文件，他费了好大劲才将这些文件拼凑成一封长信。最后几页的字迹很大，难以辨认。在电灯渐渐暗淡的柔和灯光下，他在底部潦草地写下了自己的名字，把它塞进一个信封里，递给了阿部。 “为了我的妻子。”

‘You better souse your head in cold water,’ Abe suggested.
“你最好把头浸入冷水中，”安倍建议道。

‘You think I’d better?’ inquired McKisco doubtfully. ‘I don’t want to get too sober.’
“你认为我会更好吗？”麦基斯科疑惑地问道。 “我不想太清醒。”

‘Well, you look terrible now.’
“好吧，你现在看起来很糟糕。”

Obediently McKisco went into the bathroom.
麦基斯科顺从地走进了浴室。

‘I’m leaving everything in an awful mess,’ he called. ‘I don’t know how Violet will get back to America. I don’t carry any insurance. I never got around to it.’
“我把一切都弄得一团糟，”他喊道。 “我不知道维奥莱特将如何回到美国。我没有任何保险。我从来没有抽出时间去做这件事。

‘Don’t talk nonsense, you’ll be right here eating breakfast in an hour.’
“别废话了，一个小时后你就在这里吃早餐了。”

‘Sure, I know.’ He came back with his hair wet and looked at Rosemary as if he saw her for the first time. Suddenly tears stood in his eyes. ‘I never have finished my novel. That’s what makes me so sore. You don’t like me,’ he said to Rosemary, ‘but that can’t be helped. I’m primarily a literary man.’ He made a vague discouraged sound and shook his head helplessly. ‘I’ve made lots of mistakes in my life—many of them. But I’ve been one of the most prominent—in some ways—‘
“当然，我知道。”他回来时头发湿漉漉的，看着罗斯玛丽，就像第一次见到她一样。突然，他的眼里充满了泪水。 “我的小说还没有完成。这就是让我如此痛苦的原因。你不喜欢我，”他对罗斯玛丽说，“但这也是没办法的事。我主要是个文学人。”他发出含糊的沮丧声音，无奈地摇摇头。 “我一生中犯过很多错误——很多。但从某些方面来说，我一直是最杰出的人之一。”

He gave this up and puffed at a dead cigarette.
他放弃了这个念头，吸了一口已经熄灭的香烟。

‘I do like you,’ said Rosemary, ‘but I don’t think you ought to fight a duel.’
“我确实喜欢你，”罗斯玛丽说，“但我认为你不应该决斗。”

‘Yeah, I should have tried to beat him up, but it’s done now. I’ve let myself be drawn into something that I had no right to be. I have a very violent temper—‘ He looked closely at Abe as if he expected the statement to be challenged. Then with an aghast laugh he raised the cold cigarette butt toward his mouth. His breathing quickened.
“是的，我应该尝试殴打他，但现在已经完成了。我让自己陷入了一些我无权陷入的境地。我的脾气很暴躁——”他仔细地看着安倍，仿佛他预料到这一说法会受到质疑。然后他惊愕地大笑起来，把冰冷的烟头举到嘴边。他的呼吸变得急促。

‘The trouble was I suggested the duel—if Violet had only kept her mouth shut I could have fixed it. Of course even now I can just leave, or sit back and laugh at the whole thing—but I don’t think Violet would ever respect me again.’
“问题是我建议决斗——如果维奥莱特闭嘴的话我就能解决这个问题。当然，即使现在我也可以离开，或者坐下来嘲笑整件事——但我认为维奥莱特不会再尊重我了。

‘Yes, she would,’ said Rosemary. ‘She’d respect you more.’
“是的，她会的，”罗斯玛丽说。 “她会更尊重你。”

‘No—you don’t know Violet. She’s very hard when she gets an advantage over you. We’ve been married twelve years, we had a little girl seven years old and she died and after that you know how it is. We both played around on the side a little, nothing serious but drifting apart—she called me a coward out there tonight.’
“不——你不了解维奥莱特。当她比你有优势时，她会非常努力。我们结婚十二年了，我们有一个七岁的小女孩，她去世了，之后你就知道是怎么回事了。我们俩都在旁边玩了一下，没什么大不了的，只是渐行渐远——她今晚在外面说我是胆小鬼。

Troubled, Rosemary didn’t answer.
迷迭香有些困惑，没有回答。

‘Well, we’ll see there’s as little damage done as possible,’ said Abe. He opened the leather case. ‘These are Barban’s duelling pistols—I borrowed them so you could get familiar with them. He carries them in his suitcase.’ He weighed one of the archaic weapons in his hand. Rosemary gave an exclamation of uneasiness and McKisco looked at the pistols anxiously.
“好吧，我们会尽量减少损失，”安倍说。他打开皮箱。 “这些是巴班的决斗手枪——我借用它们是为了让你熟悉一下。他把它们放在手提箱里。”他掂了掂手中一把古老武器的重量。罗斯玛丽不安地叫了一声，麦基斯科焦急地看着手枪。

‘Well—it isn’t as if we were going to stand up and pot each other with forty-fives,’ he said.
“嗯——我们并不是要站起来互相打出四十五分，”他说。

‘I don’t know,’ said Abe cruelly; ‘the idea is you can sight better along a long barrel.’
“我不知道，”阿贝残酷地说。 “这个想法是你可以沿着长桶看得更清楚。”

‘How about distance?’ asked McKisco.
“距离怎么样？”麦基斯科问道。

‘I’ve inquired about that. If one or the other parties has to be definitely eliminated they make it eight paces, if they’re just good and sore it’s twenty paces, and if it’s only to vindicate their honor it’s forty paces. His second agreed with me to make it forty.’
‘我已经询问过了。如果一方或另一方必须被绝对淘汰，他们就走八步，如果他们只是好又痛，就走二十步，如果只是为了维护自己的荣誉，就走四十步。他的第二个同意我把它定为四十。

‘That’s good.’
'那挺好的。'

‘There’s a wonderful duel in a novel of Pushkin’s,’ recollected Abe. ‘Each man stood on the edge of a precipice, so if he was hit at all he was done for.’
“普希金的小说里有一场精彩的决斗，”阿部回忆道。 “每个人都站在悬崖边缘，所以如果他被击中，他就完蛋了。”

This seemed very remote and academic to McKisco, who stared at him and said, ‘What?’
对于麦基斯科来说，这似乎非常遥远和学术，他盯着他说：“什么？”

‘Do you want to take a quick dip and freshen up?’
“你想快速泡个澡，恢复一下精神吗？”

‘No—no, I couldn t swim.’ He sighed. ‘I don’t see what it’s all about,’ he said helplessly. ‘I don’t see why I’m doing it.’
“不——不，我不会游泳。”他叹了口气。 “我不明白这是怎么回事，”他无助地说。 “我不明白我为什么要这么做。”

It was the first thing he had ever done in his life. Actually he was one of those for whom the sensual world does not exist, and faced with a concrete fact he brought to it a vast surprise.
这是他一生中所做的第一件事。事实上，他是那些不存在感官世界的人之一，面对一个具体的事实，他给它带来了巨大的惊讶。

‘We might as well be going,’ said Abe, seeing him fail a little.
“我们还是走吧，”阿贝看着他有点失败，说道。

‘All right.’ He drank off a stiff drink of brandy, put the flask in his pocket, and said with almost a savage air: ‘What’ll happen if I kill him—will they throw me in jail?’
“好吧。”他喝掉了一杯烈性白兰地，把瓶子放进口袋里，用近乎野蛮的神情说道：“如果我杀了他会怎样——他们会把我扔进监狱吗？”

‘I’ll run you over the Italian border.’
“我会带你穿过意大利边境。”

He glanced at Rosemary—and then said apologetically to Abe:
他看了一眼罗斯玛丽——然后抱歉地对亚伯说道：

‘Before we start there’s one thing I’d like to see you about alone.’
“在我们开始之前，我想单独见你一件事。”

‘I hope neither of you gets hurt,’ Rosemary said. ‘I think it’s very foolish and you ought to try to stop it.’
“我希望你们都没有受伤，”罗斯玛丽说。 “我认为这是非常愚蠢的，你应该尽力阻止它。”

XI

She found Campion downstairs in the deserted lobby.
她在楼下空荡荡的大厅里找到了坎皮恩。

‘I saw you go upstairs,’ he said excitedly. ‘Is he all right? When is the duel going to be?’
“我看见你上楼了，”他兴奋地说。 ‘他还好吗？决斗什么时候进行？

‘I don’t know.’ She resented his speaking of it as a circus, with McKisco as the tragic clown.
“我不知道。”她讨厌他把这说成是马戏团，麦基斯科是悲剧小丑。

‘Will you go with me?’ he demanded, with the air of having seats. ‘I’ve hired the hotel car.’
“你愿意和我一起去吗？”他问道，一副有座位的样子。 “我租了酒店的车。”

‘I don’t want to go.’
“我不想去。”

‘Why not? I imagine it’ll take years off my life but I wouldn’t miss it for worlds. We could watch it from quite far away.’
'为什么不？我想这会花费我几年的时间，但我不会错过它。我们可以从很远的地方观看它。

‘Why don’t you get Mr. Dumphry to go with you?’
“你为什么不让邓弗里先生和你一起去呢？”

His monocle fell out, with no whiskers to hide in—he drew himself up.
他的单片眼镜掉了，连胡须都没有藏身之处——他挺直了身子。

‘I never want to see him again.’
“我再也不想见到他了。”

‘Well, I’m afraid I can’t go. Mother wouldn’t like it.’
‘好吧，恐怕我不能去。妈妈不会喜欢的。

As Rosemary entered her room Mrs. Speers stirred sleepily and called to her:
当罗斯玛丽走进她的房间时，斯皮尔斯夫人睡眼惺忪地动了动，对她喊道：

‘Where’ve you been?’
“你去哪儿了？”

‘I just couldn’t sleep. You go back to sleep, Mother.’
“我就是睡不着。你回去睡觉吧，妈妈。”

‘Come in my room.’ Hearing her sit up in bed, Rosemary went in and told her what had happened.
“到我的房间来。”听到她从床上坐起来，罗斯玛丽走进去告诉她发生了什么事。

‘Why don’t you go and see it?’ Mrs. Speers suggested. ‘You needn’t go up close and you might be able to help afterwards.’
“你为什么不去看看呢？”斯皮尔斯夫人建议道。 “你不必靠近，事后也许能帮忙。”

Rosemary did not like the picture of herself looking on and she demurred, but Mrs. Speer’s consciousness was still clogged with sleep and she was reminded of night calls to death and calamity when she was the wife of a doctor. ‘I like you to go places and do things on your own initiative without me—you did much harder things for Rainy’s publicity stunts.’
罗斯玛丽不喜欢自己在旁观的画面，她提出了异议，但斯佩尔夫人的意识仍然被睡眠所堵塞，她想起了当她是医生的妻子时，夜间的死亡和灾难的召唤。 “我喜欢你在没有我的情况下主动去一些地方做事——你为雷尼的宣传噱头做了更困难的事情。”

Still Rosemary did not see why she should go, but she obeyed the sure, clear voice that had sent her into the stage entrance of the Odeon in Paris when she was twelve and greeted her when she came out again.
罗斯玛丽仍然不明白自己为什么要走，但她服从了那坚定、清晰的声音，那声音在她十二岁时送她进入巴黎剧院的舞台入口，并在她再次出来时向她打招呼。

She thought she was reprieved when from the steps she saw Abe and McKisco drive away—but after a moment the hotel car came around the corner. Squealing delightedly Luis Campion pulled her in beside him.
当她从台阶上看到安倍和麦基斯科开车离开时，她以为自己得到了缓刑——但过了一会儿，酒店的车就从拐角处驶来。路易斯·坎皮恩高兴地尖叫着，把她拉到自己身边。

‘I hid there because they might not let us come. I’ve got my movie camera, you see.’
“我躲在那里，因为他们可能不让我们来。我有我的电影摄影机，你看。

She laughed helplessly. He was so terrible that he was no longer terrible, only dehumanized.
她无奈地笑道。他太可怕了，不再可怕，只是失去人性。

‘I wonder why Mrs. McKisco didn’t like the Divers?’ she said. ‘They were very nice to her.’
“我想知道为什么麦基斯科夫人不喜欢戴弗夫妇？”她说。 “他们对她很好。”

‘Oh, it wasn’t that. It was something she saw. We never did find exactly what it was because of Barban.’
‘噢，不是那样的。这是她看到的东西。我们一直没有找到到底是什么原因，因为巴尔班。”

‘Then that wasn’t what made you so sad.’
“那么这并不是让你如此悲伤的原因。”

‘Oh, no,’ he said, his voice breaking, ‘that was something else that happened when we got back to the hotel. But now I don’t care— I wash my hands of it completely.’
“哦，不，”他声音沙哑地说，“那是我们回到酒店后发生的另一件事。”但现在我不在乎了——我彻底洗手了。”

They followed the other car east along the shore past Juan les Pins, where the skeleton of the new Casino was rising. It was past four and under a blue-gray sky the first fishing boats were creaking out into a glaucous sea. Then they turned off the main road and into the back country.
他们跟着另一辆车沿着海岸向东经过胡安莱潘，那里新赌场的骨架正在拔地而起。已经四点多了，蓝灰色的天空下，第一批渔船嘎吱嘎吱地驶入碧蓝的大海。然后他们离开主干道，进入偏远地区。

‘It’s the golf course,’ cried Campion, ‘I’m sure that’s where it’s going to be.’
“这是高尔夫球场，”坎皮恩喊道，“我确信那就是它所在的地方。”

He was right. When Abe’s car pulled up ahead of them the east was crayoned red and yellow, promising a sultry day. Ordering the hotel car into a grove of pines Rosemary and Campion kept in the shadow of a wood and skirted the bleached fairway where Abe and McKisco were walking up and down, the latter raising his head at intervals like a rabbit scenting. Presently there were moving figures over by a farther tee and the watchers made out Barban and his French second—the latter carried the box of pistols under his arm.
他是对的。当安倍的车停在他们前面时，东方被蜡笔涂成红色和黄色，预示着这一天会很闷热。罗斯玛丽和坎皮恩命令酒店的车开进一片松树林，他们躲在树林的阴影里，沿着漂白的球道走来走去，阿部和麦基斯科在球道上走来走去，后者时不时地抬起头，就像一只兔子在嗅觉。不久，远处的发球台旁出现了移动的人影，观察者认出了巴尔班和他的法国副手——后者腋下夹着一盒手枪。

Somewhat appalled, McKisco slipped behind Abe and took a long swallow of brandy. He walked on choking and would have marched directly up into the other party, but Abe stopped him and went forward to talk to the Frenchman. The sun was over the horizon.
麦基斯科有些震惊，溜到阿部身后，喝了一大口白兰地。他走得哽咽，本来想直接走向对方，但阿部拦住了他，上前与法国人交谈。太阳已经超出了地平线。

Campion grabbed Rosemary’s arm.
坎皮恩抓住罗斯玛丽的手臂。

‘I can’t stand it,’ he squeaked, almost voiceless. ‘It’s too much. This will cost me—‘
“我受不了了，”他几乎无声地尖叫道。 '太多了。这会让我付出代价——”

‘Let go,’ Rosemary said peremptorily. She breathed a frantic prayer in French.
“放手，”罗斯玛丽专横地说。她用法语疯狂地祈祷。

The principals faced each other, Barban with the sleeve rolled up from his arm. His eyes gleamed restlessly in the sun, but his motion was deliberate as he wiped his palm on the seam of his trousers. McKisco, reckless with brandy, pursed his lips in a whistle and pointed his long nose about nonchalantly, until Abe stepped forward with a handkerchief in his hand. The French second stood with his face turned away. Rosemary caught her breath in terrible pity and gritted her teeth with hatred for Barban; then:
校长们面对面，巴尔班挽起了手臂的袖子。他的眼睛在阳光下闪烁着不安的光芒，但当他用手掌在裤缝上擦拭时，他的动作却是从容的。麦基斯科不顾一切地喝着白兰地，噘起嘴唇，吹着口哨，漫不经心地用长鼻子指着四周，直到阿部手里拿着一块手帕走上前来。法国二号站着，转过脸去。罗斯玛丽屏住了呼吸，心中充满了可怕的怜悯，对巴尔班的仇恨咬紧了牙关。然后：

‘One—two—three!’ Abe counted in a strained voice.
“一——二——三！”亚伯用紧张的声音数着。

They fired at the same moment. McKisco swayed but recovered himself. Both shots had missed.
他们同时开枪。麦基斯科摇晃了一下，但很快又恢复了过来。两次射击均未命中。

‘Now, that’s enough!’ cried Abe.
“现在，够了！”阿贝喊道。

The duellists walked in, and everyone looked at Barban inquiringly.
决斗者们走了进来，所有人都用询问的目光看着巴尔班。

‘I declare myself unsatisfied.’
“我声明自己不满意。”

‘What? Sure you’re satisfied,’ said Abe impatiently. ‘You just don’t know it.’
'什么？当然你满意了，”阿贝不耐烦地说。 “你只是不知道而已。”

‘Your man refuses another shot?’
“你的男人拒绝再开一枪？”

‘You’re damn right, Tommy. You insisted on this and my client went through with it.’
“你说得对，汤米。你坚持这样做，我的客户就这么做了。”

Tommy laughed scornfully.
汤米轻蔑地笑了。

‘The distance was ridiculous,’ he said. ‘I’m not accustomed to such farces—your man must remember he’s not now in America.’
“这个距离太荒谬了，”他说。 “我不习惯这样的闹剧——你的人必须记住他现在不在美国。”

‘No use cracking at America,’ said Abe rather sharply. And then, in a more conciliatory tone, ‘This has gone far enough, Tommy.’ They parleyed briskly for a moment—then Barban nodded and bowed coldly to his late antagonist.
“攻击美国是没有用的，”安倍相当尖锐地说。然后，用一种更加和解的语气说：“汤米，这已经够了。”他们轻快地交谈了一会儿——然后巴班点点头，向他已故的对手冷冷地鞠了一躬。

‘No shake hand?’ suggested the French doctor.
“不握手吗？”法国医生建议道。

‘They already know each other,’ said Abe.
“他们已经认识了，”安倍说。

He turned to McKisco.
他转向麦基斯科。

‘Come on, let’s get out.’
“走吧，我们出去吧。”

As they strode off, McKisco, in exultation, gripped his arm.
当他们大步走开时，麦基斯科欣喜若狂地抓住了他的手臂。

‘Wait a minute!’ Abe said. ‘Tommy wants his pistol back. He might need it again.’
“等一下！”阿贝说。 “汤米想要回他的手枪。他可能会再次需要它。

McKisco handed it over.
麦基斯科把它递了过来。

‘To hell with him,’ he said in a tough voice. ‘Tell him he can—‘
“让他见鬼去吧，”他用强硬的声音说道。 “告诉他他可以——”

‘Shall I tell him you want another shot?’
“我要告诉他你还想再打一针吗？”

‘Well, I did it,’ cried McKisco, as they went along. ‘And I did it pretty well, didn’t I? I wasn’t yellow.’
“好吧，我做到了，”他们一起走时，麦基斯科喊道。 ‘而且我做得很好，不是吗？我不是黄种人。

‘You were pretty drunk,’ said Abe bluntly.
“你喝醉了。”阿贝直言不讳地说。

‘No, I wasn’t.’
“不，我没有。”

‘All right, then, you weren’t.’
“好吧，那么，你不是。”

‘Why would it make any difference if I had a drink or so?’
“为什么我喝了一杯酒会有什么不同呢？”

As his confidence mounted he looked resentfully at Abe.
随着他的信心增强，他怨恨地看着阿贝。

‘What difference does that make?’ he repeated.
“这有什么区别呢？”他重复道。

‘If you can’t see it, there’s no use going into it.’
“如果你看不到它，那么研究就没用了。”

‘Don’t you know everybody was drunk all the time during the war?’
“你不知道战争期间每个人都喝醉了吗？”

‘Well, let’s forget it.’
“好吧，我们还是算了吧。”

But the episode was not quite over. There were urgent footsteps in the heather behind them and the doctor drew up alongside.
但这一集还没有完全结束。他们身后的石南丛中传来急促的脚步声，医生停在了旁边。

‘Pardon, Messieurs,’ he panted. ‘Voulez-vous regler mes honorairies? Naturellement c’est pour soins médicaux seulement. M. Barban n’a qu’un billet de mille et ne peut pas les régler et l’autre a laissé son porte-monnaie chez lui.’
“请原谅，先生们，”他气喘吁吁地说。 “Voulez-vous regler me honourairies？” Naturellement c'est pour soins médicaux seulement。 M. Barban n’a qu’un billet de mille et ne peut pas les régler et l’autre a laissé son porte-monnaie chez lui。

‘Trust a Frenchman to think of that,’ said Abe, and then to the doctor. ‘Combien?’
“相信法国人会想到这一点，”安倍说，然后对医生说。 “科比恩？”

‘Let me pay this,’ said McKisco.
“让我付这个钱吧，”麦基斯科说。

‘No, I’ve got it. We were all in about the same danger.’
‘不，我已经拿到了。我们都面临着同样的危险。

Abe paid the doctor while McKisco suddenly turned into the bushes and was sick there. Then paler than before he strutted on with Abe toward the car through the now rosy morning.
阿部付了钱给医生，而麦基斯科突然走进灌木丛并在那里生病了。然后他的脸色比之前更苍白了，在这个玫瑰色的早晨，他和阿贝一起大步朝车走去。

Campion lay gasping on his back in the shrubbery, the only casualty of the duel, while Rosemary suddenly hysterical with laughter kept kicking at him with her espadrille. She did this persistently until she roused him—the only matter of importance to her now was that in a few hours she would see the person whom she still referred to in her mind as ‘the Divers’ on the beach.
坎皮恩仰面躺在灌木丛中，气喘吁吁，他是决斗中唯一的受害者，而罗斯玛丽突然歇斯底里地大笑起来，不断用草编鞋踢他。她坚持不懈地这样做，直到叫醒了他——现在对她来说唯一重要的事情是，几个小时后，她会在海滩上见到那个她在脑海中仍称为“潜水员”的人。

十二

They were at Voisins waiting for Nicole, six of them, Rosemary, the Norths, Dick Diver and two young French musicians. They were looking over the other patrons of the restaurant to see if they had repose—Dick said no American men had any repose, except himself, and they were seeking an example to confront him with. Things looked black for them—not a man had come into the restaurant for ten minutes without raising his hand to his face.
他们在瓦桑等待妮可，他们六人，罗斯玛丽，诺斯，迪克·戴弗和两个年轻的法国音乐家。他们正在查看餐厅的其他顾客，看看他们是否休息过——迪克说，除了他自己，没有一个美国男人休息过，他们正在寻找一个例子来对抗他。对他们来说，事情看起来很糟糕——没有一个人走进餐厅十分钟而不把手举到脸上。

‘We ought never to have given up waxed mustaches,’ said Abe. ‘Nevertheless Dick isn’t the ONLY man with repose—‘
“我们永远不应该放弃打蜡的胡子，”阿贝说。 “尽管如此，迪克并不是唯一一个平静的人——”

‘Oh, yes, I am.’
'噢是的我是。'

‘—but he may be the only sober man with repose.’
“——但他可能是唯一一个清醒、平静的人。”

A well-dressed American had come in with two women who swooped and fluttered unselfconsciously around a table. Suddenly, he perceived that he was being watched—whereupon his hand rose spasmodically and arranged a phantom bulge in his necktie. In another unseated party a man endlessly patted his shaven cheek with his palm, and his companion mechanically raised and lowered the stub of a cold cigar. The luckier ones fingered eyeglasses and facial hair, the unequipped stroked blank mouths, or even pulled desperately at the lobes of their ears.
一个衣冠楚楚的美国人带着两个女人进来了，她们不自觉地绕着桌子扑腾扑腾。突然，他察觉到有人在注视着他——于是他的手痉挛地抬起，在领带上捏出了一个幻影般的凸起。在另一个没有座位的聚会中，一名男子不停地用手掌拍打着剃光的脸颊，他的同伴机械地举起和放下一根冷雪茄的烟蒂。幸运的人用手指抚摸眼镜和胡须，没有装备的人抚摸空白的嘴巴​​，甚至拼命地拉扯耳垂。

A well-known general came in, and Abe, counting on the man’s first year at West Point—that year during which no cadet can resign and from which none ever recovers—made a bet with Dick of five dollars.
一位著名的将军进来了，阿部指望着这个人在西点军校的第一年——这一年里，没有学员可以辞职，也没有人能从中恢复过来——他和迪克打了五美元的赌注。

His hands hanging naturally at his sides, the general waited to be seated. Once his arms swung suddenly backward like a jumper’s and Dick said, ‘Ah!’ supposing he had lost control, but the general recovered and they breathed again—the agony was nearly over, the garçon was pulling out his chair ...
将军双手自然地垂在身侧，等待入座。有一次，他的手臂像跳跃者一样突然向后摆动，迪克说，“啊！”以为他失去了控制，但将军恢复了，他们又呼吸了——痛苦即将结束，加尔松正在拉出他的椅子……

With a touch of fury the conqueror shot up his hand and scratched his gray immaculate head.
征服者带着一丝愤怒，举起手，挠了挠他那灰色完美的脑袋。

‘You see,’ said Dick smugly, ‘I’m the only one.’
“你看，”迪克得意地说，“我是唯一的一个。”

Rosemary was quite sure of it and Dick, realizing that he never had a better audience, made the group into so bright a unit that Rosemary felt an impatient disregard for all who were not at their table. They had been two days in Paris but actually they were still under the beach umbrella. When, as at the ball of the Corps des Pages the night before, the surroundings seemed formidable to Rosemary, who had yet to attend a Mayfair party in Hollywood, Dick would bring the scene within range by greeting a few people, a sort of selection—the Divers seemed to have a large acquaintance, but it was always as if the person had not seen them for a long, long time, and was utterly bowled over, ‘Why, where do you KEEP yourselves?’—and then re-create the unity of his own party by destroying the outsiders softly but permanently with an ironic coup de grâce. Presently Rosemary seemed to have known those people herself in some deplorable past, and then got on to them, rejected them, discarded them.
罗斯玛丽对此深信不疑，而迪克也意识到自己从来没有比这更好的听众了，于是他把这群人打造成一个如此明亮的整体，以至于罗斯玛丽对所有不在场的人感到一种不耐烦的漠视。他们在巴黎待了两天，但实际上他们还在遮阳伞下。就像前一天晚上在军团舞会上一样，当罗斯玛丽（她还没有参加好莱坞的梅菲尔派对）周围的环境似乎令人生畏时，迪克会通过向几个人打招呼来将场景纳入范围之内，这是一种选择——戴弗夫妇似乎很熟，但那人似乎已经很久很久没有见到他们了，完全被迷住了，“为什么，你们把自己藏在哪里？”——然后又——通过讽刺性的致命一击，温和但永久地摧毁外来者，从而建立自己政党的团结。此刻，罗斯玛丽似乎在一些可悲的过去认识了这些人，然后接近他们，拒绝他们，抛弃他们。

Their own party was overwhelmingly American and sometimes scarcely American at all. It was themselves he gave back to them, blurred by the compromises of how many years.
他们自己的政党绝大多数是美国人，有时甚至根本不是美国人。他回馈给他们的是他们自己，多年来的妥协让他们变得模糊。

Into the dark, smoky restaurant, smelling of the rich raw foods on the buffet, slid Nicole’s sky-blue suit like a stray segment of the weather outside. Seeing from their eyes how beautiful she was, she thanked them with a smile of radiant appreciation. They were all very nice people for a while, very courteous and all that. Then they grew tired of it and they were funny and bitter, and finally they made a lot of plans. They laughed at things that they would not remember clearly afterward—laughed a lot and the men drank three bottles of wine. The trio of women at the table were representative of the enormous flux of American life. Nicole was the granddaughter of a self-made American capitalist and the granddaughter of a Count of the House of Lippe Weissenfeld. Mary North was the daughter of a journeyman paper-hanger and a descendant of President Tyler. Rosemary was from the middle of the middle class, catapulted by her mother onto the uncharted heights of Hollywood. Their point of resemblance to each other and their difference from so many American women, lay in the fact that they were all happy to exist in a man’s world—they preserved their individuality through men and not by opposition to them. They would all three have made alternatively good courtesans or good wives not by the accident of birth but through the greater accident of finding their man or not finding him.
走进昏暗、烟雾缭绕的餐厅，闻着自助餐上浓郁的生食味道，妮可穿上天蓝色的西装，就像外面天气的一段飘散的片段。从他们的眼神中看出她是多么美丽，她带着灿烂的微笑向他们道谢。有一段时间他们都是非常好的人，非常有礼貌等等。然后他们厌倦了，又好笑又苦涩，最后他们制定了很多计划。他们笑了一些后来记不太清的事情——笑了很多，男人们喝了三瓶酒。餐桌上的三位女性代表了美国生活的巨大变化。妮可是白手起家的美国资本家的孙女，也是利普·魏森菲尔德家族伯爵的孙女。玛丽·诺斯是一名熟练裱纸工的女儿，也是泰勒总统的后裔。罗斯玛丽出身于中产阶级，在母亲的推动下，她登上了好莱坞未知的高度。她们彼此的相似之处和与众多美国女性的不同之处在于，她们都乐于生活在男人的世界里——她们通过男人而不是通过反对男人来保持自己的个性。她们三人都可能成为好妓女或好妻子，不是因为出生的偶然，而是因为找到自己的男人或找不到他的更大的偶然。

So Rosemary found it a pleasant party, that luncheon, nicer in that there were only seven people, about the limit of a good party. Perhaps, too, the fact that she was new to their world acted as a sort of catalytic agent to precipitate out all their old reservations about one another. After the table broke up, a waiter directed Rosemary back into the dark hinterland of all French restaurants, where she looked up a phone number by a dim orange bulb, and called Franco-American Films. Sure, they had a print of ‘Daddy’s Girl’—it was out for the moment, but they would run it off later in the week for her at 341 Rue des Saintes Anges—ask for Mr. Crowder.
所以罗斯玛丽觉得这是一次愉快的聚会，那次午餐会更美好，因为只有七个人，大约是一次好聚会的极限。也许，她对他们的世界来说是个新手，这一事实也充当了一种催化剂，促使他们消除了对彼此的所有旧有保留。桌子散开后，一名服务员引导罗斯玛丽回到所有法国餐馆的黑暗腹地，在那里她通过昏暗的橙色灯泡查找了电话号码，并给法美电影公司打电话。当然，他们有一张《爸爸的女孩》的印刷品——目前已经出版，但他们会在本周晚些时候在圣天使街 341 号为她发行——请找克劳德先生。

The semi-booth gave on the vestiaire and as Rosemary hung up the receiver she heard two low voices not five feet from her on the other side of a row of coats.
半隔间给了门厅，当罗斯玛丽挂上听筒时，她听到距离她不到五英尺的一排外套的另一边有两个低沉的声音。

‘—So you love me?’
'-就是说你爱我了？'

‘Oh, DO I!’
“哦，我愿意！”

It Was Nicole—Rosemary hesitated in the door of the booth—then she heard Dick say:
是妮可——罗斯玛丽在电话亭门口犹豫了一下——然后她听到迪克说：

‘I want you terribly—let’s go to the hotel now.’ Nicole gave a little gasping sigh. For a moment the words conveyed nothing at all to Rosemary—but the tone did. The vast secretiveness of it vibrated to herself.
“我非常想要你——我们现在就去旅馆吧。”妮可轻轻地叹了口气。有一瞬间，这些话对罗斯玛丽来说毫无意义——但语气却传达了意义。它的巨大秘密让她自己感到震动。

‘I want you.’
'我要你。'

‘I’ll be at the hotel at four.’
“我四点钟到酒店。”

Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away. She was at first even astonished—she had seen them in their relation to each other as people without personal exigencies—as something cooler. Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her, profound and unidentified. She did not know whether she was attracted or repelled, but only that she was deeply moved. It made her feel very alone as she went back into the restaurant, but it was touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude of Nicole’s ‘Oh, DO I!’ echoed in her mind. The particular mood of the passage she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was from it her stomach told her it was all right—she had none of the aversion she had felt in the playing of certain love scenes in pictures.
当声音渐渐远去时，罗斯玛丽气喘吁吁地站着。起初她甚至感到惊讶——她认为他们之间的关系是没有个人迫切需要的人——是一种更酷的东西。现在，一股强烈的情感流过她的全身，深刻而难以辨认。她不知道自己是被吸引，还是被排斥，只知道被深深地感动了。当她回到餐厅时，这让她感到非常孤独，但看着很感动，妮可的“哦，我愿意！”的热情感激在她脑海中回响。她所目睹的那一段的特殊气氛就在她眼前。但无论距离有多远，她的胃告诉她没关系——她没有在电影中播放某些爱情场景时感到的厌恶。

Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated in it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much more conscious of the assignation than Nicole herself. She looked at Nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions. Certainly she was the most attractive woman Rosemary had ever met—with her hardness, her devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness, which Rosemary, thinking now through her mother’s middle-class mind, associated with her attitude about money. Rosemary spent money she had earned—she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in the pool six times that January day with her temperature roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when her mother stopped it.
虽然远离它，但她现在却无可挽回地参与其中，和妮可一起购物时，她比妮可本人更清楚这一任务。她以一种新的方式看待妮可，估量着她的吸引力。当然，她是罗斯玛丽见过的最有魅力的女人——她的坚强、她的奉献和忠诚，以及某种难以捉摸的东西，罗斯玛丽现在通过她母亲的中产阶级思想，将这些与她对金钱的态度联系在一起。罗斯玛丽花掉了她赚来的钱——她之所以来到欧洲，是因为那一月的一天，她已经去游泳池六次了，她的体温从清晨的 99° 上升到了 103°，后来她妈妈阻止了。

With Nicole’s help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the windows besides. Everything she liked that she couldn’t possibly use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought colored beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds, miniatures for a doll’s house and three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns. She bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from Hermes— bought all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan buying underwear and jewels, which were after all professional equipment and insurance—but with an entirely different point of view. Nicole was the product of much ingenuity and toil. For her sake trains began their run at Chicago and traversed the round belly of the continent to California; chicle factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories; men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of copper hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August or worked rudely at the Five-and-Tens on Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians toiled on Brazilian coffee plantations and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new tractors—these were some of the people who gave a tithe to Nicole, and as the whole system swayed and thundered onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes of hers as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman’s face holding his post before a spreading blaze. She illustrated very simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.
在妮可的帮助下，罗斯玛丽用她的钱买了两件衣服、两顶帽子和四双鞋。妮可从一份长达两页的清单中购买了商品，此外还买了橱窗里的东西。所有她喜欢但自己无法使用的东西，她都买来作为礼物送给朋友。她买了彩色珠子、折叠沙滩垫、人造花、蜂蜜、一张客床、袋子、围巾、爱情鸟、娃娃屋的模型和三码长的虾颜色的新布料。她买了十几套泳衣，一条橡胶鳄鱼皮，一套黄金和象牙色的旅行国际象棋，给安倍买了大亚麻手帕，从爱马仕买了两件翠鸟蓝和燃烧灌木色的麂皮夹克——买了所有这些东西，一点也不像高级的……阶级名妓购买内衣和珠宝，毕竟是专业装备和保险——但观点却完全不同。妮可是许多聪明才智和辛劳的产物。为了她，火车从芝加哥开始运行，穿过大陆的圆腹到达加利福尼亚州。糖胶树胶工厂陷入困境，工厂里的链接带逐一链接增长；人们在大桶中混合牙膏，并从铜桶中取出漱口水。女孩们在八月迅速把西红柿装罐头，或者在圣诞节前夕在五加十粗鲁地工作；混血印第安人在巴西咖啡种植园辛勤劳作，梦想家被剥夺了新型拖拉机的专利权——这些人向妮可缴纳了什一税，随着整个系统的摇曳和轰鸣，它给这些人带来了狂热的绽放。她的批发采购流程就像一名消防员在蔓延的大火前坚守岗位时脸红的样子。 她阐释了非常简单的原则，其中包含了她自己的厄运，但又如此准确地阐释了它们，以至于程序中充满了优雅，不久罗斯玛丽就会尝试模仿它。

It was almost four. Nicole stood in a shop with a love bird on her shoulder, and had one of her infrequent outbursts of speech.
已经快四点了。妮可肩上扛着一只爱情鸟，站在一家商店里，发表了她罕见的讲话。

‘Well, what if you hadn’t gone in that pool that day—I sometimes wonder about such things. Just before the war we were in Berlin—I was thirteen, it was just before Mother died. My sister was going to a court ball and she had three of the royal princes on her dance card, all arranged by a chamberlain and everything. Half an hour before she was going to start she had a side ache and a high fever. The doctor said it was appendicitis and she ought to be operated on. But Mother had her plans made, so Baby went to the ball and danced till two with an ice pack strapped on under her evening dress. She was operated on at seven o’clock next morning.’
“好吧，如果那天你没有去那个游泳池怎么办——我有时会想这些事情。战争爆发前，我们在柏林——我十三岁，母亲去世前不久。我姐姐要去参加一场宫廷舞会，她的舞会卡上写着三位皇家王子，所有这些都是由一位管家安排的。出发前半小时，她感到侧痛并发高烧。医生说是阑尾炎，需要手术。但妈妈已经做好了计划，于是宝贝就去参加舞会，在晚礼服下绑着冰袋，一直跳舞到两点。她于第二天早上七点接受了手术。

It was good to be hard, then; all nice people were hard on themselves. But it was four o’clock and Rosemary kept thinking of Dick waiting for Nicole now at the hotel. She must go there, she must not make him wait for her. She kept thinking, ‘Why don’t you go?’ and then suddenly, ‘Or let me go if you don’t want to.’ But Nicole went to one more place to buy corsages for them both and sent one to Mary North. Only then she seemed to remember and with sudden abstraction she signalled for a taxi.
那么，努力一点是件好事。所有善良的人都对自己很严厉。但现在已经四点了，罗斯玛丽一直想着迪克正在酒店等妮可。她必须要去那里，她不能让他等她。她一直在想，“你为什么不走？”然后突然，“如果你不想的话，就让我走吧。”但是妮可又去了一个地方给他们俩买了胸花，并寄了一颗给玛丽·诺斯。 。直到这时她似乎才想起来，突然心不在焉地示意叫一辆出租车。

‘Good-by,’ said Nicole. ‘We had fun, didn’t we?’
“再见，”妮可说。 “我们玩得很开心，不是吗？”

‘Loads of fun,’ said Rosemary. It was more difficult than she thought and her whole self protested as Nicole drove away.
“很有趣，”罗斯玛丽说。这比她想象的要困难，当妮可开车离开时，她整个人都在抗议。

Dick turned the corner of the traverse and continued along the trench walking on the duckboard. He came to a periscope, looked through it a moment; then he got up on the step and peered over the parapet. In front of him beneath a dingy sky was Beaumont Hamel; to his left the tragic hill of Thiepval. Dick stared at them through his field glasses, his throat straining with sadness.
迪克转过横道的拐角，继续在鸭板上沿着战壕行走。他来到一个潜望镜前，看了一会儿；然后他站上台阶，越过栏杆往外看。在他面前，在昏暗的天空下，是博蒙特·哈梅尔。在他的左边是悲惨的蒂普瓦尔山。迪克透过望远镜盯着他们，他的喉咙因悲伤而绷紧。

He went on along the trench, and found the others waiting for him in the next traverse. He was full of excitement and he wanted to communicate it to them, to make them understand about this, though actually Abe North had seen battle service and he had not.
他沿着战壕继续前行，发现其他人在下一条通道里等着他。他充满了兴奋，他想向他们传达这一点，让他们了解这一点，尽管实际上阿贝·诺斯曾参加过战斗，而他没有。

‘This land here cost twenty lives a foot that summer,’ he said to Rosemary. She looked out obediently at the rather bare green plain with its low trees of six years’ growth. If Dick had added that they were now being shelled she would have believed him that afternoon. Her love had reached a point where now at last she was beginning to be unhappy, to be desperate. She didn’t know what to do—she wanted to talk to her mother.
“那年夏天，这片土地每英尺损失了二十条人命，”他对罗斯玛丽说。她顺从地望着窗外那片光秃秃的绿色平原，上面长满了生长了六年的低矮树木。如果迪克补充说他们现在正在遭到炮击，她那天下午就会相信他。她的爱已经达到了一个地步，现在她终于开始不快乐，开始绝望。她不知道该怎么办——她想和妈妈谈谈。

‘There are lots of people dead since and we’ll all be dead soon,’ said Abe consolingly.
“从那时起，已经有很多人死了，我们很快就会死去，”安倍安慰道。

Rosemary waited tensely for Dick to continue.
罗斯玛丽紧张地等待迪克继续说下去。

‘See that little stream—we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it—a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do that again in this generation.’
“看看那条小溪——我们两分钟内就能走到那里。英国人花了一个月的时间才走到那儿——整个帝国走得很慢，前面死了，后面又向前推进。另一个帝国则每天缓慢地倒退几英寸，留下的死者就像一百万张血淋淋的地毯。这一代欧洲人不会再这样做了。”

‘Why, they’ve only just quit over in Turkey,’ said Abe. ‘And in Morocco—‘
“为什么，他们刚刚在土耳其退出，”安倍说。 “而在摩洛哥——”

‘That’s different. This western-front business couldn’t be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldn’t. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren’t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiancée, and little cafés in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather’s whiskers.’
'那不一样。这种西线的生意不可能再做了，而且很长一段时间都不会。年轻人认为他们能做到，但他们做不到。他们可以再次与第一个马恩河作战，但这次不行。这需要宗教信仰、多年的充足和巨大的保证以及阶级之间存在的确切关系。俄罗斯人和意大利人在这方面表现不佳。你必须有一个全心全意的情感装备，可以追溯到你记忆中更久远的地方。你必须记住圣诞节，王储和他的未婚妻的明信片，瓦朗斯的小咖啡馆，菩提树下大街的啤酒花园，市政厅的婚礼，去德比，还有你祖父的胡须。

‘General Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixtyfive.’
“格兰特将军于六十五岁时在彼得堡发明了这种战斗。”

‘No, he didn’t—he just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in Marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes of Wurtemburg and Westphalia. Why, this was a love battle—there was a century of middle-class love spent here. This was the last love battle.’
“不，他没有——他只是发明了大规模屠杀。这种战斗是刘易斯·卡罗尔和儒勒·凡尔纳以及《温蒂娜》的作者、马赛的乡村执事保龄球和马雷恩以及符腾堡和威斯特伐利亚后巷的女孩们发明的。哎呀，这是一场爱情之战——一个世纪的中产阶级爱情在这里度过。这是最后一场爱情之战。

‘You want to hand over this battle to D. H. Lawrence,’ said Abe.
“你想把这场战斗交给D.H.劳伦斯，”阿部说。

‘All my beautiful lovely safe world blew itself up here with a great gust of high explosive love,’ Dick mourned persistently. ‘Isn’t that true, Rosemary?’
“我所有美丽可爱的安全世界都被一股高度爆炸性的爱的狂风炸毁了，”迪克持续地哀悼着。 “这不是真的吗，罗斯玛丽？”

‘I don’t know,’ she answered with a grave face. ‘You know everything.’
“我不知道，”她表情严肃地回答。 “你什么都知道。”

They dropped behind the others. Suddenly a shower of earth gobs and pebbles came down on them and Abe yelled from the next traverse:
他们落后于其他人。突然，一阵土块和鹅卵石落在他们身上，亚伯在下一条横道上喊道：

‘The war spirit’s getting into me again. I have a hundred years of Ohio love behind me and I’m going to bomb out this trench.’ His head popped up over the embankment. ‘You’re dead—don’t you know the rules? That was a grenade.’
‘战争精神再次进入我的体内。我对俄亥俄州有一百年的热爱，我要炸掉这条壕沟。”他的头从路堤上伸出来。 ‘你死定了——你不知道规矩吗？那是一枚手榴弹。

Rosemary laughed and Dick picked up a retaliatory handful of stones and then put them down.
罗斯玛丽大笑起来，迪克报复性地拿起一把石头，然后又放下了。

‘I couldn’t kid here,’ he said rather apologetically. ‘The silver cord is cut and the golden bowl is broken and all that, but an old romantic like me can’t do anything about it.’
“我不能在这里开玩笑，”他颇为抱歉地说。 “银绳断了，金碗断了等等，但像我这样的老浪漫主义者却无能为力。”

‘I’m romantic too.’
“我也很浪漫。”

They came out of the neat restored trench, and faced a memorial to the Newfoundland dead. Reading the inscription Rosemary burst into sudden tears. Like most women she liked to be told how she should feel, and she liked Dick’s telling her which things were ludicrous and which things were sad. But most of all she wanted him to know how she loved him, now that the fact was upsetting everything, now that she was walking over the battlefield in a thrilling dream.
他们走出整齐修复的战壕，面前是一座纽芬兰阵亡者纪念碑。读着碑文，罗斯玛丽突然泪流满面。像大多数女人一样，她喜欢别人告诉她应该如何感受，她喜欢迪克告诉她哪些事情是可笑的，哪些事情是悲伤的。但最重要的是，她想让他知道她是多么爱他，既然事实让一切都变得令人不安，既然她在惊心动魄的梦中走过战场。

After that they got in their car and started back toward Amiens. A thin warm rain was falling on the new scrubby woods and underbrush and they passed great funeral pyres of sorted duds, shells, bombs, grenades, and equipment, helmets, bayonets, gun stocks and rotten leather, abandoned six years in the ground. And suddenly around a bend the white caps of a great sea of graves. Dick asked the chauffeur to stop.
之后，他们上了车，开始返回亚眠。一场薄薄的温暖雨落在新的灌木丛和灌木丛上，他们经过了巨大的火葬柴堆，里面堆满了分类的哑弹、炮弹、炸弹、手榴弹和装备、头盔、刺刀、枪托和腐烂的皮革，这些东西被遗弃在地下六年了。突然，在一个弯道周围，出现了一片白色的坟墓海洋。迪克要求司机停车。

‘There’s that girl—and she still has her wreath.’
“就是那个女孩——她还保留着她的花环。”

They watched as he got out and went over to the girl, who stood uncertainly by the gate with a wreath in her hand. Her taxi waited. She was a red-haired girl from Tennessee whom they had met on the train this morning, come from Knoxville to lay a memorial on her brother’s grave. There were tears of vexation on her face.
他们看着他下车，走到女孩身边，女孩手里拿着花圈，犹豫不决地站在门口。她的出租车正在等待。她是一个来自田纳西州的红发女孩，他们今天早上在火车上认识的，她从诺克斯维尔来到她哥哥的坟墓上悼念。她的脸上挂满了懊恼的泪水。

‘The War Department must have given me the wrong number,’ she whimpered. ‘It had another name on it. I been lookin’ for it since two o’clock, and there’s so many graves.’
“陆军部肯定给了我错误的号码，”她呜咽道。 ‘上面有另一个名字。我从两点开始就一直在找它，那里有很多坟墓。”

‘Then if I were you I’d just lay it on any grave without looking at the name,’ Dick advised her.
“那么，如果我是你，我就会把它放在任何坟墓上，而不看名字，”迪克建议她。

‘You reckon that’s what I ought to do?’
“你认为这是我应该做的吗？”

‘I think that’s what he’d have wanted you to do.’
“我想这就是他希望你做的事。”

It was growing dark and the rain was coming down harder.
天渐渐黑了，雨下得更大了。

She left the wreath on the first grave inside the gate, and accepted Dick’s suggestion that she dismiss her taxi-cab and ride back to Amiens with them.
她把花圈留在了大门内的第一个坟墓上，并接受了迪克的建议，让她下车，和他们一起骑车返回亚眠。

Rosemary shed tears again when she heard of the mishap—altogether it had been a watery day, but she felt that she had learned something, though exactly what it was she did not know. Later she remembered all the hours of the afternoon as happy—one of those uneventful times that seem at the moment only a link between past and future pleasure but turn out to have been the pleasure itself.
当罗斯玛丽听说这件事时，她再次流下了眼泪——总的来说，这是一个水汪汪的一天，但她觉得自己学到了一些东西，尽管具体是什么她不知道。后来，她记得下午的所有时间都是快乐的——那些平静的时光，此刻似乎只是过去和未来快乐之间的联系，但事实证明，这就是快乐本身。

Amiens was an echoing purple town, still sad with the war, as some railroad stations were:—the Gare du Nord and Waterloo station in London. In the daytime one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great gray cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs. But after dark all that is most satisfactory in French life swims back into the picture—the sprightly tarts, the men arguing with a hundred Voilàs in the cafés, the couples drifting, head to head, toward the satisfactory inexpensiveness of nowhere. Waiting for the train they sat in a big arcade, tall enough to release the smoke and chatter and music upward and obligingly the orchestra launched into ‘Yes, We Have No Bananas,’—they clapped, because the leader looked so pleased with himself. The Tennessee girl forgot her sorrow and enjoyed herself, even began flirtations of tropical eye-rollings and pawings, with Dick and Abe. They teased her gently.
亚眠是一座紫色的小镇，仍然因战争而悲伤，就像一些火车站一样：伦敦北站和滑铁卢车站。白天，人们对这样的城镇感到泄气，二十年前的小电车穿过大教堂前灰色鹅卵石铺成的大广场，天气似乎具有过去的品质，褪色的天气老照片。但天黑后，法国生活中最令人满意的一切又浮现在画面中——活泼的馅饼、男人们在咖啡馆里与一百个“Voilàs”争论、情侣们头对头地漂流，走向令人满意的廉价的地方。等火车时，他们坐在一个大拱廊里，拱廊足够高，可以向上释放烟雾、喋喋不休的声音和音乐，管弦乐队乐于助人地开始演奏“是的，我们没有香蕉”——他们鼓掌，因为领导者看起来对自己很满意。这位田纳西州的女孩忘记了悲伤，享受着自己的生活，甚至开始与迪克和亚伯进行热带风情的翻白眼和爪子调情。他们温柔地取笑她。

Then, leaving infinitesimal sections of Wurtemburgers, Prussian Guards, Chasseurs Alpins, Manchester mill hands and old Etonians to pursue their eternal dissolution under the warm rain, they took the train for Paris. They ate sandwiches of mortadel sausage and bel paese cheese made up in the station restaurant, and drank Beaujolais. Nicole was abstracted, biting her lip restlessly and reading over the guide-books to the battle-field that Dick had brought along—indeed, he had made a quick study of the whole affair, simplifying it always until it bore a faint resemblance to one of his own parties.
然后，留下符腾堡人、普鲁士卫队、阿尔卑斯猎兵、曼彻斯特磨坊工人和老伊顿公学的极小部分人在温暖的雨中追求他们的永恒消散，他们乘火车前往巴黎。他们吃了车站餐厅做的由摩塔德尔香肠和贝尔帕斯奶酪组成的三明治，喝了博若莱葡萄酒。妮可心不在焉，焦躁地咬着嘴唇，翻阅着迪克带来的战场指南——事实上，他对整个事情进行了快速研究，总是将其简化，直到它与一个人有一丝相似之处。他自己的政党。

十四

When they reached Paris Nicole was too tired to go on to the grand illumination at the Decorative Art Exposition as they had planned. They left her at the Hotel Roi George, and as she disappeared between the intersecting planes made by lobby lights of the glass doors, Rosemary’s oppression lifted. Nicole was a force—not necessarily well disposed or predictable like her mother—an incalculable force. Rosemary was somewhat afraid of her.
当他们到达巴黎时，妮可太累了，无法按照计划继续观看装饰艺术博览会上的盛大灯光秀。他们把她留在乔治王酒店，当她消失在玻璃门大厅灯光所形成的交叉平面之间时，罗斯玛丽的压抑感消失了。妮可是一股力量——不一定像她母亲那样善解人意或可预测——一股不可估量的力量。罗斯玛丽有些怕她。

At eleven she sat with Dick and the Norths at a houseboat café just opened on the Seine. The river shimmered with lights from the bridges and cradled many cold moons. On Sundays sometimes when Rosemary and her mother had lived in Paris they had taken the little steamer up to Suresnes and talked about plans for the future. They had little money but Mrs. Speers was so sure of Rosemary’s beauty and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was willing to gamble the money on ‘advantages”; Rosemary in turn was to repay her mother when she got her start... .
十一点，她与迪克和诺斯一家坐在塞纳河上一家新开张的船屋咖啡馆里。河面上闪烁着桥上的灯光，摇曳着许多寒冷的月亮。有时，罗斯玛丽和她母亲住在巴黎时，每周日都会乘小轮船前往苏雷讷，谈论未来的计划。他们没什么钱，但斯皮尔斯夫人对罗斯玛丽的美貌深信不疑，并给她注入了如此大的野心，以至于她愿意把钱赌在“优势”上；罗斯玛丽开始创业后，也将报答她的母亲……

Since reaching Paris Abe North had had a thin vinous fur over him; his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine. Rosemary realized for the first time that he was always stopping in places to get a drink, and she wondered how Mary North liked it. Mary was quiet, so quiet save for her frequent laughter that Rosemary had learned little about her. She liked the straight dark hair brushed back until it met some sort of natural cascade that took care of it— from time to time it eased with a jaunty slant over the corner of her temple, until it was almost in her eye when she tossed her head and caused it to fall sleek into place once more.
自从到达巴黎之后，阿贝·诺斯身上就披上了一层薄薄的葡萄酒色皮毛。他的眼睛因阳光和酒而充血。罗斯玛丽第一次意识到他总是在某些地方停下来喝一杯，她想知道玛丽·诺斯是否喜欢这样。玛丽很安静，除了经常大笑之外，非常安静，以至于罗斯玛丽对她知之甚少。她喜欢把黑色的直发向后梳，直到它遇到某种自然的瀑布来照顾它——时不时地，它会在她的太阳穴一角上轻松地倾斜，直到当她把头发抛起来时，它几乎进入了她的眼睛。头并使其再次光滑到位。

‘We’ll turn in early to-night, Abe, after this drink.’ Mary’s voice was light but it held a little flicker of anxiety. ‘You don’t want to be poured on the boat.’
“喝完这杯酒后，我们今晚就早点睡觉，阿部。”玛丽的声音很轻，但带着一丝焦虑。 “你不想被泼到船上。”

‘It’s pretty late now,’ Dick said. ‘We’d all better go.’
“现在已经很晚了，”迪克说。 “我们最好都走吧。”

The noble dignity of Abe’s face took on a certain stubbornness, and he remarked with determination:
阿部高贵的脸上带着几分倔强，他斩钉截铁地说：

‘Oh, no.’ He paused gravely. ‘Oh, no, not yet. We’ll have another bottle of champagne.’
“哦，不。”他严肃地停了下来。 ‘哦，不，还没有。我们还要再来一瓶香槟。

‘No more for me,’ said Dick.
“我不再需要了，”迪克说。

‘It’s Rosemary I’m thinking of. She’s a natural alcoholic—keeps a bottle of gin in the bathroom and all that—her mother told me.’
“我想到的是迷迭香。她是个天生的酒鬼——在浴室里放了一瓶杜松子酒之类的——她母亲告诉我的。

He emptied what was left of the first bottle into Rosemary’s glass. She had made herself quite sick the first day in Paris with quarts of lemonade; after that she had taken nothing with them but now she raised the champagne and drank at it.
他把第一瓶剩下的酒倒进罗斯玛丽的杯子里。到巴黎的第一天，她喝了几夸脱柠檬水，就病得很厉害。从那以后，她什么也没带，但现在她举起香槟，一饮而尽。

‘But what’s this?’ exclaimed Dick. ‘You told me you didn’t drink.’
“但这是什么？”迪克惊呼道。 “你告诉我你不喝酒的。”

‘I didn’t say I was never going to.’
“我没说我永远不会去。”

‘What about your mother?’
“那你妈妈呢？”

‘I’m just going to drink this one glass.’ She felt some necessity for it. Dick drank, not too much, but he drank, and perhaps it would bring her closer to him, be a part of the equipment for what she had to do. She drank it quickly, choked and then said, ‘Besides, yesterday was my birthday—I was eighteen.’
“我就喝这一杯。”她觉得有必要。迪克喝了酒，虽然喝得不多，但他喝了，也许这会让她和他更亲近，成为她必须做的事情的一部分。她很快喝了下去，被噎住了，然后说道：“而且，昨天是我的生日——我十八岁了。”

‘Why didn’t you tell us?’ they said indignantly.
“你为什么不告诉我们？”他们愤怒地说。

‘I knew you’d make a fuss over it and go to a lot of trouble.’ She finished the champagne. ‘So this is the celebration.’
“我知道你会为此大惊小怪，惹出很多麻烦。”她喝完了香槟。 “所以这就是庆祝活动。”

‘It most certainly is not,’ Dick assured her. ‘The dinner tomorrow night is your birthday party and don’t forget it. Eighteen—why that’s a terribly important age.’
“绝对不是，”迪克向她保证。 “明天晚上的晚餐是你的生日聚会，别忘了。十八岁——为什么这是一个非常重要的年龄。

‘I used to think until you’re eighteen nothing matters,’ said Mary.
“我曾经认为，十八岁之前一切都不重要，”玛丽说。

‘That’s right,’ Abe agreed. ‘And afterward it’s the same way.’
“没错，”阿贝同意道。 “之后也是这样。”

‘Abe feels that nothing matters till he gets on the boat,’ said Mary. ‘This time he really has got everything planned out when he gets to New York.’ She spoke as though she were tired of saying things that no longer had a meaning for her, as if in reality the course that she and her husband followed, or failed to follow, had become merely an intention.
“阿贝觉得在他上船之前一切都不重要，”玛丽说。 “这一次，他到了纽约后，真的把一切都计划好了。”她说话的语气似乎已经厌倦了说那些对她来说不再有意义的话，就好像现实中她和她丈夫所遵循的路线一样，或未能遵循，已成为仅仅是一种意图。

‘He’ll be writing music in America and I’ll be working at singing in Munich, so when we get together again there’ll be nothing we can’t do.’
“他将在美国创作音乐，我将在慕尼黑从事歌唱工作，所以当我们再次聚在一起时，我们将无所不能。”

‘That’s wonderful,’ agreed Rosemary, feeling the champagne.
“那太棒了，”罗斯玛丽一边品尝着香槟，一边表示同意。

‘Meanwhile, another touch of champagne for Rosemary. Then she’ll be more able to rationalize the acts of her lymphatic glands. They only begin to function at eighteen.’
“与此同时，又给迷迭香倒了一杯香槟。然后她将能够更合理地合理化她的淋巴腺的行为。他们十八岁时才开始发挥作用。

Dick laughed indulgently at Abe, whom he loved, and in whom he had long lost hope: ‘That’s medically incorrect and we’re going.’ Catching the faint patronage Abe said lightly:
迪克对他深爱的、对他早已失去希望的阿贝纵容地大笑起来：“这在医学上是不正确的，我们要走了。”察觉到阿贝微弱的赞助，他轻声说道：

‘Something tells me I’ll have a new score on Broadway long before you’ve finished your scientific treatise.’
“有件事告诉我，早在你完成你的科学论文之前，我就会在百老汇得到一个新的乐谱。”

‘I hope so,’ said Dick evenly. ‘I hope so. I may even abandon what you call my ‘scientific treatise.’’
“我希望如此，”迪克平静地说。 '但愿如此。我什至可能会放弃你所谓的“科学论文”。

‘Oh, Dick!’ Mary’s voice was startled, was shocked. Rosemary had never before seen Dick’s face utterly expressionless; she felt that this announcement was something momentous and she was inclined to exclaim with Mary ‘Oh, Dick!’
“哦，迪克！”玛丽的声音很惊讶，很震惊。罗斯玛丽以前从未见过迪克毫无表情的脸。她觉得这个宣布意义重大，她想和玛丽一起惊呼“哦，迪克！”

But suddenly Dick laughed again, added to his remark ‘—abandon it for another one,’ and got up from the table.
但突然迪克又笑了，补充了一句“——放弃它，换一个吧”，然后从桌子上站起来。

‘But Dick, sit down. I want to know—‘
“但是迪克，请坐下。”我想知道-'

‘I’ll tell you some time. Good night, Abe. Good night, Mary.’
‘我会告诉你一些时间。晚安，阿部。晚安，玛丽。”

‘Good night, dear Dick.’ Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token... .
“晚安，亲爱的迪克。”玛丽微笑着，仿佛她会非常高兴地坐在这艘几乎荒废的船上。她是一个勇敢、充满希望的女人，她追随丈夫到某个地方，把自己变成这样或那样的人，却无法引导他走出自己的道路，有时会灰心丧气地意识到他内心深处保守的秘密有多么深。她的方向是确定的。然而她身上却弥漫着一种幸运的气息，仿佛她是一种象征……

‘What is it you are giving up?’ demanded Rosemary, facing Dick earnestly in the taxi.
“你要放弃什么？”罗斯玛丽在出租车上认真地面对迪克问道。

‘Nothing of importance.’
“没什么重要的事。”

‘Are you a scientist?’
“你是科学家吗？”

‘I’m a doctor of medicine.’
“我是一名医学博士。”

‘Oh-h!’ she smiled delightedly. ‘My father was a doctor too. Then why don’t you—‘ she stopped.
“噢！”她高兴地笑了。 “我的父亲也是一名医生。那你为什么不——”她停了下来。

‘There’s no mystery. I didn’t disgrace myself at the height of my career, and hide away on the Riviera. I’m just not practising. You can’t tell, I’ll probably practise again some day.’
‘这没有什么神秘的。我没有在职业生涯的巅峰时期让自己丢脸，躲到里维埃拉去。我只是不练习。你看不出来，也许有一天我会再次练习。

Rosemary put up her face quietly to be kissed. He looked at her for a moment as if he didn’t understand. Then holding her in the hollow of his arm he rubbed his cheek against her cheek’s softness, and then looked down at her for another long moment.
罗斯玛丽静静地抬起脸来等待被吻。他看了她一会儿，好像不明白。然后他把她抱在怀里，用自己的脸颊摩擦着她柔软的脸颊，然后又低头看了她很长一段时间。

‘Such a lovely child,’ he said gravely.
“真是个可爱的孩子，”他严肃地说。

She smiled up at him; her hands playing conventionally with the lapels of his coat. ‘I’m in love with you and Nicole. Actually that’s my secret—I can’t even talk about you to anybody because I don’t want any more people to know how wonderful you are. Honestly—I love you and Nicole—I do.’
她抬头对他微笑；她的手按照惯例玩弄着他外套的翻领。 “我爱你和妮可。事实上，这是我的秘密——我什至不能和任何人谈论你，因为我不想让更多的人知道你有多棒。老实说，我爱你和妮可，我愿意。

—So many times he had heard this—even the formula was the same.
——这句话他听过很多次了——连公式都一样。

Suddenly she came toward him, her youth vanishing as she passed inside the focus of his eyes and he had kissed her breathlessly as if she were any age at all. Then she lay back against his arm and sighed.
突然，她朝他走来，当她进入他目光的焦点时，她的青春消失了，他气喘吁吁地吻着她，仿佛她根本就没有年龄。然后她靠在他的手臂上，叹了口气。

‘I’ve decided to give you up,’ she said.
“我已经决定放弃你了，”她说。

Dick started—had he said anything to imply that she possessed any part of him?
迪克吃了一惊——他是否说过任何暗示她占有他的一部分的话？

‘But that’s very mean,’ he managed to say lightly, ‘just when I was getting interested.’
“但这太卑鄙了，”他勉强说道，“正当我开始感兴趣的时候。”

‘I’ve loved you so—‘ As if it had been for years. She was weeping a little now. ‘I’ve loved you so-o-o.’
“我非常爱你——”就好像已经很多年了。她现在有点哭了。 “我非常爱你。”

Then he should have laughed, but he heard himself saying, ‘Not only are you beautiful but you are somehow on the grand scale. Everything you do, like pretending to be in love or pretending to be shy gets across.’
然后他应该笑起来，但他听到自己说：“你不仅美丽，而且不知怎么的，你的规模很大。”你所做的一切，比如假装恋爱或假装害羞，都会被人察觉。

In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume Rosemary had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world. She did not know yet that splendor is something in the heart; at the moment when she realized that and melted into the passion of the universe he could take her without question or regret.
在出租车的黑暗洞穴里，罗斯玛丽带着妮可买的香水的香味，再次靠近，紧紧地贴着他。他吻了她，但并不享受。他知道那里有激情，但她的眼里和嘴上却看不到激情的影子；她的呼吸里带着淡淡的香槟味。她拼命地靠得更近，他再一次吻了她，她的吻纯真无邪，接触的那一刻，他越过他望向夜色的黑暗，世界的黑暗，他的目光让他感到寒冷。她还不知道，辉煌是内心的东西；当她意识到这一点并融入宇宙的激情的那一刻，他可以毫无疑问或遗憾地带走她。

Her room in the hotel was diagonally across from theirs and nearer the elevator. When they reached the door she said suddenly:
她在酒店的房间就在他们的斜对面，靠近电梯。当他们走到门口时，她突然说道：

‘I know you don’t love me—I don’t expect it. But you said I should have told you about my birthday. Well, I did, and now for my birthday present I want you to come into my room a minute while I tell you something. Just one minute.’
“我知道你不爱我——我没想到会这样。但你说我应该告诉你我的生日。嗯，我做到了，现在作为我的生日礼物，我希望你到我的房间来一会儿，我告诉你一些事情。只需一分钟。

They went in and he closed the door, and Rosemary stood close to him, not touching him. The night had drawn the color from her face—she was pale as pale now, she was a white carnation left after a dance.
他们进去后，他关上了门，罗斯玛丽站在他身边，没有碰他。夜色褪去了她脸上的颜色——她的脸色和现在一样苍白，她就像一朵舞后留下的白色康乃馨。

‘When you smile—‘ He had recovered his paternal attitude, perhaps because of Nicole’s silent proximity, ‘I always think I’ll see a gap where you’ve lost some baby teeth.’
“当你微笑时——”他又恢复了父亲般的态度，也许是因为妮可默默地靠近，“我总想我会看到你失去了一些乳牙的缝隙。”

But he was too late—she came close up against him with a forlorn whisper.
但他已经太晚了——她靠在他身边，发出凄凉的低语。

‘Take me.’
'带我去。'

‘Take you where?’
“带你去哪里？”

Astonishment froze him rigid.
惊讶使他浑身僵硬。

‘Go on,’ she whispered. ‘Oh, please go on, whatever they do. I don’t care if I don’t like it—I never expected to—I’ve always hated to think about it but now I don’t. I want you to.’
“继续吧，”她低声说道。 “哦，请继续，不管他们做什么。我不在乎我是否不喜欢它——我从来没想过——我一直不愿意去想它，但现在我不喜欢了。我要你去。'

She was astonished at herself—she had never imagined she could talk like that. She was calling on things she had read, seen, dreamed through a decade of convent hours. Suddenly she knew too that it was one of her greatest rôles and she flung herself into it more passionately.
她对自己感到惊讶——她从来没想过自己能这样说话。她呼唤着她在修道院十年里读过、看到过、梦想过的事物。突然间，她也知道这是她最伟大的角色之一，于是她更加热情地投入其中。

‘This is not as it should be,’ Dick deliberated. ‘Isn’t it just the champagne? Let’s more or less forget it.’
“这不应该是这样，”迪克想道。 “不就是香槟吗？让我们或多或少忘记它吧。

‘Oh, no, NOW. I want you to do it now, take me, show me, I’m absolutely yours and I want to be.’
哦，不，现在。我希望你现在就这么做，带上我，告诉我，我绝对是你的，我也想成为你的。”

‘For one thing, have you thought how much it would hurt Nicole?’
“一方面，你有没有想过这会对妮可造成多大伤害？”

‘She won’t know—this won’t have anything to do with her.’
“她不会知道——这与她没有任何关系。”

He continued kindly.
他继续善意地说道。

‘Then there’s the fact that I love Nicole.’
“事实上，我爱妮可。”

‘But you can love more than just one person, can’t you? Like I love Mother and I love you—more. I love you more now.’
‘但你可以爱不止一个人，不是吗？就像我爱妈妈，我爱你——更爱你。我现在更爱你了。

‘—the fourth place you’re not in love with me but you might be afterwards, and that would begin your life with a terrible mess.’
“——第四，你不爱我，但之后你可能会爱我，那你的生活就会一团糟。”

‘No, I promise I’ll never see you again. I’ll get Mother and go to America right away.’
“不，我保证我再也见不到你了。我马上就去找妈妈去美国。”

He dismissed this. He was remembering too vividly the youth and freshness of her lips. He took another tone.
他驳回了这一点。他对她嘴唇的青春和清新记忆犹新。他换了一种语气。

‘You’re just in that mood.’
“你就是处于那种心情。”

‘Oh, please, I don’t care even if I had a baby. I could go into Mexico like a girl at the studio. Oh, this is so different from anything I ever thought—I used to hate it when they kissed me seriously.’ He saw she was still under the impression that it must happen. ‘Some of them had great big teeth, but you’re all different and beautiful. I want you to do it.’
“哦，拜托，即使我有孩子，我也不在乎。我可以像工作室里的女孩一样去墨西哥。哦，这和我想象的完全不同——我以前很讨厌他们认真地吻我。”他看到她仍然觉得这一定会发生。 “他们中的一些人有很大的牙齿，但你们都是不同的，而且都很美丽。我希望你这么做。

‘I believe you think people just kiss some way and you want me to kiss you.’
“我相信你认为人们只是以某种方式接吻，而你希望我吻你。”

‘Oh, don’t tease me—I’m not a baby. I know you’re not in love with me.’ She was suddenly humble and quiet. ‘I didn’t expect that much. I know I must seem just nothing to you.’
“噢，别取笑我——我又不是小孩子。我知道你不爱我。”她突然变得谦虚和安静。 ‘我没想到那么多。我知道我对你来说一定是无足轻重。

‘Nonsense. But you seem young to me.’ His thoughts added, ‘— there’d be so much to teach you.’
'废话。但对我来说你看起来很年轻。”他的想法补充道，“——有很多东西可以教你。”

Rosemary waited, breathing eagerly till Dick said: ‘And lastly things aren’t arranged so that this could be as you want.’
罗斯玛丽焦急地等待着，直到迪克说：“最后，事情并没有按照你的意愿安排。”

Her face drooped with dismay and disappointment and Dick said automatically, ‘We’ll have to simply—‘ He stopped himself, followed her to the bed, sat down beside her while she wept. He was suddenly confused, not about the ethics of the matter, for the impossibility of it was sheerly indicated from all angles but simply confused, and for a moment his usual grace, the tensile strength of his balance, was absent.
她的脸因沮丧和失望而低垂，迪克下意识地说，“我们必须简单地——”他停下来，跟着她走到床边，在她哭泣时坐在她身边。他突然感到困惑，不是对这件事的伦理问题，因为从各个角度都完全表明了这是不可能的，但他只是感到困惑，有那么一刻，他平常的优雅，他平衡的张力消失了。

‘I knew you wouldn’t,’ she sobbed. ‘It was just a forlorn hope.’
“我就知道你不会，”她抽泣道。 “这只是一个渺茫的希望。”

He stood up.
他站了起来。

‘Good night, child. This is a damn shame. Let’s drop it out of the picture.’ He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to sleep on. ‘So many people are going to love you and it might be nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too. That’s an old-fashioned idea, isn’t it?’ She looked up at him as he took a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his hand fall on the doorknob. Then she gave up and sank back on the bed. When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror, where she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little. One hundred and fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a hundred and fifty more. She brushed it until her arm ached, then she changed arms and went on brushing... .
‘晚安，孩子。这真是一个耻辱。让我们把它从画面中删除吧。”他给了她两句医院里的喋喋不休的话语，让她继续睡觉。 “很多人都会爱你，能够完好无损地遇见你的初恋情人可能会很高兴，在情感上也是如此。”这是一个过时的想法，不是吗？”当他向门口迈出一步时，她抬头看着他。她看着他，完全不知道他脑子里在想什么，她看到他慢动作地又迈出了一步，转身又看着她，她有一瞬间想抓住他，吞噬他，想要他的嘴，他的耳朵，他的衣领，想要包围他，吞没他；她看到他的手落在门把手上。然后她放弃了，跌回床上。门关上后，她起身走到镜子前，开始梳理头发，抽了抽鼻子。罗斯玛丽像往常一样打了一百五十下，然后又打了一百五十下。她刷到手臂酸痛了，才换了一只手臂继续刷……

XVI
十六

She woke up cooled and shamed. The sight of her beauty in the mirror did not reassure her but only awakened the ache of yesterday and a letter, forwarded by her mother, from the boy who had taken her to the Yale prom last fall, which announced his presence in Paris was no help—all that seemed far away. She emerged from her room for the ordeal of meeting the Divers weighted with a double trouble. But it was hidden by a sheath as impermeable as Nicole’s when they met and went together to a series of fittings. It was consoling, though, when Nicole remarked, apropos of a distraught saleswoman: ‘Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do—they think other people’s opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.’ Yesterday in her expansiveness Rosemary would have resented that remark—to-day in her desire to minimize what had happened she welcomed it eagerly. She admired Nicole for her beauty and her wisdom, and also for the first time in her life she was jealous. Just before leaving Gausse’s hotel her mother had said in that casual tone, which Rosemary knew concealed her most significant opinions, that Nicole was a great beauty, with the frank implication that Rosemary was not. This did not bother Rosemary, who had only recently been allowed to learn that she was even personable; so that her prettiness never seemed exactly her own but rather an acquirement, like her French. Nevertheless, in the taxi she looked at Nicole, matching herself against her. There were all the potentialities for romantic love in that lovely body and in the delicate mouth, sometimes tight, sometimes expectantly half open to the world. Nicole had been a beauty as a young girl and she would be a beauty later when her skin stretched tight over her high cheekbones—the essential structure was there. She had been white-Saxon-blonde but she was more beautiful now that her hair had darkened than when it had been like a cloud and more beautiful than she.
她醒来时感到冷漠和羞愧。镜子中的美丽景象并没有让她安心，反而唤醒了昨天的痛苦，她母亲转来了一封信，是去年秋天带她去耶鲁大学舞会的那个男孩写的，信中宣布他在巴黎的存在是不存在的。帮助——这一切似乎都很遥远。她走出自己的房间，迎接与戴弗夫妇会面的磨难，同时也面临着双重麻烦。但当他们见面并一起进行一系列试衣时，它被隐藏在一个像妮可一样不渗透的护套中。不过，当妮可针对一位心烦意乱的女售货员说的话时，这令人感到安慰：“大多数人认为每个人对他们的感觉都比他们实际上更强烈——他们认为别人对他们的看法在赞同或反对之间摇摆不定。”昨天以她的扩张性，罗斯玛丽一定会憎恨这句话——今天，她希望尽量减少所发生的事情，所以她热切地欢迎这句话。她钦佩妮可的美丽和智慧，同时也生平第一次感到嫉妒。就在离开高斯的旅馆之前，她母亲用那种随意的语气说妮可是一位大美人，罗斯玛丽知道这隐藏了她最重要的观点，但坦率地暗示罗斯玛丽不是。这并没有让罗斯玛丽感到困扰，她最近才被允许知道她甚至风度翩翩。因此，她的美丽从来都不是她自己的，而是一种后天习得的，就像她的法语一样。尽管如此，在出租车上她还是看着妮可，将自己与她进行匹配。那可爱的身体和那张时而紧绷，时而满怀期待地半张开的精致的嘴里，蕴含着浪漫爱情的所有潜力。 妮可年轻时就很美，以后当她的皮肤紧绷在高颧骨上时，她也会变得很美——基本结构就在那里。她原本是白色的撒克逊金发女郎，但现在她的头发变黑了，比以前像云一样的时候更漂亮了，比她自己更漂亮了。

‘We lived there,’ Rosemary suddenly pointed to a building in the Rue des Saints-Péres.
“我们住在那里，”罗斯玛丽突然指着圣佩雷斯街上的一栋建筑。

‘That’s strange. Because when I was twelve Mother and Baby and I once spent a winter there,’ and she pointed to a hotel directly across the street. The two dingy fronts stared at them, gray echoes of girlhood.
'真奇怪。因为当我十二岁的时候，妈妈和宝宝曾经在那里度过了一个冬天，”她指着街对面的一家酒店。两条肮脏的脸盯着他们，灰色的少女时代的回声。

‘We’d just built our Lake Forest house and we were economizing,’ Nicole continued. ‘At least Baby and I and the governess economized and Mother travelled.’
“我们刚刚建造了森林湖别墅，我们正在节约开支，”妮可继续说道。 “至少我和宝贝以及家庭女教师节省了开支，而母亲则可以出行。”

‘We were economizing too,’ said Rosemary, realizing that the word meant different things to them.
“我们也在节约，”罗斯玛丽说道，她意识到这个词对他们来说意味着不同的东西。

‘Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel—‘ Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, ‘—I mean instead of saying a ‘cheap’ hotel. If any swanky friends asked us our address we’d never say, ‘We’re in a dingy little hole over in the apache quarter where we’re glad of running water,’—we’d say ‘We’re in a small hotel.’ As if all the big ones were too noisy and vulgar for us. Of course the friends always saw through us and told everyone about it, but Mother always said it showed we knew our way around Europe. She did, of course: she was born a German citizen. But her mother was American, and she was brought up in Chicago, and she was more American than European.’
“妈妈总是非常小心地把它说成是一家小旅馆——”妮可发出磁性的小笑声，“——我的意思是，而不是说是一家‘廉价’旅馆。如果有任何时髦的朋友问我们的地址，我们绝不会说，“我们在阿帕奇区的一个肮脏的小洞里，我们很高兴有自来水，”我们会说“我们在一个小洞里”。好像所有的大酒店对我们来说都太吵闹、太粗俗了。当然，朋友们总是看穿我们并告诉大家这件事，但母亲总是说这表明我们熟悉欧洲的路。当然，她做到了：她出生时就是德国公民。但她的母亲是美国人，她在芝加哥长大，她更像美国人而不是欧洲人。

They were meeting the others in two minutes, and Rosemary reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the taxi in the Rue Guynemer, across from the Luxembourg Gardens. They were lunching in the Norths’ already dismantled apartment high above the green mass of leaves. The day seemed different to Rosemary from the day before—When she saw him face to face their eyes met and brushed like birds’ wings. After that everything was all right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in love with her. She felt wildly happy, felt the warm sap of emotion being pumped through her body. A cool, clear confidence deepened and sang in her. She scarcely looked at Dick but she knew everything was all right.
两分钟后他们就要和其他人见面了，当他们在卢森堡花园对面的盖纳梅尔街下了出租车时，罗斯玛丽再次恢复了自我。他们正在诺斯一家已经拆除的公寓里吃午饭，公寓高高地位于绿叶之上。对罗斯玛丽来说，这一天似乎与前一天不同——当她面对面地看到他时，他们的目光相遇，像鸟儿的翅膀一样掠过。之后一切都好了，一切都美好了，她知道他开始爱上她了。她感到无比的快乐，感受到温暖的情感流过她的身体。一种冷静、清晰的自信在她心中加深并歌唱。她几乎没有看迪克，但她知道一切都好。

After luncheon the Divers and the Norths and Rosemary went to the Franco-American Films, to be joined by Collis Clay, her young man from New Haven, to whom she had telephoned. He was a Georgian, with the peculiarly regular, even stencilled ideas of Southerners who are educated in the North. Last winter she had thought him attractive—once they held hands in an automobile going from New Haven to New York; now he no longer existed for her.
午饭后，戴弗夫妇、诺斯夫妇和罗斯玛丽去了法美电影公司，科利斯·克莱也和她一起去了，科利斯·克莱是她从纽黑文来的年轻人，她曾给他打过电话。他是格鲁吉亚人，有着在北方接受教育的南方人特有的、甚至是刻板化的想法。去年冬天，当他们手牵手坐在一辆从纽黑文开往纽约的汽车里时，她就觉得他很有魅力。现在他对她来说不再存在了。

In the projection room she sat between Collis Clay and Dick while the mechanic mounted the reels of Daddy’s Girl and a French executive fluttered about her trying to talk American slang. ‘Yes, boy,’ he said when there was trouble with the projector, ‘I have not any benenas.’ Then the lights went out, there was the sudden click and a flickering noise and she was alone with Dick at last. They looked at each other in the half darkness.
在放映室里，她坐在科利斯·克莱和迪克之间，机械师正在安装《爸爸的女孩》的卷轴，一位法国高管则喋喋不休地谈论她试图说美国俚语。 “是的，孩子，”当投影仪出现故障时，他说，“我没有任何好处。”然后灯灭了，突然发出咔嗒声和闪烁的噪音，最后她和迪克单独在一起了。他们在半明半暗的夜色中互相看着对方。

‘Dear Rosemary,’ he murmured. Their shoulders touched. Nicole stirred restlessly at the end of the row and Abe coughed convulsively and blew his nose; then they all settled down and the picture ran.
“亲爱的罗斯玛丽，”他低声说道。他们的肩膀碰在一起。妮可在队伍的最后一刻不安地动动，阿贝痉挛地咳嗽，擤鼻涕。然后他们都安静下来，照片开始播放。

There she was—the school girl of a year ago, hair down her back and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a tanagra figure; there she was—SO young and innocent—the product of her mother’s loving care; there she was—embodying all the immaturity of the race, cutting a new cardboard paper doll to pass before its empty harlot’s mind. She remembered how she had felt in that dress, especially fresh and new under the fresh young silk.
她就在那里——一年前的女学生，头发垂到背后，硬邦邦地散开，就像塔纳格拉雕像的实心头发；她就在那里——那么年轻、那么天真——是她母亲关爱的产物；她就在那里——体现了这个种族所有的不成熟，剪了一个新的纸板娃娃，在它空荡荡的妓女的脑海中传递。她记得自己穿着那件衣服的感觉，在新鲜的丝绸下显得格外清新。

Daddy’s girl. Was it a ‘itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer? Ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn’t she dest too tweet? Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable became evitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away. Women would forget the dirty dishes at home and weep, even within the picture one woman wept so long that she almost stole the film away from Rosemary. She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room, in an aviation port, and during a yacht-race that was only used in two flashes, in a subway and finally in a bathroom. But Rosemary triumphed. Her fineness of character, her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity of the world, and Rosemary showing what it took with a face that had not yet become mask-like—yet it was actually so moving that the emotions of the whole row of people went out to her at intervals during the picture. There was a break once and the light went on and after the chatter of applause Dick said to her sincerely: ‘I’m simply astounded. You’re going to be one of the best actresses on the stage.’
爸爸的女儿。它是一个“小勇敢者”吗？它受苦了吗？噢-噢-推特，最推特的东西，她不是也太推特了吗？在她的小拳头面前，欲望和腐败的力量滚滚而去；不，命运的脚步已经停止了；不可避免的变成了不可避免的，三段论，辩证法，所有的理性都消失了。女人们会忘记家里的脏盘子而哭泣，甚至在照片中，一名妇女哭得太久，以至于她几乎从罗斯玛丽那里偷走了胶卷。她在一套价值不菲的布景上哭了，在邓肯·菲夫餐厅、在航空港、在只用了两次闪光的游艇比赛中、在地铁里、最后在浴室里。但罗斯玛丽胜利了。她的善良的品格，她被世俗的粗俗所侵扰的勇气和坚定，还有迷迭香以一张尚未变成面具的脸庞表现出的样子——却是如此的动人，让一排人的情绪都为之动容。拍摄期间，人们时不时地走向她。有一次休息，灯亮了，在热烈的掌声之后，迪克真诚地对她说：“我简直感到惊讶。”你将成为舞台上最好的女演员之一。

Then back to Daddy’s Girl: happier days now, and a lovely shot of Rosemary and her parent united at the last in a father complex so apparent that Dick winced for all psychologists at the vicious sentimentality. The screen vanished, the lights went on, the moment had come.
然后回到《爸爸的女儿》：现在的日子越来越快乐了，最后一张可爱的照片显示罗斯玛丽和她的父母在最后的父亲情结中团结在一起，这种父亲情结如此明显，以至于迪克为所有心理学家都为这种恶毒的多愁善感感到畏缩。屏幕消失，灯光亮起，那一刻已经到来。

‘I’ve arranged one other thing,’ announced Rosemary to the company at large, ‘I’ve arranged a test for Dick.’
“我还安排了另一件事，”罗斯玛丽向全公司宣布，“我为迪克安排了一次测试。”

‘A what?’
“什么？”

‘A screen test, they’ll take one now.’
“屏幕测试，他们现在就进行一次。”

There was an awful silence—then an irrepressible chortle from the Norths. Rosemary watched Dick comprehend what she meant, his face moving first in an Irish way; simultaneously she realized that she had made some mistake in the playing of her trump and still she did not suspect that the card was at fault.
一阵可怕的沉默——然后是北方人抑制不住的咯咯笑声。罗斯玛丽看着迪克理解了她的意思，他的脸首先以爱尔兰方式移动。与此同时，她意识到自己在打王牌时犯了一些错误，但她仍然不怀疑这张牌有问题。

‘I don’t want a test,’ said Dick firmly; then, seeing the situation as a whole, he continued lightly, ‘Rosemary, I’m disappointed. The pictures make a fine career for a woman—but my God, they can’t photograph me. I’m an old scientist all wrapped up in his private life.’
“我不想测试，”迪克坚定地说。然后，看清整个情况，他淡淡地继续道：“罗斯玛丽，我很失望。”拍照片对女人来说是一个很好的职业——但天哪，他们不能拍我。我是一位老科学家，一心沉浸在自己的私生活中。”

Nicole and Mary urged him ironically to seize the opportunity; they teased him, both faintly annoyed at not having been asked for a sitting. But Dick closed the subject with a somewhat tart discussion of actors: ‘The strongest guard is placed at the gateway to nothing,’ he said. ‘Maybe because the condition of emptiness is too shameful to be divulged.’
妮可和玛丽讽刺地敦促他抓住这个机会。他们取笑他，两人都因为没有被要求坐下而感到有点恼火。但迪克以对演员的有点尖刻的讨论结束了这个话题：“最强大的守卫被放置在通向虚无的门口，”他说。 “也许是因为空虚的状态实在是太丢脸了，不能透露。”

In the taxi with Dick and Collis Clay—they were dropping Collis, and Dick was taking Rosemary to a tea from which Nicole and the Norths had resigned in order to do the things Abe had left undone till the last—in the taxi Rosemary reproached him.
在迪克和科利斯·克莱的出租车上——他们要丢下科利斯，迪克正带罗斯玛丽去喝茶，妮可和诺斯夫妇已经辞去茶会，以便完成安倍留到最后的事情——在出租车上，罗斯玛丽责备了他。

‘I thought if the test turned out to be good I could take it to California with me. And then maybe if they liked it you’d come out and be my leading man in a picture.’
“我想，如果测试结果很好，我可以带着它去加州。然后也许如果他们喜欢的话你就会出来成为我电影中的男主角。

He was overwhelmed. ‘It was a darn sweet thought, but I’d rather look at YOU. You were about the nicest sight I ever looked at.’
他不知所措。 “这是一个非常甜蜜的想法，但我宁愿看着你。”你是我见过的最美的景象。

‘That’s a great picture,’ said Collis. ‘I’ve seen it four times. I know one boy at New Haven who’s seen it a dozen times—he went all the way to Hartford to see it one time. And when I brought Rosemary up to New Haven he was so shy he wouldn’t meet her. Can you beat that? This little girl knocks them cold.’
“那是一张很棒的照片，”科利斯说。 ‘我已经看过四次了。我认识一个纽黑文的男孩，他已经看过十几次了——他专程去哈特福德看过一次。当我带罗斯玛丽去纽黑文时，他很害羞，不愿见到她。你能打败它吗？这个小女孩让他们感到寒冷。

Dick and Rosemary looked at each other, wanting to be alone, but Collis failed to understand.
迪克和罗斯玛丽面面相觑，想要独处，但科利斯无法理解。

‘I’ll drop you where you’re going,’ he suggested. ‘I’m staying at the Lutetia.’
“我会把你送到你要去的地方，”他建议道。 “我住在卢腾西亚酒店。”

‘We’ll drop you,’ said Dick.
“我们会把你送走的，”迪克说。

‘It’ll be easier for me to drop you. No trouble at all.’
‘这样我就更容易丢下你了。一点也不麻烦。

‘I think it will be better if we drop you.’
“我认为我们放弃你会更好。”

‘But—‘ began Collis; he grasped the situation at last and began discussing with Rosemary when he would see her again.
“但是——”科利斯开口说道。他终于明白了情况，并开始与罗斯玛丽讨论何时再见到她。

Finally, he was gone, with the shadowy unimportance but the offensive bulk of the third party. The car stopped unexpectedly, unsatisfactorily, at the address Dick had given. He drew a long breath.
最后，他离开了，带着一个不重要但令人反感的第三方。汽车意外地、令人不满意地停在迪克给出的地址处。他长长地吸了一口气。

‘Shall we go in?’
“我们进去吧？”

‘I don’t care,’ Rosemary said. ‘I’ll do anything you want.’
“我不在乎，”罗斯玛丽说。 “我会做任何你想做的事。”

He considered.
他想。

‘I almost have to go in—she wants to buy some pictures from a friend of mine who needs the money.’
“我几乎得进去了——她想从我一个需要钱的朋友那里买一些照片。”

Rosemary smoothed the brief expressive disarray of her hair.
迷迭香抚平了她暂时凌乱的头发。

‘We’ll stay just five minutes,’ he decided. ‘You’re not going to like these people.’
“我们只待五分钟，”他决定。 “你不会喜欢这些人的。”

She assumed that they were dull and stereotyped people, or gross and drunken people, or tiresome, insistent people, or any of the sorts of people that the Divers avoided. She was entirely unprepared for the impression that the scene made on her.
她认为他们是迟钝和刻板的人，或者是粗鲁和醉酒的人，或者是令人厌烦、坚持不懈的人，或者是戴弗夫妇回避的任何类型的人。她对这一幕给她留下的印象完全没有准备。

十七

It was a house hewn from the frame of Cardinal de Retz’s palace in the Rue Monsieur, but once inside the door there was nothing of the past, nor of any present that Rosemary knew. The outer shell, the masonry, seemed rather to enclose the future so that it was an electric-like shock, a definite nervous experience, perverted as a breakfast of oatmeal and hashish, to cross that threshold, if it could be so called, into the long hall of blue steel, silver-gilt, and the myriad facets of many oddly bevelled mirrors. The effect was unlike that of any part of the Decorative Arts Exhibition—for there were people IN it, not in front of it. Rosemary had the detached false-and-exalted feeling of being on a set and she guessed that every one else present had that feeling too.
这是一栋由雷茨红衣主教位于先生街的宫殿框架凿成的房子，但一进门，就看不到过去的一切，也没有罗斯玛丽所知道的任何现在的东西。外壳，砖石，似乎封闭了未来，因此这是一种电击般的冲击，一种明确的紧张体验，扭曲为燕麦片和大麻的早餐，跨越那个门槛，如果可以这么说的话，进入长长的蓝钢、镀银大厅，以及许多奇怪的斜面镜子的无数面。这种效果与装饰艺术展的任何部分都不同——因为有人在里面，而不是在它前面。罗斯玛丽有一种置身于片场的超然、虚假和崇高的感觉，她猜在场的其他人也有这种感觉。

There were about thirty people, mostly women, and all fashioned by Louisa M. Alcott or Madame de Ségur; and they functioned on this set as cautiously, as precisely, as does a human hand picking up jagged broken glass. Neither individually nor as a crowd could they be said to dominate the environment, as one comes to dominate a work of art he may possess, no matter how esoteric, no one knew what this room meant because it was evolving into something else, becoming everything a room was not; to exist in it was as difficult as walking on a highly polished moving stairway, and no one could succeed at all save with the aforementioned qualities of a hand moving among broken glass—which qualities limited and defined the majority of those present.
大约有三十个人，大多数是女性，都是由路易莎·M·奥尔科特或德·塞居尔夫人塑造的。他们在这个场景中的动作就像人手捡起锯齿状的碎玻璃一样谨慎、精确。无论是个人还是群体，都不能说他们主宰了环境，因为一个人开始主宰他可能拥有的一件艺术品，无论多么深奥，没有人知道这个房间意味着什么，因为它正在进化成其他东西，成为一切一个房间没有；在其中生存就像走在高度抛光的移动楼梯上一样困难，除了前面提到的在碎玻璃中移动的手的品质之外，没有人能够成功——这种品质限制并定义了在场的大多数人。

These were of two sorts. There were the Americans and English who had been dissipating all spring and summer, so that now everything they did had a purely nervous inspiration. They were very quiet and lethargic at certain hours and then they exploded into sudden quarrels and breakdowns and seductions. The other class, who might be called the exploiters, was formed by the sponges, who were sober, serious people by comparison, with a purpose in life and no time for fooling. These kept their balance best in that environment, and what tone there was, beyond the apartment’s novel organization of light values, came from them.
这些有两种。美国人和英国人整个春天和夏天都在放荡，所以现在他们所做的一切都纯粹是出于紧张的灵感。他们在某些时候非常安静、昏昏欲睡，然后突然爆发争吵、崩溃和诱惑。另一类，可以被称为剥削者，是由海绵组成的，相比之下，他们是清醒、严肃的人，有生活目标，没有时间愚弄。这些在那个环境中保持了最好的平衡，除了公寓新颖的光值组织之外，还有什么基调来自它们。

The Frankenstein took down Dick and Rosemary at a gulp—it separated them immediately and Rosemary suddenly discovered herself to be an insincere little person, living all in the upper registers of her throat and wishing the director would come. There was however such a wild beating of wings in the room that she did not feel her position was more incongruous than any one else’s. In addition, her training told and after a series of semi-military turns, shifts, and marches she found herself presumably talking to a neat, slick girl with a lovely boy’s face, but actually absorbed by a conversation taking place on a sort of gun-metal ladder diagonally opposite her and four feet away.
弗兰肯斯坦一口气吞下了迪克和罗斯玛丽——他们立刻分开了，罗斯玛丽突然发现自己是个不真诚的小人，全都活在喉咙的上音域，希望导演能来。然而房间里的翅膀拍打声如此剧烈，她并不觉得自己的位置比其他人更不协调。此外，她的训练告诉我们，经过一系列半军事化的转弯、轮班和行军后，她发现自己大概是在和一个整洁、圆滑、长着一张可爱男孩脸的女孩交谈，但实际上却被一种枪上发生的谈话所吸引。 -金属梯子位于她斜对面，距她四英尺远。

There was a trio of young women sitting on the bench. They were all tall and slender with small heads groomed like manikins’ heads, and as they talked the heads waved gracefully about above their dark tailored suits, rather like long-stemmed flowers and rather like cobras’ hoods.
长凳上坐着三个年轻女子。他们个个又高又瘦，小脑袋打扮得像人体模型的脑袋，说话的时候，脑袋在深色定制西装上优雅地摇晃着，像长茎花，又像眼镜蛇的头巾。

‘Oh, they give a good show,’ said one of them, in a deep rich voice. ‘Practically the best show in Paris—I’d be the last one to deny that. But after all—‘ She sighed. ‘Those phrases he uses over and over—‘Oldest inhabitant gnawed by rodents.’ You laugh once.’
“哦，他们表演得很精彩，”其中一个人用低沉浑厚的声音说道。 “这几乎是巴黎最好的演出——我是最后一个否认这一点的人。但毕竟——”她叹了口气。 “他一遍又一遍地使用这些短语——‘最古老的居民被啮齿动物咬伤了。’你笑一次。”

‘I prefer people whose lives have more corrugated surfaces,’ said the second, ‘and I don’t like her.’
“我更喜欢那些生活充满波折的人，”第二个说，“但我不喜欢她。”

‘I’ve never really been able to get very excited about them, or their entourage either. Why, for example, the entirely liquid Mr. North?’
“我从来没有真正对他们或他们的随行人员感到非常兴奋。例如，为什么是完全流动的诺斯先生？

‘He’s out,’ said the first girl. ‘But you must admit that the party in question can be one of the most charming human beings you have ever met.’
“他出去了，”第一个女孩说。 “但你必须承认，对方可能是你见过的最有魅力的人之一。”

It was the first hint Rosemary had had that they were talking about the Divers, and her body grew tense with indignation. But the girl talking to her, in the starched blue shirt with the bright blue eyes and the red cheeks and the very gray suit, a poster of a girl, had begun to play up. Desperately she kept sweeping things from between them, afraid that Rosemary couldn’t see her, sweeping them away until presently there was not so much as a veil of brittle humor hiding the girl, and with distaste Rosemary saw her plain.
这是罗斯玛丽第一次感觉到他们正在谈论戴弗夫妇，她的身体因愤怒而紧张起来。但是那个和她说话的女孩，穿着浆过的蓝色衬衫，有着明亮的蓝眼睛和红色的脸颊，穿着非常灰色的套装，一张女孩的海报，已经开始出现了。她拼命地不停地扫着他们之间的东西，生怕罗斯玛丽看不到她，直到不久，女孩身上就连一层脆弱的幽默的面纱都没有了，罗斯玛丽厌恶地看着她。

‘Couldn’t you have lunch, or maybe dinner, or lunch the day after?’ begged the girl. Rosemary looked about for Dick, finding him with the hostess, to whom he had been talking since they came in. Their eyes met and he nodded slightly, and simultaneously the three cobra women noticed her; their long necks darted toward her and they fixed finely critical glances upon her. She looked back at them defiantly, acknowledging that she had heard what they said. Then she threw off her exigent vis-à-vis with a polite but clipped parting that she had just learned from Dick, and went over to join him. The hostess—she was another tall rich American girl, promenading insouciantly upon the national prosperity—was asking Dick innumerable questions about Gausse’s Hôtel, whither she evidently wanted to come, and battering persistently against his reluctance. Rosemary’s presence reminded her that she had been recalcitrant as a hostess and glancing about she said: ‘Have you met any one amusing, have you met Mr.—‘ Her eyes groped for a male who might interest Rosemary, but Dick said they must go. They left immediately, moving over the brief threshold of the future to the sudden past of the stone façade without.
“你不能吃午饭吗？也许晚饭，或者后天吃午饭吗？”女孩恳求道。罗斯玛丽四处寻找迪克，发现他和女主人在一起，自从他们进来以来，他一直在和女主人说话。他们的目光相遇，他轻轻点了点头，同时三个眼镜蛇女人注意到了她；他们的目光相遇了，他轻轻地点了点头。他们的长脖子伸向她，用挑剔的目光注视着她。她挑衅地回头看着他们，承认她听到了他们说的话。然后，她用她刚刚从迪克那里学来的礼貌而简短的告别语，摆脱了她的迫切要求，走过去和他会合。女主人——她是另一位身材高大、富有的美国女孩，漫不经心地漫步在国家繁荣的景象中——正在向迪克询问无数关于高斯旅馆的问题，她显然想去那里，并不断地反对他的不情愿。罗斯玛丽的出现让她想起自己作为女主人一直很不听话，她环顾四周说道：“你有没有遇到过有趣的人，你有没有遇到过先生——”她的目光在寻找一位可能会让罗斯玛丽感兴趣的男性，但迪克说他们必须离开。 。他们立即离开，越过未来的短暂门槛，来到外面突然过去的石头外墙。

‘Wasn’t it terrible?’ he said.
“这不是很可怕吗？”他说。

‘Terrible,’ she echoed obediently.
“太糟糕了，”她顺从地重复道。

‘Rosemary?’
'迷迭香？'

She murmured, ‘What?’ in an awed voice.
她用敬畏的声音低声说：“什么？”

‘I feel terribly about this.’
“我对此感到非常难过。”

She was shaken with audibly painful sobs. ‘Have you got a handkerchief?’ she faltered. But there was little time to cry, and lovers now they fell ravenously on the quick seconds while outside the taxi windows the green and cream twilight faded, and the firered, gas-blue, ghost-green signs began to shine smokily through the tranquil rain. It was nearly six, the streets were in movement, the bistros gleamed, the Place de la Concorde moved by in pink majesty as the cab turned north.
她浑身发抖，发出痛苦的抽泣声。 “你有手帕吗？”她结结巴巴地说。但几乎没有时间哭泣，现在，恋人们在短短的几秒钟内贪婪地坠入爱河，出租车窗外的绿色和奶油色暮光渐渐褪去，火红色、气蓝色、鬼绿色的标志开始在宁静的雨中闪烁着烟雾。 。已经快六点了，街道上熙熙攘攘，小酒馆闪闪发光，出租车向北行驶时，协和广场呈现出粉红色的威严。

They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a spell. Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the mind.
他们最后互相看着对方，低声念叨着咒语般的名字。这两个名字轻轻地在空气中徘徊，比其他词语、其他名字更慢地消失，比脑海中的音乐更慢。

‘I don’t know what came over me last night,’ Rosemary said. ‘That glass of champagne? I’ve never done anything like that before.’
“我不知道昨晚发生了什么，”罗斯玛丽说。 ‘那杯香槟？我以前从未做过这样的事情。

‘You simply said you loved me.’
“你只是说你爱我。”

‘I do love you—I can’t change that.’ It was time for Rosemary to cry, so she cried a little in her handkerchief.
“我确实爱你——我无法改变这一点。”罗斯玛丽该哭了，所以她用手帕哭了一会儿。

‘I’m afraid I’m in love with you,’ said Dick, ‘and that’s not the best thing that could happen.’
“恐怕我爱上了你，”迪克说，“但这不是最好的事情。”

Again the names—then they lurched together as if the taxi had swung them. Her breasts crushed flat against him, her mouth was all new and warm, owned in common. They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other. They were both in the gray gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs. Nerves so raw and tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips, breast to breast... .
又是名字——然后他们摇摇晃晃地靠在一起，就像出租车摇晃着他们一样。她的乳房平贴在他身上，她的嘴唇崭新而温暖，是共同的。他们停止了思考，几乎痛苦地松了口气，停止了观察；他们停止了思考。他们只是呼吸并互相寻找。他们都处于轻度宿醉的灰色温柔世界中，神经像钢琴弦一样放松，突然像藤椅一样噼啪作响。如此原始而脆弱的神经肯定会与其他神经相连，嘴唇与嘴唇，乳房与乳房……。

They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine.
他们还处于爱情的幸福阶段。他们对彼此充满了勇敢的幻想，巨大的幻想，因此自我与自我的交流似乎处于一个其他人际关系都不重要的层面上。他们俩似乎都带着一种非凡的纯真到达了那里，仿佛一系列纯粹的意外事件使他们走到了一起，如此多的意外事件以至于最后他们被迫得出结论：他们是彼此相爱的。他们来得很干净，至少看起来是这样，没有与纯粹好奇和秘密的人来往。

But for Dick that portion of the road was short; the turning came before they reached the hotel.
但对迪克来说，那段路很短；他们到达旅馆之前就遇到了转弯。

‘There’s nothing to do about it,’ he said, with a feeling of panic. ‘I’m in love with you but it doesn’t change what I said last night.’
“对此我们无能为力，”他带着惊慌的心情说道。 “我爱你，但这并没有改变我昨晚说的话。”

‘That doesn’t matter now. I just wanted to make you love me—if you love me everything’s all right.’
‘现在那不重要了。我只是想让你爱我——如果你爱我一切都好。

‘Unfortunately I do. But Nicole mustn’t know—she mustn’t suspect even faintly. Nicole and I have got to go on together. In a way that’s more important than just wanting to go on.’
'不幸的是我确实如此。但妮可不能知道——她不能有哪怕是微弱的怀疑。妮可和我必须一起走下去。从某种程度上来说，这比仅仅想继续下去更重要。”

‘Kiss me once more.’
“再吻我一次。”

He kissed her, but momentarily he had left her.
他吻了她，但很快就离开了她。

‘Nicole mustn’t suffer—she loves me and I love her—you understand that.’
“妮可不能受苦——她爱我，我也爱她——你明白这一点。”

She did understand—it was the sort of thing she understood well, not hurting people. She knew the Divers loved each other because it had been her primary assumption. She had thought however that it was a rather cooled relation, and actually rather like the love of herself and her mother. When people have so much for outsiders didn’t it indicate a lack of inner intensity?
她确实明白——这是她很明白的事情，不会伤害别人。她知道戴弗夫妇彼此相爱，因为这是她的首要假设。但她原以为这是一种相当冷淡的关系，实际上很像她自己和母亲的爱。当人们对外人拥有如此多的东西时，这是否表明缺乏内在的强度？

‘And I mean love,’ he said, guessing her thoughts. ‘Active love— it’s more complicated than I can tell you. It was responsible for that crazy duel.’
“我指的是爱，”他猜到了她的想法。 “主动的爱——比我能告诉你的还要复杂。它是那场疯狂决斗的罪魁祸首。

‘How did you know about the duel? I thought we were to keep it from you.’
‘你怎么知道决斗的事的？我以为我们应该瞒着你。

‘Do you think Abe can keep a secret?’ He spoke with incisive irony. ‘Tell a secret over the radio, publish it in a tabloid, but never tell it to a man who drinks more than three or four a day.’
“你认为安倍能保守秘密吗？”他语气尖锐地讽刺道。 “通过广播讲述一个秘密，在小报上发布它，但永远不要告诉一个每天喝酒超过三四杯的人。”

She laughed in agreement, staying close to him.
她微笑着表示同意，并靠近他。

‘So you understand my relations with Nicole are complicated. She’s not very strong—she looks strong but she isn’t. And this makes rather a mess.’
“所以你明白我和妮可的关系很复杂。她不是很坚强——她看起来很坚强，但实际上并非如此。这让事情变得相当混乱。

‘Oh, say that later! But kiss me now—love me now. I’ll love you and never let Nicole see.’
「哦，那以后再说吧！但现在就吻我——现在就爱我。我会爱你，永远不会让妮可看到。

‘You darling.’
“你亲爱的。”

They reached the hotel and Rosemary walked a little behind him, to admire him, to adore him. His step was alert as if he had just come from some great doings and was hurrying on toward others. Organizer of private gaiety, curator of a richly incrusted happiness. His hat was a perfect hat and he carried a heavy stick and yellow gloves. She thought what a good time they would all have being with him to-night.
他们到达酒店，罗斯玛丽走在他身后不远的地方，欣赏他，崇拜他。他的脚步很警惕，仿佛刚刚完成了一些伟大的事情，正急匆匆地奔向其他人。私人欢乐的组织者，丰富幸福的管理者。他的帽子是一顶完美的帽子，他带着一根沉重的棍子和黄色手套。她想今晚他们和他在一起会是多么美好的时光啊。

They walked upstairs—five flights. At the first landing they stopped and kissed; she was careful on the next landing, on the third more careful still. On the next—there were two more—she stopped half way and kissed him fleetingly good-by. At his urgency she walked down with him to the one below for a minute—and then up and up. Finally it was good-by with their hands stretching to touch along the diagonal of the banister and then the fingers slipping apart. Dick went back downstairs to make some arrangements for the evening—Rosemary ran to her room and wrote a letter to her mother; she was conscience-stricken because she did not miss her mother at all.
他们走上楼——五层楼。在第一次着陆时，他们停下来接吻。她在下一次着陆时非常小心，在第三次着陆时更加小心。下一次——还有两次——她中途停了下来，与他短暂地吻别。在他的紧急情况下，她和他一起走到楼下，呆了一分钟，然后又向上走。最后，他们的手伸向栏杆的对角线，然后手指滑开，告别了。迪克下楼去安排晚上的事情——罗斯玛丽跑到她的房间给她妈妈写了一封信；她良心受到打击，因为她根本没有想念她的母亲。

十八

Although the Divers were honestly apathetic to organized fashion, they were nevertheless too acute to abandon its contemporaneous rhythm and beat—Dick’s parties were all concerned with excitement, and a chance breath of fresh night air was the more precious for being experienced in the intervals of the excitement.
尽管戴弗夫妇确实对有组织的时尚漠不关心，但他们还是太敏锐了，无法放弃同时代的节奏和节拍——迪克的派对都充满了兴奋，在晚上呼吸新鲜空气的机会对于体验更珍贵。兴奋。

The party that night moved with the speed of a slapstick comedy. They were twelve, they were sixteen, they were quartets in separate motors bound on a quick Odyssey over Paris. Everything had been foreseen. People joined them as if by magic, accompanied them as specialists, almost guides, through a phase of the evening, dropped out and were succeeded by other people, so that it appeared as if the freshness of each one had been husbanded for them all day. Rosemary appreciated how different it was from any party in Hollywood, no matter how splendid in scale. There was, among many diversions, the car of the Shah of Persia. Where Dick had commandeered this vehicle, what bribery was employed, these were facts of irrelevance. Rosemary accepted it as merely a new facet of the fabulous, which for two years had filled her life. The car had been built on a special chassis in America. Its wheels were of silver, so was the radiator. The inside of the body was inlaid with innumerable brilliants which would be replaced with true gems by the court jeweller when the car arrived in Teheran the following week. There was only one real seat in back, because the Shah must ride alone, so they took turns riding in it and sitting on the marten fur that covered the floor.
那天晚上的聚会以滑稽喜剧的速度进行。他们十二岁，十六岁，他们是四人组，驾驶着不同的发动机，踏上巴黎上空的快速奥德赛之旅。一切都已经预料到了。人们像魔法一样加入了他们，作为专家、几乎是向导陪伴着他们，度过了晚上的一个阶段，然后退出并由其他人接替，因此看起来好像每个人的新鲜感都为他们保留了一整天。罗斯玛丽很欣赏这与好莱坞任何派对的不同之处，无论规模多么华丽。在众多消遣中，有波斯国王的汽车。迪克在哪里征用了这辆车，采用了什么贿赂手段，这些都是无关紧要的事实。罗斯玛丽认为这只是神话的一个新方面，两年来，这已经充满了她的生活。该车是在美国的特殊底盘上制造的。它的轮子是银色的，散热器也是银色的。车身内部镶嵌着无数的宝石，当汽车在下周抵达德黑兰时，宫廷珠宝商将用真正的宝石替换这些宝石。后面只有一个真正的座位，因为国王必须单独骑马，所以他们轮流坐在里面，坐在铺满地板的貂皮上。

But always there was Dick. Rosemary assured the image of her mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had she known any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as Dick was that night. She compared him with the two Englishmen, whom Abe addressed conscientiously as ‘Major Hengest and Mr. Horsa,’ and with the heir to a Scandinavian throne and the novelist just back from Russia, and with Abe, who was desperate and witty, and with Collis Clay, who joined them somewhere and stayed along—and felt there was no comparison. The enthusiasm, the selflessness behind the whole performance ravished her, the technic of moving many varied types, each as immobile, as dependent on supplies of attention as an infantry battalion is dependent on rations, appeared so effortless that he still had pieces of his own most personal self for everyone.
但迪克一直都在。罗斯玛丽向她母亲的形象保证，她从来没有认识过任何一个人像那天晚上迪克那样友善，如此彻底。她将他与安倍认真称呼为“亨格斯特少校和霍萨先生”的两个英国人、斯堪的纳维亚王位继承人和刚从俄罗斯回来的小说家、绝望而机智的安倍以及科利斯·克莱（Collis Clay）在某个地方加入了他们并留下来——他觉得没有可比性。整个表演背后的热情和无私让她着迷，移动许多不同类型的技术，每个类型都一动不动，依赖注意力的供应，就像步兵营依赖口粮一样，看起来如此轻松，以至于他仍然有自己的碎片每个人最个性化的自我。

—Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the happiest. The first time was when she and Dick danced together and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong form as they floated, hovering like people in an amusing dream—he turned her here and there with such a delicacy of suggestion that she was like a bright bouquet, a piece of precious cloth being displayed before fifty eyes. There was a moment when they were not dancing at all, simply clinging together. Some time in the early morning they were alone, and her damp powdery young body came up close to him in a crush of tired cloth, and stayed there, crushed against a background of other people’s hats and wraps... .
——后来她想起了自己最幸福的时光。第一次是当她和迪克一起跳舞时，她感到自己的美丽在他高大、强壮的体形的衬托下闪闪发光，他们漂浮着，盘旋着，就像人们在一个有趣的梦中一样——他把她转来转去，暗示她是就像一束鲜艳的花束，一块珍贵的布料展示在五十只眼睛面前。有一段时间，他们根本没有跳舞，只是紧紧地贴在一起。清晨的某个时候，他们独自一人，她湿漉漉、粉嫩的、年轻的身体裹着一团疲惫的衣服，靠近他，呆在那里，压在其他人的帽子和围巾的背景下……

The time she laughed most was later, when six of them, the best of them, noblest relics of the evening, stood in the dusky front lobby of the Ritz telling the night concierge that General Pershing was outside and wanted caviare and champagne. ‘He brooks no delay. Every man, every gun is at his service.’ Frantic waiters emerged from nowhere, a table was set in the lobby, and Abe came in representing General Pershing while they stood up and mumbled remembered fragments of war songs at him. In the waiters’ injured reaction to this anti-climax they found themselves neglected, so they built a waiter trap—a huge and fantastic device constructed of all the furniture in the lobby and functioning like one of the bizarre machines of a Goldberg cartoon. Abe shook his head doubtfully at it.
她笑得最多的时候是后来，当时六个人，他们中最好的，当晚最高贵的遗迹，站在丽兹酒店昏暗的前厅里，告诉夜间礼宾员潘兴将军在外面，想要鱼子酱和香槟。 ‘他不能再拖延了。每个人，每把枪都为他服务。” 疯狂的服务员不知从哪里冒了出来，大厅里摆好了一张桌子，安倍代表潘兴将军进来，而他们站起来，向他咕哝着记忆中的战歌片段。在服务员对这种反高潮的受伤反应中，他们发现自己被忽视了，所以他们建造了一个服务员陷阱——一个巨大而奇妙的装置，由大厅里的所有家具组成，其功能就像戈德堡卡通片中的奇异机器之一。安倍对此疑惑地摇摇头。

‘Perhaps it would be better to steal a musical saw and—‘
“也许偷一把琴锯会更好，然后——”

‘That’s enough,’ Mary interrupted. ‘When Abe begins bringing up that it’s time to go home.’ Anxiously she confided to Rosemary:
“够了，”玛丽打断道。 “当安倍开始说是时候回家了。”她焦急地向罗斯玛丽吐露道：

‘I’ve got to get Abe home. His boat train leaves at eleven. It’s so important—I feel the whole future depends on his catching it, but whenever I argue with him he does the exact opposite.’
“我得送安倍回家。他的火车十一点出发。这非常重要——我觉得整个未来都取决于他能否抓住它，但每当我与他争论时，他就会做完全相反的事情。

‘I’ll try and persuade him,’ offered Rosemary.
“我会尽力说服他，”罗斯玛丽说道。

‘Would you?’ Mary said doubtfully. ‘Maybe you could.’
“你愿意吗？”玛丽疑惑地说。 '也许你可以。'

Then Dick came up to Rosemary:
然后迪克走到罗斯玛丽面前：

‘Nicole and I are going home and we thought you’d want to go with us.’
“妮可和我要回家，我们认为你会想和我们一起去。”

Her face was pale with fatigue in the false dawn. Two wan dark spots in her cheek marked where the color was by day.
在虚假的黎明中，她的脸色因疲倦而苍白。她脸颊上有两个苍白的黑斑，标志着白天的颜色。

‘I can’t,’ she said. ‘I promised Mary North to stay along with them—or Abe’ll never go to bed. Maybe you could do something.’
“我不能，”她说。 “我答应玛丽·诺斯会和他们在一起，否则安倍永远不会上床睡觉。也许你可以做点什么。

‘Don’t you know you can’t do anything about people?’ he advised her. ‘If Abe was my room-mate in college, tight for the first time, it’d be different. Now there’s nothing to do.’
“你难道不知道你对人无能为力吗？”他劝告她。 “如果安倍是我大学时的室友，第一次关系亲密，情况就会不同。现在无事可做。

‘Well, I’ve got to stay. He says he’ll go to bed if we only come to the Halles with him,’ she said, almost defiantly.
‘好吧，我必须留下来。他说只要我们和他一起去大厅，他就会去睡觉。”她几乎是挑衅地说道。

He kissed the inside of her elbow quickly.
他飞快地吻了一下她的肘部内侧。

‘Don’t let Rosemary go home alone,’ Nicole called to Mary as they left. ‘We feel responsible to her mother.’
“别让罗斯玛丽独自回家，”他们离开时妮可对玛丽喊道。 “我们对她的母亲负有责任。”

—Later Rosemary and the Norths and a manufacturer of dolls’ voices from Newark and ubiquitous Collis and a big splendidly dressed oil Indian named George T. Horseprotection were riding along on top of thousands of carrots in a market wagon. The earth in the carrot beards was fragrant and sweet in the darkness, and Rosemary was so high up in the load that she could hardly see the others in the long shadow between infrequent street lamps. Their voices came from far off, as if they were having experiences different from hers, different and far away, for she was with Dick in her heart, sorry she had come with the Norths, wishing she was at the hotel and him asleep across the hall, or that he was here beside her with the warm darkness streaming down.
——后来，罗斯玛丽和诺斯一家、来自纽瓦克的玩偶声音制造商、无处不在的科利斯和一个衣着光鲜亮丽、名叫乔治·T·霍斯保护的大块头印第安人，在一辆市场马车上骑着数千根胡萝卜。胡萝卜胡须中的泥土在黑暗中芬芳而甜美，而罗斯玛丽在负载中是如此之高，以至于她几乎看不到路灯之间的长阴影中的其他人。他们的声音从很远的地方传来，仿佛他们正在经历与她不同的经历，不同而遥远，因为她心里和迪克在一起，抱歉她和诺斯一起来，希望她在酒店而他在对面睡着。大厅里，或者他就在她身边，温暖的黑暗流淌下来。

‘Don’t come up,’ she called to Collis, ‘the carrots will all roll.’ She threw one at Abe who was sitting beside the driver, stiffly like an old man... .
“别上来，”她对科利斯喊道，“胡萝卜都会滚起来。”她把一根扔给坐在司机旁边的阿贝，阿贝僵硬得像个老人……

Later she was homeward bound at last in broad daylight, with the pigeons already breaking over Saint-Sulpice. All of them began to laugh spontaneously because they knew it was still last night while the people in the streets had the delusion that it was bright hot morning.
后来，她终于在光天化日之下启程回家，鸽子们已经飞越了圣叙尔皮斯。众人不约而同地笑了起来，因为他们知道这还是昨晚，而街上的人们却误以为现在是明媚炎热的早晨。

‘At last I’ve been on a wild party,’ thought Rosemary, ‘but it’s no fun when Dick isn’t there.’
“我终于参加了一场疯狂的派对，”罗斯玛丽想，“但是迪克不在的时候就没啥乐趣了。”

She felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving object came into sight. It was a huge horse-chestnut tree in full bloom bound for the Champs Élysées, strapped now into a long truck and simply shaking with laughter—like a lovely person in an undignified position yet confident none the less of being lovely. Looking at it with fascination Rosemary identified herself with it, and laughed cheerfully with it, and everything all at once seemed gorgeous.
她感到有些被背叛和悲伤，但很快，一个移动的物体出现在了她的视线中。那是一棵巨大的七叶树，盛开着，开往香榭丽舍大街，现在被绑在一辆长卡车上，只是笑得发抖——就像一个可爱的人，虽然姿势不庄严，但仍然自信地可爱。迷迭香着迷地看着它，与它融为一体，并与它一起欢快地笑，一切都显得华丽起来。

十九

Abe left from the Gare Saint Lazare at eleven—he stood alone under the fouled glass dome, relic of the seventies, era of the Crystal Palace; his hands, of that vague gray color that only twenty-four hours can produce, were in his coat pockets to conceal the trembling fingers. With his hat removed it was plain that only the top layer of his hair was brushed back—the lower levels were pointed resolutely sidewise. He was scarcely recognizable as the man who had swum upon Gausse’s Beach a fortnight ago.
阿部十一点从圣拉扎尔火车站出发——他独自站在污浊的玻璃穹顶下，那是七十年代水晶宫时代的遗迹；他的双手，只有二十四小时才能呈现出的那种模糊的灰色，插在外套口袋里，以掩盖颤抖的手指。摘下帽子后，很明显，他只把最上面的头发梳到后面，下面的头发则坚决地斜向一边。几乎认不出他就是两周前在高斯海滩游泳的那个人。

He was early; he looked from left to right with his eyes only; it would have taken nervous forces out of his control to use any other part of his body. New-looking baggage went past him; presently prospective passengers, with dark little bodies, were calling: ‘Jew-uls-HOO-OO!’ in dark piercing voices.
他来得很早；他只用眼睛从左向右看；如果使用身体的任何其他部位，他的神经力量就会失去控制。崭新的行李从他身边走过；目前即将到来的乘客，身材黝黑，正在用黑暗刺耳的声音喊着：“Jew-uls-HOO-OO！”

At the minute when he wondered whether or not he had time for a drink at the buffet, and began clutching at the soggy wad of thousand-franc notes in his pocket, one end of his pendulous glance came to rest upon the apparition of Nicole at the stairhead. He watched her—she was self-revelatory in her little expressions as people seem to some one waiting for them, who as yet is himself unobserved. She was frowning, thinking of her children, less gloating over them than merely animally counting them—a cat checking her cubs with a paw.
当他想知道自己是否有时间在自助餐厅喝一杯，并开始抓起口袋里那一叠湿漉漉的千法郎钞票时，他下垂的目光的一端停在了妮可的幽灵上。楼梯口。他看着她——她的小表情透露着自我，就像人们在等待着他们一样，而他自己却未被注意到。她皱着眉头，想着她的孩子们，与其说是对他们幸灾乐祸，不如说是动物般地数着他们——一只猫用爪子检查着她的幼崽。

When she saw Abe, the mood passed out of her face; the glow of the morning skylight was sad, and Abe made a gloomy figure with dark circles that showed through the crimson tan under his eyes. They sat down on a bench.
当她看到阿部时，脸上的情绪消失了。清晨的天光透着悲伤，阿部的身影阴郁，深红色的棕褐色眼睛下面露出了黑眼圈。他们在长凳上坐下。

‘I came because you asked me,’ said Nicole defensively. Abe seemed to have forgotten why he asked her and Nicole was quite content to look at the travellers passing by.
“我来是因为你问我，”妮可辩解道。安倍似乎忘记了自己为什么问她，而妮可则很满足地看着路过的旅人。

‘That’s going to be the belle of your boat—that one with all the men to say good-by—you see why she bought that dress?’ Nicole talked faster and faster. ‘You see why nobody else would buy it except the belle of the world cruise? See? No? Wake up! That’s a story dress—that extra material tells a story and somebody on world cruise would be lonesome enough to want to hear it.’
“那将是你船上的美女——那个要和所有男人告别的人——你明白她为什么买那件衣服了吗？”妮可说得越来越快。 “你知道为什么除了环球航行的美女之外没有其他人会买它吗？”看？不？醒来！这是一件有故事的衣服——额外的材料讲述了一个故事，环游世界的人会很孤独地想听它。

She bit close her last words; she had talked too much for her; and Abe found it difficult to gather from her serious set face that she had spoken at all. With an effort he drew himself up to a posture that looked as if he were standing up while he was sitting down.
她咬紧牙关说出最后一句话；她为她说了太多；阿贝发现很难从她严肃的表情中看出她到底说过话。他努力摆出一个姿势，看起来就像是坐着，但又像是站着。

‘The afternoon you took me to that funny ball—you know, St. Genevieve’s—‘ he began.
“那天下午你带我去参加那个有趣的舞会——你知道，圣吉纳维芙舞会——”他开始说道。

‘I remember. It was fun, wasn’t it?’
'我记得。这很有趣，不是吗？

‘No fun for me. I haven’t had fun seeing you this time. I’m tired of you both, but it doesn’t show because you’re even more tired of me—you know what I mean. If I had any enthusiasm, I’d go on to new people.’
‘对我来说没有乐趣。这次见到你我不太高兴。我厌倦了你们俩，但这并没有表现出来，因为你们更厌倦了我——你知道我的意思。如果我有任何热情，我就会去结识新朋友。

There was a rough nap on Nicole’s velvet gloves as she slapped him back:
当妮可回击他时，他的天鹅绒手套上有一阵粗暴的打盹：

‘Seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, Abe. Anyhow you don’t mean that. I can’t see why you’ve given up about everything.’
“让人不愉快似乎很愚蠢，阿部。反正你不是这个意思。我不明白你为什么放弃一切。

Abe considered, trying hard not to cough or blow his nose.
安倍思考着，努力不咳嗽或擤鼻涕。

‘I suppose I got bored; and then it was such a long way to go back in order to get anywhere.’
“我想我很无聊；然后要回去要走很长的路才能到达任何地方。

Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman, but he can almost never bring it off when he feels most like a helpless child.
男人常常可以在女人面前扮演无助的孩子，但当他感觉自己像个无助的孩子时，他几乎永远无法做到这一点。

‘No excuse for it,’ Nicole said crisply.
“没有任何借口，”妮可干脆地说。

Abe was feeling worse every minute—he could think of nothing but disagreeable and sheerly nervous remarks. Nicole thought that the correct attitude for her was to sit staring straight ahead, hands in her lap. For a while there was no communication between them— each was racing away from the other, breathing only insofar as there was blue space ahead, a sky not seen by the other. Unlike lovers they possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they possessed no future; yet up to this morning Nicole had liked Abe better than any one except Dick—and he had been heavy, belly-frightened, with love for her for years.
安倍的感觉每分钟都在恶化——他除了令人不快和纯粹紧张的言论之外什么也想不起来。妮可认为对她来说正确的态度是坐着，眼睛直视前方，双手放在腿上。有一段时间，他们之间没有任何交流——每个人都在远离对方，只有在前方有蓝色的空间、对方看不到的天空时才呼吸。与恋人不同，他们没有过去；与夫妻不同，他们没有未来。然而直到今天早上，除了迪克之外，妮可比任何人都更喜欢阿贝——而他多年来一直很胖，肚子受惊，却对她充满了爱。

‘Tired of women’s worlds,’ he spoke up suddenly.
“厌倦了女人的世界。”他突然说道。

‘Then why don’t you make a world of your own?’
“那你为什么不创造一个属于你自己的世界呢？”

‘Tired of friends. The thing is to have sycophants.’
‘厌倦了朋友。问题是要有阿谀奉承者。

Nicole tried to force the minute hand around on the station clock, but, ‘You agree?’ he demanded.
尼科尔试图强行转动车站时钟上的分针，但是，“你同意吗？”他问道。

‘I am a woman and my business is to hold things together.’
“我是一名女性，我的职责就是把事情维系在一起。”

‘My business is to tear them apart.’
“我的任务就是把他们撕碎。”

‘When you get drunk you don’t tear anything apart except yourself,’ she said, cold now, and frightened and unconfident. The station was filling but no one she knew came. After a moment her eyes fell gratefully on a tall girl with straw hair like a helmet, who was dropping letters in the mail slot.
“当你喝醉的时候，除了你自己，你不会撕裂任何东西，”她说道，现在她的语气很冷，充满了恐惧和不自信。车站挤满了人，但她认识的人却没有来。过了一会儿，她的目光感激地落在一个身材高大、头发像头盔一样的女孩身上，她正在把信投进投递口。

‘A girl I have to speak to, Abe. Abe, wake up! You fool!’
“我必须和一个女孩说话，阿贝。安倍你醒醒吧！你个笨蛋！'

Patiently Abe followed her with his eyes. The woman turned in a startled way to greet Nicole, and Abe recognized her as some one he had seen around Paris. He took advantage of Nicole’s absence to cough hard and retchingly into his handkerchief, and to blow his nose loud. The morning was warmer and his underwear was soaked with sweat. His fingers trembled so violently that it took four matches to light a cigarette; it seemed absolutely necessary to make his way into the buffet for a drink, but immediately Nicole returned.
阿部耐心地用目光追随她。那女人惊讶地转身向妮可打招呼，安倍认出她是他在巴黎见过的某个人。他利用妮可不在的机会，用手帕捂着嘴，用力咳嗽，还大声擤鼻涕。早上天气暖和，他的内裤都被汗水浸湿了。他的手指颤抖得厉害，点燃一支烟需要四根火柴。看来他绝对有必要去自助餐厅喝一杯，但妮可立即回来了。

‘That was a mistake,’ she said with frosty humor. ‘After begging me to come and see her, she gave me a good snubbing. She looked at me as if I were rotted.’ Excited, she did a little laugh, as with two fingers high in the scales. ‘Let people come to you.’
“那是一个错误，”她冷冷幽默地说。 “在求我去看她之后，她却冷落了我。她看着我，好像我已经腐烂了。”她兴奋地笑了笑，仿佛两根手指高高地放在鳞片上。 “让人们来找你。”

Abe recovered from a cigarette cough and remarked:
安倍从香烟咳嗽中恢复过来，说道：

‘Trouble is when you’re sober you don’t want to see anybody, and when you’re tight nobody wants to see you.’
“问题是，当你清醒时，你不想见任何人，而当你紧张时，没人想见你。”

‘Who, me?’ Nicole laughed again; for some reason the late encounter had cheered her.
“谁，我？”妮可又笑了。出于某种原因，迟来的遭遇让她感到高兴。

‘No—me.’
“不——我。”

‘Speak for yourself. I like people, a lot of people—I like—‘
‘为你自己说话。我喜欢人，很多人——我喜欢——”

Rosemary and Mary North came in sight, walking slowly and searching for Abe, and Nicole burst forth grossly with ‘Hey! Hi! Hey!’ and laughed and waved the package of handkerchiefs she had bought for Abe.
罗斯玛丽和玛丽·诺斯出现在视线中，他们慢慢地走着，寻找阿贝，妮可粗声粗气地说：“嘿！”你好！嘿！”笑着挥舞着她给安倍买的手帕。

They stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted down by Abe’s gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness. All of them were conscious of the solemn dignity that flowed from him, of his achievement, fragmentary, suggestive and surpassed. But they were frightened at his survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.
他们站在一个令人不舒服的小团体中，被阿贝的巨大存在所压垮：他像一艘大帆船的残骸一样横在他们身上，用他的存在来控制他自己的软弱和自我放纵，他的狭隘和痛苦。他们所有人都意识到他身上散发出的庄严尊严，他的成就，零碎的、暗示性的和超越的。但他们对他的生存意志感到恐惧，曾经是求生的意志，现在变成了求死的意志。

Dick Diver came and brought with him a fine glowing surface on which the three women sprang like monkeys with cries of relief, perching on his shoulders, on the beautiful crown of his hat or the gold head of his cane. Now, for a moment, they could disregard the spectacle of Abe’s gigantic obscenity. Dick saw the situation quickly and grasped it quietly. He pulled them out of themselves into the station, making plain its wonders. Nearby, some Americans were saying good-by in voices that mimicked the cadence of water running into a large old bathtub. Standing in the station, with Paris in back of them, it seemed as if they were vicariously leaning a little over the ocean, already undergoing a sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the essential molecule of a new people.
迪克·戴弗带来了一块精美的发光表面，三个女人像猴子一样跳了起来，发出如释重负的叫声，栖息在他的肩膀上、美丽的帽子冠上或手杖的金色头上。现在，他们可以暂时忽视安倍的巨大淫秽场面。迪克很快就看到了情况，静静地掌握了。他把他们从自己的世界中拉出来，带入空间站，向人们展示空间站的奇迹。在附近，一些美国人正在告别，声音模仿着水流入一个大旧浴缸的节奏。站在车站里，巴黎在他们身后，他们似乎正在间接地倾斜在海洋之上，已经经历了巨大的变化，原子的移动形成了新民族的基本分子。

So the well-to-do Americans poured through the station onto the platforms with frank new faces, intelligent, considerate, thoughtless, thought-for. An occasional English face among them seemed sharp and emergent. When there were enough Americans on the platform the first impression of their immaculacy and their money began to fade into a vague racial dusk that hindered and blinded both them and their observers.
因此，富裕的美国人带着坦率的新面孔涌入车站，聪明、体贴、轻率、深思熟虑。他们中间偶尔出现一张英国面孔，显得犀利而突兀。当平台上有足够多的美国人时，他们的完美和金钱的第一印象开始褪色为模糊的种族黄昏，阻碍和蒙蔽了他们和他们的观察者。

Nicole seized Dick’s arm crying, ‘Look!’ Dick turned in time to see what took place in half a minute. At a Pullman entrance two cars off, a vivid scene detached itself from the tenor of many farewells. The young woman with the helmet-like hair to whom Nicole had spoken made an odd dodging little run away from the man to whom she was talking and plunged a frantic hand into her purse; then the sound of two revolver shots cracked the narrow air of the platform. Simultaneously the engine whistled sharply and the train began to move, momentarily dwarfing the shots in significance. Abe waved again from his window, oblivious to what had happened. But before the crowd closed in, the others had seen the shots take effect, seen the target sit down upon the platform.
妮可抓住迪克的手臂哭道：“看！”迪克及时转过身来，看看半分钟后发生了什么。在距离两辆车相距的普尔曼入口处，一幅生动的场景与许多告别的基调截然不同。与妮可交谈的那位有着头盔般头发的年轻女子奇怪地躲开了与她交谈的男人，并疯狂地把手伸进了钱包里。然后两声左轮手枪的射击声打破了平台狭窄的空气。与此同时，引擎发出尖锐的呼啸声，火车开始移动，瞬间使镜头的意义相形见绌。阿贝再次从窗外挥手，对发生的事情一无所知。但在人群围拢之前，其他人已经看到射击生效，看到目标坐在了平台上。

Only after a hundred years did the train stop; Nicole, Mary, and Rosemary waited on the outskirts while Dick fought his way through. It was five minutes before he found them again—by this time the crowd had split into two sections, following, respectively, the man on a stretcher and the girl walking pale and firm between distraught gendarmes.
一百年后，火车才停下来；妮可、玛丽和罗斯玛丽在郊区等待，而迪克则奋力冲了过去。过了五分钟，他才再次找到他们——这时人群已经分成两部分，分别跟在担架上的男人和面色苍白、坚定地走在心烦意乱的宪兵中间的女孩后面。

‘It was Maria Wallis,’ Dick said hurriedly. ‘The man she shot was an Englishman—they had an awful time finding out who, because she shot him through his identification card.’ They were walking quickly from the train, swayed along with the crowd. ‘I found out what poste de police they’re taking her to so I’ll go there—‘
“是玛丽亚·沃利斯，”迪克急忙说道。 “她射杀的那个人是一个英国人——他们花了很长时间才找到是谁，因为她是通过他的身份证射杀他的。”他们从火车上快步走出来，随着人群摇摇晃晃。 “我知道他们要带她去哪个警察局，所以我会去那里——”

‘But her sister lives in Paris,’ Nicole objected. ‘Why not phone her? Seems very peculiar nobody thought of that. She’s married to a Frenchman, and he can do more than we can.’
“但她姐姐住在巴黎，”妮可反对道。 ‘为什么不给她打电话？似乎很奇怪，没有人想到这一点。她嫁给了一个法国人，他能做的比我们多。”

Dick hesitated, shook his head and started off.
迪克犹豫了一下，摇摇头，开始了。

‘Wait!’ Nicole cried after him. ‘That’s foolish—how can you do any good—with your French?’
“等等！”妮可在他身后喊道。 “这太愚蠢了——你的法语能做什么用处呢？”

‘At least I’ll see they don’t do anything outrageous to her.’
“至少我会确保他们不会对她做任何令人发指的事情。”

‘They’re certainly going to hold on to her,’ Nicole assured him briskly. ‘She DID shoot the man. The best thing is to phone right away to Laura—she can do more than we can.’
“他们肯定会抓住她的，”妮可轻快地向他保证。 “她确实开枪打死了那个男人。最好的办法是立即打电话给劳拉——她能做的比我们多。

Dick was unconvinced—also he was showing off for Rosemary.
迪克不相信——而且他也是在向罗斯玛丽炫耀。

‘You wait,’ said Nicole firmly, and hurried off to a telephone booth.
“你等着，”妮可坚定地说，然后快步走向电话亭。

‘When Nicole takes things into her hands,’ he said with affectionate irony, ‘there is nothing more to be done.’
“当妮可把事情交到她手中时，”他充满深情讽刺地说，“就没有什么可做的了。”

He saw Rosemary for the first time that morning. They exchanged glances, trying to recognize the emotions of the day before. For a moment each seemed unreal to the other—then the slow warm hum of love began again.
那天早上他第一次见到罗斯玛丽。他们交换了眼神，试图辨认出前一天的情绪。有一瞬间，彼此都显得不真实——然后，爱的缓慢温暖的嗡嗡声再次开始。

‘You like to help everybody, don’t you?’ Rosemary said.
“你喜欢帮助每个人，不是吗？”罗斯玛丽说。

‘I only pretend to.’
“我只是假装这么做。”

‘Mother likes to help everybody—of course she can’t help as many people as you do.’ She sighed. ‘Sometimes I think I’m the most selfish person in the world.’
“妈妈喜欢帮助每个人——当然她不能像你那样帮助那么多人。”她叹了口气。 “有时候我觉得我是世界上最自私的人。”

For the first time the mention of her mother annoyed rather than amused Dick. He wanted to sweep away her mother, remove the whole affair from the nursery footing upon which Rosemary persistently established it. But he realized that this impulse was a loss of control—what would become of Rosemary’s urge toward him if, for even a moment, he relaxed. He saw, not without panic, that the affair was sliding to rest; it could not stand still, it must go on or go back; for the first time it occurred to him that Rosemary had her hand on the lever more authoritatively than he.
第一次提到她母亲，迪克不但没有感到好笑，反而感到恼火。他想扫除她的母亲，将整个事件从罗斯玛丽坚持建立的托儿所基础上移除。但他意识到这种冲动是一种失控——如果他放松哪怕是片刻，罗斯玛丽对他的冲动会变成什么样子。他不无惊慌地看到这件事正在逐渐平息。它不能停滞不前，它必须继续前进或后退；他第一次想到，罗斯玛丽比他更有权威地把手放在操纵杆上。

Before he had thought out a course of procedure, Nicole returned.
还没等他想好办法，妮可就回来了。

‘I found Laura. It was the first news she had and her voice kept fading away and then getting loud again—as if she was fainting and then pulling herself together. She said she knew something was going to happen this morning.’
“我找到了劳拉。这是她得到的第一个消息，她的声音不断减弱，然后又变大——就好像她昏倒了然后又振作起来。她说她知道今天早上会发生一些事情。

‘Maria ought to be with Diaghileff,’ said Dick in a gentle tone, in order to bring them back to quietude. ‘She has a nice sense of decor—not to say rhythm. Will any of us ever see a train pulling out without hearing a few shots?’
“玛丽亚应该和迪亚吉列夫在一起，”迪克用温和的语气说道，以便让他们恢复安静。 “她对装饰有很好的感觉——更不用说节奏了。我们中的任何人都会看到火车驶出而没有听到几声枪响吗？

They bumped down the wide steel steps. ‘I’m sorry for the poor man,’ Nicole said. ‘Course that’s why she talked so strange to me— she was getting ready to open fire.’
他们跌跌撞撞地走下宽阔的钢台阶。 “我为这个可怜的人感到抱歉，”妮可说。 “当然，这就是为什么她对我说话如此奇怪——她正准备开火。”

She laughed, Rosemary laughed too, but they were both horrified, and both of them deeply wanted Dick to make a moral comment on the matter and not leave it to them. This wish was not entirely conscious, especially on the part of Rosemary, who was accustomed to having shell fragments of such events shriek past her head. But a totality of shock had piled up in her too. For the moment, Dick was too shaken by the impetus of his newly recognized emotion to resolve things into the pattern of the holiday, so the women, missing something, lapsed into a vague unhappiness.
她笑了，罗斯玛丽也笑了，但他们都被吓坏了，两人都深深地希望迪克对此事做出道德评论，而不是把它留给他们。这个愿望并不是完全有意识的，尤其是对罗斯玛丽来说，她已经习惯了此类事件的炮弹碎片从她的头顶尖叫着。但她内心也充满了震惊。此刻，迪克被他新认识的情感冲动所震撼，无法将事情按照节日的模式解决，因此女人们错过了一些东西，陷入了一种模糊的不快乐之中。

Then, as if nothing had happened, the lives of the Divers and their friends flowed out into the street.
然后，就像什么都没发生一样，戴弗夫妇和他们的朋友们的生命就流到了街上。

However, everything had happened—Abe’s departure and Mary’s impending departure for Salzburg this afternoon had ended the time in Paris. Or perhaps the shots, the concussions that had finished God knew what dark matter, had terminated it. The shots had entered into all their lives: echoes of violence followed them out onto the pavement where two porters held a post-mortem beside them as they waited for a taxi.
然而，一切都已经发生了——安倍的离开和玛丽今天下午即将启程前往萨尔茨堡，结束了在巴黎的时光。或者也许那些枪击、脑震荡已经结束了天知道是什么暗物质，已经终止了它。这些枪声进入了他们的生活：暴力的回声跟随他们来到人行道上，当他们等待出租车时，两名搬运工在他们旁边进行尸检。

‘Tu as vu le revolver? Il était très petit, vraie perle—un jouet.’
‘Tu as vu le 左轮手枪？ Il était très petit, vraie perle—un jouet。

‘Mais, assez puissant!’ said the other porter sagely. ‘Tu as vu sa chemise? Assez de sang pour se croire à la guerre.’
“Mais，assez puissant！”另一个搬运工睿智地说。 “你是你的衬衣吗？” Assez de sang pour se croire à la guerre。

XX

In the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline exhaust cooked slowly in the July sun. It was a terrible thing— unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape but suggested only roads choked with the same foul asthma. During their luncheon, outdoors, across from the Luxembourg Gardens, Rosemary had cramps and felt fretful and full of impatient lassitude—it was the foretaste of this that had inspired her self-accusation of selfishness in the station.
当他们出来时，广场上悬浮着一团汽油废气，在七月的阳光下慢慢煮熟。这是一件可怕的事情——与纯粹的炎热不同，它并没有带来乡村逃离的希望，而只表明道路被同样的恶臭堵塞。午饭时，在卢森堡花园对面的户外，罗斯玛丽感到痉挛、焦躁不安，充满了不耐烦的倦怠——正是这种预尝激发了她在车站自责自私。

Dick had no suspicion of the sharpness of the change; he was profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of egotism tended momentarily to blind him to what was going on round about him, and deprive him of the long ground-swell of imagination that he counted on for his judgments.
迪克对这种变化的剧烈程度毫不怀疑。他非常不高兴，而随之而来的自我中心主义的增加往往使他暂时对周围发生的事情视而不见，并剥夺了他长期依赖的想象力来做出判断。

After Mary North left them, accompanied by the Italian singing teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking her to her train, Rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an engagement at her studio: ‘meet some officials.’
玛丽·诺斯在与他们一起喝咖啡并送她上火车的意大利歌唱老师的陪伴下离开了他们，罗斯玛丽也站了起来，前往她的工作室参加一个约会：“会见一些官员。”

‘And oh—‘ she proposed ‘—if Collis Clay, that Southern boy—if he comes while you are still sitting here, just tell him I couldn’t wait; tell him to call me to-morrow.’
“哦——”她提议道，“如果科利斯·克莱，那个南方男孩——如果你还坐在这里的时候他来了，就告诉他我等不及了；如果他来了，你就告诉他我已经等不及了。”告诉他明天给我打电话。”

Too insouciant, in reaction from the late disturbance, she had assumed the privileges of a child—the result being to remind the Divers of their exclusive love for their own children; Rosemary was sharply rebuked in a short passage between the women: ‘You’d better leave the message with a waiter,’ Nicole’s voice was stern and unmodulated, ‘we’re leaving immediately.’
由于对最近的骚乱的反应，她过于漫不经心地承担了孩子的特权，结果是提醒戴弗夫妇他们对自己孩子的专一爱；罗斯玛丽在女人们之间的一段短短的通道里遭到了尖锐的斥责：“你最好给服务员留言，”妮可的声音严厉而自然，“我们马上就走。”

Rosemary got it, took it without resentment.
罗斯玛丽得到了，毫无怨恨地接受了。

‘I’ll let it go then. Good-by, you darlings.’
‘那我就放手了。再见，亲爱的。

Dick asked for the check; the Divers relaxed, chewing tentatively on toothpicks.
迪克要了支票；潜水员们放松下来，试探性地嚼着牙签。

‘Well—‘ they said together.
“嗯——”他们一起说。

He saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that only he would have noticed, and he could pretend not to have seen. What did Nicole think? Rosemary was one of a dozen people he had ‘worked over’ in the past years: these had included a French circus clown, Abe and Mary North, a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter, a comedienne from the Grand Guignol, a half-crazy pederast from the Russian Ballet, a promising tenor they had staked to a year in Milan. Nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his interest and enthusiasm; but she realized also that, except while their children were being born, Dick had not spent a night apart from her since their marriage. On the other hand, there was a pleasingness about him that simply had to be used—those who possessed that pleasingness had to keep their hands in, and go along attaching people that they had no use to make of.
他看到她嘴角闪过一丝不悦，短暂得只有他能注意到，他也可以假装没有看到。妮可怎么想？过去几年里，罗斯玛丽是他“工作过”的十几个人之一：其中包括一位法国马戏团小丑、阿贝和玛丽·诺斯、一对舞者、一位作家、一位画家、一位来自大吉尼奥尔剧院的喜剧演员、一位来自俄罗斯芭蕾舞团的半疯狂的鸡奸者，他们在米兰与一位有前途的男高音赌注了一年。妮可很清楚这些人是多么认真地理解他的兴趣和热情。但她也意识到，自从他们结婚以来，除了孩子出生的时候，迪克没有和她分开过一夜。另一方面，他身上有一种令人愉悦的感觉，只是需要被利用——那些拥有这种愉悦感的人必须把手伸进去，去附和那些他们没有用处的人。

Now Dick hardened himself and let minutes pass without making any gesture of confidence, any representation of constantly renewed surprise that they were one together.
现在迪克变得坚强起来，几分钟过去了，没有做出任何自信的动作，也没有表现出对他们在一起的不断更新的惊讶。

Collis Clay out of the South edged a passage between the closely packed tables and greeted the Divers cavalierly. Such salutations always astonished Dick—acquaintances saying ‘Hi!’ to them, or speaking only to one of them. He felt so intensely about people that in moments of apathy he preferred to remain concealed; that one could parade a casualness into his presence was a challenge to the key on which he lived.
来自南方的科利斯·克莱（Collis Clay）在拥挤的桌子之间挤过一条通道，傲慢地向潜水员们打招呼。这样的问候总是让迪克感到惊讶——熟人向他们打招呼，或者只和其中一个人说话。他对人的感情如此强烈，以至于在冷漠的时刻他宁愿隐藏起来。人们可以在他面前表现出一种随意，这是对他赖以生存的关键的挑战。

Collis, unaware that he was without a wedding garment, heralded his arrival with: ‘I reckon I’m late—the beyed has flown.’ Dick had to wrench something out of himself before he could forgive him for not having first complimented Nicole.
科利斯没有意识到自己没有穿婚纱，他在迎接自己到来时说道：“我想我迟到了——大眼已经飞走了。”迪克必须先从自己身上抽出一些东西，然后才能原谅他没有先恭维妮可。

She left almost immediately and he sat with Collis, finishing the last of his wine. He rather liked Collis—he was ‘post-war”; less difficult than most of the Southerners he had known at New Haven a decade previously. Dick listened with amusement to the conversation that accompanied the slow, profound stuffing of a pipe. In the early afternoon children and nurses were trekking into the Luxembourg Gardens; it was the first time in months that Dick had let this part of the day out of his hands.
她几乎立刻就离开了，他和科利斯坐在一起，喝完最后一杯酒。他更喜欢科利斯——他是“战后”的人；比十年前他在纽黑文认识的大多数南方人要容易相处。迪克饶有兴趣地听着伴随着缓慢而深刻的烟斗演奏的谈话。下午早些时候，孩子们和护士们徒步进入卢森堡花园。这是几个月来迪克第一次把这一天的时间从他的掌控之中。

Suddenly his blood ran cold as he realized the content of Collis’s confidential monologue.
当他意识到科利斯的秘密独白的内容时，他的血液突然变冷了。

‘—she’s not so cold as you’d probably think. I admit I thought she was cold for a long time. But she got into a jam with a friend of mine going from New York to Chicago at Easter—a boy named Hillis she thought was pretty nutsey at New Haven—she had a compartment with a cousin of mine but she and Hillis wanted to be alone, so in the afternoon my cousin came and played cards in our compartment. Well, after about two hours we went back and there was Rosemary and Bill Hillis standing in the vestibule arguing with the conductor—Rosemary white as a sheet. Seems they locked the door and pulled down the blinds and I guess there was some heavy stuff going on when the conductor came for the tickets and knocked on the door. They thought it was us kidding them and wouldn’t let him in at first, and when they did, he was plenty sore. He asked Hillis if that was his compartment and whether he and Rosemary were married that they locked the door, and Hillis lost his temper trying to explain there was nothing wrong. He said the conductor had insulted Rosemary and he wanted him to fight, but that conductor could have made trouble—and believe me I had an awful time smoothing it over.’
“——她并不像你想象的那么冷。我承认我很长一段时间都觉得她冷淡。但她在复活节时和我的一个朋友从纽约飞往芝加哥时遇到了麻烦——一个名叫希利斯的男孩，她认为在纽黑文很疯狂——她和我的一个表弟同住一个车厢，但她和希利斯想独处。于是，下午表弟就来我们包厢打牌了。好吧，大约两个小时后，我们回去了，罗斯玛丽和比尔希利斯站在前厅里与售票员争论——罗斯玛丽脸色苍白。看来他们锁上了门，拉下了百叶窗，我猜当售票员来取票并敲门时，发生了一些沉重的事情。他们以为我们在开玩笑，一开始就不让他进来，当他们让他进来时，他感到非常疼痛。他问希利斯那是不是他的隔间，以及他和罗斯玛丽是否结婚了，然后他们锁上了门，希利斯大发脾气，试图解释没有什么问题。他说售票员侮辱了罗斯玛丽，他希望他打架，但售票员可能会制造麻烦——相信我，我花了很长时间才平息这件事。

With every detail imagined, with even envy for the pair’s community of misfortune in the vestibule, Dick felt a change taking place within him. Only the image of a third person, even a vanished one, entering into his relation with Rosemary was needed to throw him off his balance and send through him waves of pain, misery, desire, desperation. The vividly pictured hand on Rosemary’s cheek, the quicker breath, the white excitement of the event viewed from outside, the inviolable secret warmth within.
想象着每一个细节，甚至羡慕这对在前厅里的不幸社区，迪克感到自己内心正在发生变化。只要第三者的形象，即使是消失的人，进入他与罗斯玛丽的关系，他就会失去平衡，并给他带来一波又一波的痛苦、不幸、欲望和绝望。生动地描绘了罗斯玛丽脸颊上的手，呼吸加快，从外面看到的事件的白色兴奋，内心不可侵犯的秘密温暖。

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?
——你介意我把窗帘拉下来吗？

—Please do. It’s too light in here.
——请这样做。这里太亮了。

Collis Clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at New Haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis. Dick had gathered that he was in love with Rosemary in some curious way Dick could not have understood. The affair with Hillis seemed to have made no emotional impression on Collis save to give him the joyful conviction that Rosemary was ‘human.’
科利斯·克莱现在正在以同样的语气、同样的重点谈论纽黑文的兄弟会政治。迪克推测他以一种迪克无法理解的奇怪方式爱上了罗斯玛丽。与希利斯的风流韵事似乎没有给科利斯留下任何情感印象，只是让他愉快地相信罗斯玛丽是“人类”。

‘Bones got a wonderful crowd,’ he said. ‘We all did, as a matter of fact. New Haven’s so big now the sad thing is the men we have to leave out.’
“骨头乐队有很多观众，”他说。 “事实上，我们都这么做了。纽黑文现在这么​​大了，可悲的是我们不得不把这些人排除在外。

... Dick went over Paris to his bank—writing a check, he looked along the row of men at the desks deciding to which one he would present it for an O.K. As he wrote he engrossed himself in the material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk. Once he raised glazed eyes to look toward the mail department, then glazed his spirit again by concentration upon the objects he dealt with.
……迪克越过巴黎来到他的银行——写了一张支票，他看着办公桌前的一排人，决定把支票交给哪一个，以获得同意。当他写作时，他全神贯注于物质活动，仔细检查钢笔，在高高的玻璃顶桌子上费力地写字。有一次，他抬起呆滞的眼睛看向邮局，然后他的精神又因为专注于他所处理的物品而变得呆滞。

Still he failed to decide to whom the check should be presented, which man in the line would guess least of the unhappy predicament in which he found himself and, also, which one would be least likely to talk. There was Perrin, the suave New Yorker, who had asked him to luncheons at the American Club, there was Casasus, the Spaniard, with whom he usually discussed a mutual friend in spite of the fact that the friend had passed out of his life a dozen years before; there was Muchhause, who always asked him whether he wanted to draw upon his wife’s money or his own.
尽管如此，他还是没能决定支票应该交给谁，队列中哪一个人最不可能猜到他所面临的不幸困境，以及哪一个人最不可能开口说话。有佩兰，这位温文尔雅的纽约人，曾邀请他去美国俱乐部吃午餐；还有卡萨苏斯，西班牙人，他经常与他讨论一个共同的朋友，尽管事实上这个朋友已经从他的生活中消失了。十几年前；穆豪斯总是问他是想动用妻子的钱还是自己的钱。

As he entered the amount on the stub, and drew two lines under it, he decided to go to Pierce, who was young and for whom he would have to put on only a small show. It was often easier to give a show than to watch one.
当他在存根上输入金额并在下面画两条线时，他决定去找皮尔斯，他很年轻，他只需要为他上演一场小表演。举办一场演出往往比观看一场演出更容易。

He went to the mail desk first—as the woman who served him pushed up with her bosom a piece of paper that had nearly escaped the desk, he thought how differently women use their bodies from men. He took his letters aside to open: There was a bill for seventeen psychiatric books from a German concern, a bill from Brentano’s, a letter from Buffalo from his father, in a handwriting that year by year became more indecipherable; there was a card from Tommy Barban postmarked Fez and bearing a facetious communication; there were letters from doctors in Zurich, both in German; a disputed bill from a plasterer in Cannes; a bill from a furniture maker; a letter from the publisher of a medical journal in Baltimore, miscellaneous announcements and an invitation to a showing of pictures by an incipient artist; also there were three letters for Nicole, and a letter for Rosemary sent in his care.
他先去了邮局——当为他服务的女士用怀里推起一张几乎从办公桌上掉下来的纸时，他想到了女人对自己身体的使用与男人有多么不同。他把信放在一边打开：有一份来自德国一家公司的十七本精神病学书籍的账单，一份来自布伦塔诺的账单，一封来自布法罗的他父亲的信，信的笔迹一年比一年变得更加难以辨认。有一张汤米·巴班寄来的卡片，邮戳是非斯，上面写着一些滑稽的内容；还有苏黎世医生的来信，都是德文的；戛纳一位泥水匠提出的有争议的账单；家具制造商的账单；巴尔的摩一家医学杂志出版商的一封信、各种公告以及一位新晋艺术家的画作展示邀请函；还有三封写给妮可的信和一封写给罗斯玛丽的信，由他转交。

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?
——你介意我把窗帘拉下来吗？

He went toward Pierce but he was engaged with a woman, and Dick saw with his heels that he would have to present his check to Casasus at the next desk, who was free.
他走向皮尔斯，但他正在和一个女人订婚，迪克用脚后跟看到他必须将支票交给隔壁办公桌上的卡萨苏斯，而卡萨苏斯有空。

‘How are you, Diver?’ Casasus was genial. He stood up, his mustache spreading with his smile. ‘We were talking about Featherstone the other day and I thought of you—he’s out in California now.’
“你好吗，潜水员？”卡萨苏斯很和蔼可亲。他站了起来，脸上的小胡子因微笑而散开。 “前几天我们在谈论费瑟斯通，我想到了你——他现在在加利福尼亚。”

Dick widened his eyes and bent forward a little.
迪克睁大眼睛，身体向前倾了一点。

‘In Cali-FOR-nia?’
'在加利福尼亚？'

‘That’s what I heard.’
“这就是我听到的。”

Dick held the check poised; to focus the attention of Casasus upon it he looked toward Pierce’s desk, holding the latter for a moment in a friendly eye-play conditioned by an old joke of three years before when Pierce had been involved with a Lithuanian countess. Pierce played up with a grin until Casasus had authorized the check and had no further recourse to detain Dick, whom he liked, than to stand up holding his pince-nez and repeat, ‘Yes, he’s in California.’
迪克稳稳地拿着支票。为了吸引卡萨苏斯的注意力，他看向皮尔斯的办公桌，友好地与后者对视了一会儿，这是三年前皮尔斯与一位立陶宛伯爵夫人有染时的一个老笑话。皮尔斯一直微笑着，直到卡萨苏斯批准了检查，他没有进一步的手段来拘留他喜欢的迪克，而是站起来拿着夹鼻眼镜重复道：“是的，他在加利福尼亚。”

Meanwhile Dick had seen that Perrin, at the head of the line of desks, was in conversation with the heavyweight champion of the world; from a sidesweep of Perrin’s eye Dick saw that he was considering calling him over and introducing him, but that he finally decided against it.
与此同时，迪克看到坐在办公桌前头的佩兰正在与世界重量级冠军交谈。迪克从佩林的眼神中看出他正在考虑把他叫过来并介绍给他，但他最终决定不这么做。

Cutting across the social mood of Casasus with the intensity he had accumulated at the glass desk—which is to say he looked hard at the check, studying it, and then fixed his eyes on grave problems beyond the first marble pillar to the right of the banker’s head and made a business of shifting the cane, hat, and letters he carried—he said good-by and went out. He had long ago purchased the doorman; his taxi sprang to the curb.
卡萨苏斯的社交情绪与他在玻璃办公桌前积累的紧张情绪格格不入——也就是说，他仔细地看着支票，研究它，然后将目光集中在办公桌右侧第一根大理石柱之外的严重问题上。银行家的头，并以转移他携带的手杖、帽子和信件为业——他告别了，出去了。他很久以前就买下了门卫；他的出租车冲到了路边。

‘I want to go to the Films Par Excellence Studio—it’s on a little street in Passy. Go to the Muette. I’ll direct you from there.’
“我想去卓越电​​影工作室——它位于帕西的一条小街上。去穆埃特吧。我会从那里引导你。

He was rendered so uncertain by the events of the last forty-eight hours that he was not even sure of what he wanted to do; he paid off the taxi at the Muette and walked in the direction of the studio, crossing to the opposite side of the street before he came to the building. Dignified in his fine clothes, with their fine accessories, he was yet swayed and driven as an animal. Dignity could come only with an overthrowing of his past, of the effort of the last six years. He went briskly around the block with the fatuousness of one of Tarkington’s adolescents, hurrying at the blind places lest he miss Rosemary’s coming out of the studio. It was a melancholy neighborhood. Next door to the place he saw a sign: ‘1000 chemises.’ The shirts filled the window, piled, cravated, stuffed, or draped with shoddy grace on the showcase floor: ‘1000 chemises’—count them! On either side he read: ‘Papeterie,’ ‘Pâtisserie,’ ‘Solde,’ ‘Réclame’—and Constance Talmadge in ‘Déjeuner de Soleil,’ and farther away there were more sombre announcements: ‘Vêtements Ecclésiastiques,’ ‘Déclaration de Décès’ and ‘Pompes Funèbres.’ Life and death.
过去四十八小时发生的事情让他变得如此不确定，以至于他甚至不知道自己想做什么；他在Muette付了出租车费，朝工作室的方向走去，穿过街道的对面，来到了大楼前。他穿着华丽的衣服，佩戴精美的配饰，显得威严，但他却像动物一样摇摆和驱使。只有推翻他的过去，推翻过去六年的努力，才能获得尊严。他像塔金顿的青少年一样轻快地在街区里走来走去，在盲点处匆匆忙忙，以免错过从工作室出来的罗斯玛丽。这是一个忧郁的街区。他在那个地方的隔壁看到了一个牌子：“1000 件衬衣。”橱窗里摆满了衬衫，堆放着、缝着、塞满了，或者以劣质的优雅挂在陈列柜的地板上：“1000 件衬衣”——数一数！他在两边写着：“Papeterie”、“Pâtisserie”、“Solde”、“Réclame”——以及《Déjeuner de Soleil》中的康斯坦斯·塔尔梅奇，更远的地方有更多阴沉的公告：“Vêtements Ecclésiastiques”、“Déclaration de Décès” ”和“Pompes Funèbres。”生与死。

He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in his life—it was out of line with everything that had preceded it—even out of line with what effect he might hope to produce upon Rosemary. Rosemary saw him always as a model of correctness—his presence walking around this block was an intrusion. But Dick’s necessity of behaving as he did was a projection of some submerged reality: he was compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirtsleeve fitting his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirtsleeve like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his neck, his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small briefcase like a dandy—just as another man once found it necessary to stand in front of a church in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes. Dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten, unshriven, unexpurgated.
他知道他现在所做的事情标志着他生命中的一个转折点——这与之前的一切都格格不入——甚至与他希望对罗斯玛丽产生的影响格格不入。罗斯玛丽始终将他视为正确的典范——他在这个街区走来走去是一种入侵。但迪克的行为必然是某种隐藏的现实的投射：他被迫走到那里，或者站在那里，他的衬衫袖子贴合他的手腕，他的外套袖子像袖阀一样包裹着他的衬衫袖子，他的衣领与他的衣领模制在一起。他的红发剪得一模一样，手里拿着小公文包，像个花花公子一样——就像另一个男人曾经发现有必要穿着麻布和灰烬站在费拉拉的一座教堂前一样。迪克是在向那些未被遗忘、未被废除、未被清除的事物致敬。

二十一

After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact. It was just the sort of thing that was likely to happen to him when he was in the mood of not wanting to see any one. So rigidly did he sometimes guard his exposed self-consciousness that frequently he defeated his own purposes; as an actor who underplays a part sets up a craning forward, a stimulated emotional attention in an audience, and seems to create in others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open. Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our pity—we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us exercise the abstract function of pity.
站了三刻钟之后，他突然开始与人接触。当他不想见任何人的时候，这种事情就很可能发生在他身上。有时，他过于严格地保护自己暴露的自我意识，以至于常常挫败自己的目的。作为一个演员，如果一个角色演得不够充分，就会向前伸长脖子，激发观众的情感注意力，并似乎在其他人身上创造了一种能力，以弥合他留下的空白。同样，我们很少为那些需要并渴望我们怜悯的人感到难过——我们为那些通过其他方式让我们行使怜悯的抽象功能的人保留这种怜悯。

So Dick might, himself, have analyzed the incident that ensued. As he paced the Rue des Saintes-Anges he was spoken to by a thin-faced American, perhaps thirty, with an air of being scarred and a slight but sinister smile. As Dick gave him the light he requested, he placed him as one of a type of which he had been conscious since early youth—a type that loafed about tobacco stores with one elbow on the counter and watched, through heaven knew what small chink of the mind, the people who came in and out. Intimate to garages, where he had vague business conducted in undertones, to barber shops, to the lobbies of theatres—in such places, at any rate, Dick placed him. Sometimes the face bobbed up in one of Tad’s more savage cartoons—in boyhood Dick had often thrown an uneasy glance at the dim borderland of crime on which he stood.
所以迪克本人可能已经分析了随后发生的事件。当他在圣天使街踱步时，一个瘦脸的美国人跟他说话，大约三十岁，脸上带着伤痕累累的神情，脸上挂着淡淡但阴险的微笑。当迪克给了他他所要求的光明时，他将他视为他从年轻时就意识到的那种人——一种手肘支在柜台上在烟草店里闲逛的人，天知道天知道有什么小缝隙。头脑，进出的人。靠近车库，在那里他低声进行模糊的生意，靠近理发店，靠近剧院的大厅——无论如何，迪克把他安置在这些地方。有时，这张脸会出现在泰德的一部更为野蛮的漫画中——童年时，迪克经常不安地瞥一眼他所站在的昏暗的犯罪边缘。

‘How do you like Paris, Buddy?’
“你喜欢巴黎吗，伙计？”

Not waiting for an answer the man tried to fit in his footsteps with Dick’s: ‘Where you from?’ he asked encouragingly.
不等他回答，那人就试图跟上迪克的脚步：“你来自哪里？”他鼓励地问道。

‘From Buffalo.’
“来自布法罗。”

‘I’m from San Antone—but I been over here since the war.’
“我来自圣安东——但自从战争以来我就一直在这里。”

‘You in the army?’
“你在军队吗？”

‘I’LL say I was. Eighty-fourth Division—ever heard of that outfit?’
“我会说我是。”第八十四师——听说过那支部队吗？

The man walked a little ahead of him and fixed him with eyes that were practically menacing.
男人走到他前面不远的地方，用几乎充满威胁的目光盯着他。

‘Staying in Paris awhile, Buddy? Or just passing through.’
“在巴黎待一段时间，伙计？”或者只是路过。’

‘Passing through.’
“路过。”

‘What hotel you staying at?’
“你住在哪家酒店？”

Dick had begun laughing to himself—the party had the intention of rifling his room that night. His thoughts were read apparently without self-consciousness.
迪克开始自嘲地笑起来——那天晚上，这群人打算洗劫他的房间。他的想法显然是在不自觉的情况下被解读出来的。

‘With a build like yours you oughtn’t to be afraid of me, Buddy. There’s a lot of bums around just laying for American tourists, but you needn’t be afraid of me.’
“像你这样的身材，你不应该害怕我，巴迪。周围有很多流浪汉只是为了美国游客，但你不必害怕我。

Becoming bored, Dick stopped walking: ‘I just wonder why you’ve got so much time to waste.’
迪克感到无聊，停下了脚步：“我只是想知道为什么你有这么多时间可以浪费。”

‘I’m in business here in Paris.’
“我在巴黎做生意。”

‘In what line?’
“在哪一行？”

‘Selling papers.’
“卖报纸。”

The contrast between the formidable manner and the mild profession was absurd—but the man amended it with:
令人敬畏的态度和温和的表白之间的对比是荒谬的——但那人修正了它：

‘Don’t worry; I made plenty money last year—ten or twenty francs for a Sunny Times that cost six.’
'不用担心;去年我赚了很多钱——十法郎或二十法郎买一辆六法郎的《阳光时报》。

He produced a newspaper clipping from a rusty wallet and passed it over to one who had become a fellow stroller—the cartoon showed a stream of Americans pouring from the gangplank of a liner freighted with gold.
他从生锈的钱包里拿出一张剪报，递给了一个同车的人——漫画上描绘了一群美国人从一艘满载黄金的班轮上涌出的情景。

‘Two hundred thousand—spending ten million a summer.’
“二十万——一个夏天花一千万。”

‘What you doing out here in Passy?’
“你在帕西做什么？”

His companion looked around cautiously. ‘Movies,’ he said darkly. ‘They got an American studio over there. And they need guys can speak English. I’m waiting for a break.’
他的同伴小心翼翼地环顾四周。 “电影。”他阴沉地说。 “他们在那里有一个美国工作室。他们需要会说英语的人。我正在等待休息。

Dick shook him off quickly and firmly.
迪克迅速而坚定地把他甩开。

It had become apparent that Rosemary either had escaped on one of his early circuits of the block or else had left before he came into the neighborhood; he went into the bistro on the corner, bought a lead disk and, squeezed in an alcove between the kitchen and the foul toilet, he called the Roi George. He recognized Cheyne-Stokes tendencies in his respiration—but like everything the symptom served only to turn him in toward his emotion. He gave the number of the hotel; then stood holding the phone and staring into the café; after a long while a strange little voice said hello.
很明显，罗斯玛丽要么是在他早先绕行的街区之一逃跑的，要么是在他进入附近之前就离开了。他走进街角的小酒馆，买了一张铅盘，然后挤在厨房和肮脏的厕所之间的一个壁龛里，给“乔治国王”打电话。他意识到自己的呼吸有潮式倾向——但就像所有的事情一样，这种症状只会让他转向自己的情绪。他给出了旅馆的电话号码；然后拿着电话站在那里，凝视着咖啡馆。过了好一会儿，一个奇怪的小声音打招呼。

‘This is Dick—I had to call you.’
“我是迪克——我不得不给你打电话。”

A pause from her—then bravely, and in key with his emotion: ‘I’m glad you did.’
她停顿了一下——然后勇敢地、与他的情感相一致：“我很高兴你这么做了。”

‘I came to meet you at your studio—I’m out in Passy across the way from it. I thought maybe we’d ride around through the Bois.’
“我来你的工作室见你——我在工作室对面的帕西。我想也许我们可以骑车穿过森林。

‘Oh, I only stayed there a minute! I’m so sorry.’ A silence.
“噢，我只在那里呆了一分钟！”我很抱歉。”一片沉默。

‘Rosemary.’
'迷迭香。'

‘Yes, Dick.’
“是的，迪克。”

‘Look, I’m in an extraordinary condition about you. When a child can disturb a middle-aged gent—things get difficult.’
‘你看，我对你的态度非同寻常。当一个孩子可以打扰一个中年绅士时，事情就变得困难了。

‘You’re not middle-aged, Dick—you’re the youngest person in the world.’
“你不是中年人，迪克——你是世界上最年轻的人。”

‘Rosemary?’ Silence while he stared at a shelf that held the humbler poisons of France—bottles of Otard, Rhum St. James, Marie Brizzard, Punch Orangeade, André Fernet Blanco, Cherry Rochet, and Armagnac.
“迷迭香？”他沉默地盯着一个架子，架子上放着法国的一些不起眼的毒药——奥塔酒、圣詹姆斯朗姆酒、玛丽·布里扎德、宾治橙汁、安德烈·费内特·布兰科、樱桃罗切特和雅马邑白兰地。

‘Are you alone?’
'你一个人吗？'

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?
——你介意我把窗帘拉下来吗？

‘Who do you think I’d be with?’
“你觉得我会和谁在一起？”

‘That’s the state I’m in. I’d like to be with you now.’
“这就是我现在的状态。我现在想和你在一起。”

Silence, then a sigh and an answer. ‘I wish you were with me now.’
沉默，然后是叹息和回答。 “我希望你现在就在我身边。”

There was the hotel room where she lay behind a telephone number, and little gusts of music wailed around her—
在酒店房间里，她躺在电话号码后面，一阵阵音乐在她周围呼啸而过——

“And two—for tea.
“还有两个——喝茶。

And me for you,
还有我为了你，

And you for me
还有你对我来说

Alow-own.’
允许自己。’

There was the remembered dust of powder over her tan—when he kissed her face it was damp around the corners of her hair; there was the flash of a white face under his own, the arc of a shoulder.
她晒黑的皮肤上还残留着记忆中的粉末——当他亲吻她的脸时，她的发角周围都是湿漉漉的。他的脸下面闪现出一张苍白的脸，肩膀的弧度。

‘It’s impossible,’ he said to himself. In a minute he was out in the street marching along toward the Muette, or away from it, his small brief-case still in his hand, his gold-headed stick held at a sword-like angle.
“这是不可能的，”他对自己说。不一会儿，他就出现在街上，大步走向穆埃特，或者远离它，他的小公文包仍然在他的手里，他的金头手杖呈剑般的角度。

Rosemary returned to her desk and finished a letter to her mother.
罗斯玛丽回到办公桌前，写完一封给母亲的信。

‘—I only saw him for a little while but I thought he was wonderful looking. I fell in love with him (Of course I Do Love Dick Best but you know what I mean). He really is going to direct the picture and is leaving immediately for Hollywood, and I think we ought to leave, too. Collis Clay has been here. I like him all right but have not seen much of him because of the Divers, who really are divine, about the Nicest People I ever Knew. I am feeling not very well to-day and am taking the Medicine, though see No need for it. I’m not even Going to Try to tell you All that’s Happened until I see YOU!!! So when you get this letter WIRE, WIRE, WIRE! Are you coming north or shall I come south with the Divers?’
“——我只见过他一会儿，但我觉得他看起来很漂亮。我爱上了他（当然我最喜欢迪克，但你知道我的意思）。他真的要导演这部电影并立即前往好莱坞，我认为我们也应该离开。科利斯·克莱来过这里。我确实喜欢他，但没怎么见过他，因为戴弗斯真的很神圣，是我认识的最好的人。我今天感觉不太舒服，正在服用药物，但我认为不需要。在我见到你之前，我什至不会尝试告诉你发生的一切！所以当你收到这封信时，WIRE，WIRE，WIRE！你是往北走还是我和潜水员一起往南走？

At six Dick called Nicole.
六点钟，迪克给妮可打了电话。

‘Have you any special plans?’ he asked. ‘Would you like to do something quiet—dinner at the hotel and then a play?’
“你有什么特别的计划吗？”他问道。 “你想做点安静的事情吗——在酒店吃晚饭，然后玩一玩？”

‘Would you? I’ll do whatever you want. I phoned Rosemary a while ago and she’s having dinner in her room. I think this upset all of us, don’t you?’
'你会？我会做任何你想做的事。不久前我给罗斯玛丽打电话，她正在房间里吃晚饭。我想这让我们所有人都感到不安，不是吗？

‘It didn’t upset me,’ he objected. ‘Darling, unless you’re physically tired let’s do something. Otherwise we’ll get south and spend a week wondering why we didn’t see Boucher. It’s better than brooding—‘
“这并没有让我感到不安，”他反对道。 “亲爱的，除非你身体累了，否则我们做点什么吧。”否则我们就会南下，花一周的时间思考为什么没有看到鲍彻。这比沉思要好——”

This was a blunder and Nicole took him up sharply.
这是一个错误，妮可严厉批评了他。

‘Brooding about what?’
“沉思什么？”

‘About Maria Wallis.’
“关于玛丽亚·沃利斯。”

She agreed to go to a play. It was a tradition between them that they should never be too tired for anything, and they found it made the days better on the whole and put the evenings more in order. When, inevitably, their spirits flagged they shifted the blame to the weariness and fatigue of others. Before they went out, as fine-looking a couple as could be found in Paris, they knocked softly at Rosemary’s door. There was no answer; judging that she was asleep they walked into a warm strident Paris night, snatching a vermouth and bitters in the shadow by Fouquet’s bar.
她同意去看戏。他们之间有一个传统，那就是永远不要太累而做任何事情，他们发现这让白天总体上变得更好，让晚上变得更有秩序。当他们不可避免地情绪低落时，他们就会将责任归咎于其他人的疲倦和疲倦。他们出去之前，轻轻地敲了敲罗斯玛丽的门，这对巴黎最漂亮的情侣。没有人回答。判断她已经睡着了，他们走进了巴黎温暖刺耳的夜晚，在福凯酒吧的阴影下抓起一杯苦艾酒和苦味酒。

二十二

Nicole awoke late, murmuring something back into her dream before she parted her long lashes tangled with sleep. Dick’s bed was empty—only after a minute did she realize that she had been awakened by a knock at their salon door.
妮可很晚才醒来，在梦中低声说了些什么，然后才分开睡意缠结的长睫毛。迪克的床是空的——过了一会儿，她才意识到自己是被沙龙门的敲门声吵醒的。

‘Entrez!’ she called, but there was no answer, and after a moment she slipped on a dressing-gown and went to open it. A sergent-deville confronted her courteously and stepped inside the door.
“安特雷兹！”她喊道，但没有回应，过了一会儿，她穿上晨衣，去打开它。一位德维尔中士礼貌地与她对峙，然后走进门。

‘Mr. Afghan North—he is here?’
'先生。阿富汗北部——他在这里？

‘What? No—he’s gone to America.’
'什么？不——他去了美国。”

‘When did he leave, Madame?’
“夫人，他什么时候走的？”

‘Yesterday morning.’
'昨天早上。'

He shook his head and waved his forefinger at her in a quicker rhythm.
他摇摇头，用更快的节奏向她挥动食指。

‘He was in Paris last night. He is registered here but his room is not occupied. They told me I had better ask at this room.’
“他昨晚在巴黎。他在这里登记了，但他的房间没有人住。他们告诉我最好在这个房间问。

‘Sounds very peculiar to me—we saw him off yesterday morning on the boat train.’
“对我来说听起来很奇怪——我们昨天早上在火车上送他走。”

‘Be that as it may, he has been seen here this morning. Even his carte d’identité has been seen. And there you are.’
“不管怎样，今天早上有人看见他在这里。甚至他的身份证明也被人看到了。你就在那里。

‘We know nothing about it,’ she proclaimed in amazement.
“我们对此一无所知，”她惊讶地宣称。

He considered. He was an ill-smelling, handsome man.
他想。他是一个散发着难闻气味的英俊男子。

‘You were not with him at all last night?’
“昨晚你根本没有和他在一起吗？”

‘But no.’
'但不是。'

‘We have arrested a Negro. We are convinced we have at last arrested the correct Negro.’
“我们逮捕了一名黑人。我们确信我们终于逮捕了正确的黑人。”

‘I assure you that I haven’t an idea what you’re talking about. If it’s the Mr. Abraham North, the one we know, well, if he was in Paris last night we weren’t aware of it.’
“我向你保证，我不知道你在说什么。如果是我们认识的亚伯拉罕·诺斯先生，那么，如果他昨晚在巴黎，我们也不知道。

The man nodded, sucked his upper lip, convinced but disappointed.
男人点点头，抿了抿上唇，确信但又失望。

‘What happened?’ Nicole demanded.
“发生了什么事？”妮可问道。

He showed his palms, puffing out his closed mouth. He had begun to find her attractive and his eyes flickered at her.
他伸出手掌，张开闭着的嘴。他开始发现她很有吸引力，他的眼睛在她身上闪烁。

‘What do you wish, Madame? A summer affair. Mr. Afghan North was robbed and he made a complaint. We have arrested the miscreant. Mr. Afghan should come to identify him and make the proper charges.’
‘您想要什么，女士？夏天的事。阿富汗诺斯先生遭遇抢劫，他提出投诉。我们已经逮捕了这个恶棍。阿富汗先生应该来指认他并提出适当的指控。

Nicole pulled her dressing-gown closer around her and dismissed him briskly. Mystified she took a bath and dressed. By this time it was after ten and she called Rosemary but got no answer—then she phoned the hotel office and found that Abe had indeed registered, at six-thirty this morning. His room, however, was still unoccupied. Hoping for a word from Dick she waited in the parlor of the suite; just as she had given up and decided to go out, the office called and announced:
妮可把晨衣拉得更紧，轻快地打发他走了。她疑惑地洗了个澡，穿好衣服。这时已经十点多了，她给罗斯玛丽打电话，但无人接听——然后她给酒店办公室打电话，发现阿部确实登记了，时间是今天早上六点三十分。然而，他的房间仍然空无一人。她在套房的客厅里等待着迪克的消息。正当她放弃并决定出去时，办公室打来电话，宣布：

‘Meestaire Crawshow, un nègre.’
“Meestaire Crawshow，一个黑人。”

‘On what business?’ she demanded.
“做什么事？”她问道。

‘He says he knows you and the doctaire. He says there is a Meestaire Freeman into prison that is a friend of all the world. He says there is injustice and he wishes to see Meestaire North before he himself is arrested.’
“他说他认识你和医生。”他说监狱里有一位梅斯塔尔·弗里曼，他是全世界的朋友。他说这是不公正的，他希望在自己被捕之前见见梅斯特尔·诺斯。

‘We know nothing about it.’ Nicole disclaimed the whole business with a vehement clap of the receiver. Abe’s bizarre reappearance made it plain to her how fatigued she was with his dissipation. Dismissing him from her mind she went out, ran into Rosemary at the dressmaker’s, and shopped with her for artificial flowers and allcolored strings of colored beads on the Rue de Rivoli. She helped Rosemary choose a diamond for her mother, and some scarfs and novel cigarette cases to take home to business associates in California. For her son she bought Greek and Roman soldiers, a whole army of them, costing over a thousand francs. Once again they spent their money in different ways and again Rosemary admired Nicole’s method of spending. Nicole was sure that the money she spent was hers— Rosemary still thought her money was miraculously lent to her and she must consequently be very careful of it.
“我们对此一无所知。”妮可猛烈地拍了一下听筒，否认了整个事情。安倍奇怪的再次出现让她明白，她对他的放荡感到多么厌倦。她把他从脑海中抹去，出去了，在裁缝店里遇见了罗斯玛丽，和她一起在里沃利街买了人造花和各种颜色的彩色珠串。她帮助罗斯玛丽为她的母亲选择了一颗钻石，还帮助她挑选了一些围巾和新颖的烟盒带回家送给加州的商业伙伴。她为儿子购买了希腊和罗马士兵，一整支军队，花费了一千多法郎。他们再次以不同的方式花钱，罗斯玛丽再次钦佩妮可的花钱方式。妮可确信她花的钱是她的——罗斯玛丽仍然认为她的钱是奇迹般地借给她的，因此她必须非常小心。

It was fun spending money in the sunlight of the foreign city with healthy bodies under them that sent streams of color up to their faces; with arms and hands, legs and ankles that they stretched out confidently, reaching or stepping with the confidence of women lovely to men.
在异国城市的阳光下花钱是一件很有趣的事，健康的身体在他们的脸上流淌着色彩。他们自信地伸展手臂、手、腿和脚踝，以女性对男性可爱的自信伸手或迈步。

When they got back to the hotel and found Dick, all bright and new in the morning, both of them had a moment of complete childish joy.
当他们回到旅馆，发现迪克在早上焕然一新时，他们俩都度过了充满童趣的时刻。

He had just received a garbled telephone call from Abe who, so it appeared, had spent the forenoon in hiding.
他刚刚接到安倍打来的一通乱码电话，看来安倍已经躲藏了一上午了。

‘It was one of the most extraordinary telephone conversations I’ve ever held.’
“这是我经历过的最非同寻常的电话交谈之一。”

Dick had talked not only to Abe but to a dozen others. On the phone these supernumeraries had been typically introduced as: ‘— man wants to talk to you is in the teput dome, well he says he was in it—what is it?
迪克不仅与阿贝交谈过，还与其他十几个人交谈过。在电话中，这些多余的东西通常被介绍为：“——男人想和你说话是在特普特圆顶里，好吧，他说他在里面——那是什么？”

‘Hey, somebody, shut-up—anyhow, he was in some shandel-scandal and he kaa POS-sibly go home. My own PER-sonal is that—my personal is he’s had a—‘ Gulps sounded and thereafter what the party had, rested with the unknown.
“嘿，某人，闭嘴——不管怎样，他卷入了一些山德尔丑闻，他可能会回家。”我自己的个人资料是——我个人的资料是他有一个——”咕噜声响起，此后派对上发生了什么，就只剩下未知了。

The phone yielded up a supplementary offer:
电话里传来了补充报价：

‘I thought it would appeal to you anyhow as a psychologist.’ The vague personality who corresponded to this statement was eventually hung on to the phone; in the sequence he failed to appeal to Dick, as a psychologist, or indeed as anything else. Abe’s conversation flowed on as follows:
“我认为无论如何，这都会吸引你作为一名心理学家。” 与这句话相对应的模糊个性最终挂断了电话；从这个顺序来看，他未能吸引迪克作为一名心理学家，或者实际上作为其他任何东西。安倍的对话如下：

‘Hello.’
'你好。'

‘Well?’
'出色地？'

‘Well, hello.’
“嗯，你好。”

‘Who are you?’
'你是谁？'

‘Well.’ There were interpolated snorts of laughter.
“嗯。”一阵笑声夹杂着。

‘Well, I’ll put somebody else on the line.’
“好吧，我会让其他人接电话。”

Sometimes Dick could hear Abe’s voice, accompanied by scufflings, droppings of the receiver, far-away fragments such as, ‘No, I don’t, Mr. North... .’ Then a pert decided voice had said: ‘If you are a friend of Mr. North you will come down and take him away.’
有时迪克能听到阿贝的声音，伴随着扭打声、听筒掉落的声音、远处的碎片，比如“不，我不知道，诺斯先生……”然后一个果断的声音说道：“如果你“是诺斯先生的朋友，你下来把他带走。”

Abe cut in, solemn and ponderous, beating it all down with an overtone of earth-bound determination.
安倍插话进来，语气庄严而沉重，带着一种脚踏实地的决心，把这一切都打倒了。

‘Dick, I’ve launched a race riot in Montmartre. I’m going over and get Freeman out of jail. If a Negro from Copenhagen that makes shoe polish—hello, can you hear me—well, look, if anybody comes there—‘ Once again the receiver was a chorus of innumerable melodies.
“迪克，我在蒙马特发起了一场种族骚乱。我要去把弗里曼从监狱里救出来。如果一个来自哥本哈根的黑人制作鞋油——你好，你能听到我说话吗——好吧，听着，如果有人来的话——”听筒里再次响起了无数旋律的合唱。

‘Why you back in Paris?’ Dick demanded.
“你为什么回到巴黎？”迪克问道。

‘I got as far as Evreux, and I decided to take a plane back so I could compare it with St. Sulpice. I mean I don’t intend to bring St. Sulpice back to Paris. I don’t even mean Baroque! I meant St. Germain. For God’s sake, wait a minute and I’ll put the chasseur on the wire.’
“我到达了埃夫勒，我决定坐飞机回去，这样我就可以将它与圣叙尔皮斯进行比较。我的意思是我不打算把圣叙尔皮斯带回巴黎。我什至不是指巴洛克！我指的是圣日耳曼。看在上帝的份上，等一下，我会把猎手放在电线上。

‘For God’s sake, don’t.’
“看在上帝的份上，别这么做。”

‘Listen—did Mary get off all right?’
“听着——玛丽下车了吗？”

‘Yes.’
'是的。'

‘Dick, I want you to talk with a man I met here this morning, the son of a naval officer that’s been to every doctor in Europe. Let me tell you about him—‘
“迪克，我想让你和我今天早上在这里遇到的一个人谈谈，他是一位海军军官的儿子，他去过欧洲的所有医生。让我告诉你关于他的事情——”

Dick had rung off at this point—perhaps that was a piece of ingratitude for he needed grist for the grinding activity of his mind.
迪克在这个时候挂了电话——也许这是一种忘恩负义的表现，因为他需要能量来应对他头脑中的磨砺活动。

‘Abe used to be so nice,’ Nicole told Rosemary. ‘So nice. Long ago—when Dick and I were first married. If you had known him then. He’d come to stay with us for weeks and weeks and we scarcely knew he was in the house. Sometimes he’d play—sometimes he’d be in the library with a muted piano, making love to it by the hour—Dick, do you remember that maid? She thought he was a ghost and sometimes Abe used to meet her in the hall and moo at her, and it cost us a whole tea service once—but we didn’t care.’
“阿贝曾经非常友善，”妮可告诉罗斯玛丽。 '太赞了。很久以前——当迪克和我刚结婚的时候。如果你当时就认识他就好了。他来和我们一起住了好几个星期，而我们几乎不知道他在家里。有时他会弹奏——有时他会在图书馆里用静音的钢琴，按小时与它做爱——迪克，你还记得那个女仆吗？她认为他是个鬼魂，有时安倍常常在大厅里遇见她，并对她发出哞哞声，有一次我们花了整整一顿茶水——但我们不在乎。

So much fun—so long ago. Rosemary envied them their fun, imagining a life of leisure unlike her own. She knew little of leisure but she had the respect for it of those who have never had it. She thought of it as a resting, without realizing that the Divers were as far from relaxing as she was herself.
太有趣了——很久以前了。罗斯玛丽羡慕他们的乐趣，想象着与自己不同的悠闲生活。她对闲暇知之甚少，但她却尊重那些从未享受过闲暇的人。她以为这是一种休息，却没有意识到戴弗们和她自己一样远没有放松。

‘What did this to him?’ she asked. ‘Why does he have to drink?’
“这对他造成了什么？”她问道。 “他为什么要喝酒？”

Nicole shook her head right and left, disclaiming responsibility for the matter: ‘So many smart men go to pieces nowadays.’
妮可左右摇头，否认自己对此事负责：“现在很多聪明人都崩溃了。”

‘And when haven’t they?’ Dick asked. ‘Smart men play close to the line because they have to—some of them can’t stand it, so they quit.’
“什么时候没有？”迪克问。 “聪明人会靠近底线，因为他们不得不这样做——他们中的一些人无法忍受，所以他们退出了。”

‘It must lie deeper than that.’ Nicole clung to her conversation; also she was irritated that Dick should contradict her before Rosemary. ‘Artists like—well, like Fernand don’t seem to have to wallow in alcohol. Why is it just Americans who dissipate?’
“事情一定比这更深。”妮可继续她的谈话。她还因为迪克在罗斯玛丽面前反驳她而感到恼火。 “像费尔南德这样的艺术家似乎不必沉迷于酒精。为什么只有美国人才消散？

There were so many answers to this question that Dick decided to leave it in the air, to buzz victoriously in Nicole’s ears. He had become intensely critical of her. Though he thought she was the most attractive human creature he had ever seen, though he got from her everything he needed, he scented battle from afar, and subconsciously he had been hardening and arming himself, hour by hour. He was not given to self-indulgence and he felt comparatively graceless at this moment of indulging himself, blinding his eyes with the hope that Nicole guessed at only an emotional excitement about Rosemary. He was not sure—last night at the theatre she had referred pointedly to Rosemary as a child.
这个问题有太多的答案，迪克决定把它留在空中，在妮可的耳边嗡嗡作响。他对她变得非常严厉。尽管他认为她是他见过的最有魅力的人类，尽管他从她那里得到了他所需要的一切，但他从远处嗅到了战斗的气息，潜意识里他一直在一小时一小时地坚强和武装自己。他不习惯自我放纵，在这一刻放纵自己，他感到比较不优雅，他蒙蔽了双眼，希望妮可猜到的只是罗斯玛丽的情绪激动。他不确定——昨晚在剧院，她尖锐地提到了小时候的罗斯玛丽。

The trio lunched downstairs in an atmosphere of carpets and padded waiters, who did not march at the stomping quick-step of those men who brought good food to the tables whereon they had recently dined. Here there were families of Americans staring around at families of Americans, and trying to make conversation with one another.
三人在楼下吃午饭，周围都是铺着地毯和垫着垫子的服务员，他们并没有像那些把美味佳肴送到他们最近用餐的桌子上的人那样快步前进。这里有一些美国人的家庭，他们环顾四周，试图互相交谈。

There was a party at the next table that they could not account for. It consisted of an expansive, somewhat secretarial, wouldyou-mind-repeating young man, and a score of women. The women were neither young nor old nor of any particular social class; yet the party gave the impression of a unit, held more closely together for example than a group of wives stalling through a professional congress of their husbands. Certainly it was more of a unit than any conceivable tourist party.
隔壁桌有一场聚会，他们无法解释。里面有一个心胸宽广、有点秘书气质、爱说三道四的年轻人和二十个女人。这些妇女不年轻也不年老，也不属于任何特定的社会阶层；然而，该党给人的印象是一个整体，比一群妻子在丈夫的专业代表大会上拖延更紧密地团结在一起。当然，它比任何可以想象的旅游团体更像一个单位。

An instinct made Dick suck back the grave derision that formed on his tongue; he asked the waiter to find out who they were.
迪克本能地收回了嘴里的嘲讽。他请服务员查明他们是谁。

‘Those are the gold-star muzzers,’ explained the waiter.
“那些是金星枪口，”服务员解释道。

Aloud and in low voices they exclaimed. Rosemary’s eyes filled with tears.
他们大声或低声惊呼。罗斯玛丽的眼里充满了泪水。

‘Probably the young ones are the wives,’ said Nicole.
“可能那些年轻人就是妻子，”妮可说。

Over his wine Dick looked at them again; in their happy faces, the dignity that surrounded and pervaded the party, he perceived all the maturity of an older America. For a while the sobered women who had come to mourn for their dead, for something they could not repair, made the room beautiful. Momentarily, he sat again on his father’s knee, riding with Moseby while the old loyalties and devotions fought on around him. Almost with an effort he turned back to his two women at the table and faced the whole new world in which he believed.
迪克一边喝着酒，一边再次看着他们。从他们幸福的脸上，在党内弥漫的尊严中，他看到了一个古老的美国的成熟。有一段时间，清醒的妇女们前来哀悼死者，哀悼她们无法修复的东西，这让房间变得美丽起来。一会儿，他又坐在父亲的膝盖上，与莫斯比一起骑行，而旧日的忠诚和奉献在他周围继续战斗。他几乎费了很大的力气才转身面对桌边的两个女人，面对他所相信的整个新世界。

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?
——你介意我把窗帘拉下来吗？

第二十三

Abe North was still in the Ritz bar, where he had been since nine in the morning. When he arrived seeking sanctuary the windows were open and great beams were busy at pulling up the dust from smoky carpets and cushions. Chasseurs tore through the corridors, liberated and disembodied, moving for the moment in pure space. The sit-down bar for women, across from the bar proper, seemed very small—it was hard to imagine what throngs it could accommodate in the afternoon.
阿贝·诺斯仍在丽兹酒吧里，他从早上九点起就一直待在那里。当他到达避难所时，窗户开着，巨大的横梁正忙着吸走烟雾缭绕的地毯和垫子上的灰尘。猎兵们冲破走廊，获得了解放，脱离了实体，暂时在纯粹的空间中移动。酒吧对面的女士吧台看起来很小，很难想象下午这里能容纳多少人。

The famous Paul, the concessionaire, had not arrived, but Claude, who was checking stock, broke off his work with no improper surprise to make Abe a pick-me-up. Abe sat on a bench against a wall. After two drinks he began to feel better—so much better that he mounted to the barber’s shop and was shaved. When he returned to the bar Paul had arrived—in his custom-built motor, from which he had disembarked correctly at the Boulevard des Capucines. Paul liked Abe and came over to talk.
著名的特许经营商保罗还没有到来，但正在检查库存的克劳德中断了工作，毫不意外地让阿部提神。阿部坐在靠墙的长凳上。喝了两杯之后，他开始感觉好多了——好多了，以至于他爬到理发店刮了胡子。当他回到酒吧时，保罗已经到了——开着他定制的汽车，他在卡普西尼大道正确地下了车。保罗喜欢阿贝，就过来聊天。

‘I was supposed to ship home this morning,’ Abe said. ‘I mean yesterday morning, or whatever this is.’
“我本来应该今天早上乘船回家，”安倍说。 “我是说昨天早上，或者不管是什么。”

‘Why din you?’ asked Paul.
“你为什么吵架？”保罗问。

Abe considered, and happened finally to a reason: ‘I was reading a serial in Liberty and the next installment was due here in Paris— so if I’d sailed I’d have missed it—then I never would have read it.’
安倍想了想，最后想到了一个原因：“我正在读《自由》杂志的连载，而下一期将在巴黎到期——所以如果我航行的话我就会错过它——那么我就永远不会读它了。”

‘It must be a very good story.’
“这一定是一个非常好的故事。”

‘It’s a terr-r-rible story.’
“这是一个可怕、可怕的故事。”

Paul arose chuckling and paused, leaning on the back of a chair:
保罗笑着站起来，靠在椅背上停了下来：

‘If you really want to get off, Mr. North, there are friends of yours going to-morrow on the France—Mister what is this name—and Slim Pearson. Mister—I’ll think of it—tall with a new beard.’
“如果你真的想下车，诺斯先生，你的朋友们明天就要去法国——先生，这个名字是什么——还有斯利姆·皮尔森。先生——我会想到的——很高，留着新胡子。

‘Yardly,’ Abe supplied.
“亚伯补充道。”

‘Mr. Yardly. They’re both going on the France.’
'先生。亚德利。他们都要去法国。

He was on his way to his duties but Abe tried to detain him: ‘If I didn’t have to go by way of Cherbourg. The baggage went that way.’
他正在去履行职责的路上，但安倍试图扣留他：“如果我不必经过瑟堡就好了。”行李就是那样走的。”

‘Get your baggage in New York,’ said Paul, receding.
“到纽约去取行李吧，”保罗一边说着，一边往后退去。

The logic of the suggestion fitted gradually into Abe’s pitch—he grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for, or rather of prolonging his state of irresponsibility.
这个建议的逻辑逐渐符合安倍的主张——他越来越热衷于被照顾，或者更确切地说，热衷于延长他不负责任的状态。

Other clients had meanwhile drifted in to the bar: first came a huge Dane whom Abe had somewhere encountered. The Dane took a seat across the room, and Abe guessed he would be there all the day, drinking, lunching, talking or reading newspapers. He felt a desire to out-stay him. At eleven the college boys began to step in, stepping gingerly lest they tear one another bag from bag. It was about then he had the chasseur telephone to the Divers; by the time he was in touch with them he was in touch also with other friends—and his hunch was to put them all on different phones at once—the result was somewhat general. From time to time his mind reverted to the fact that he ought to go over and get Freeman out of jail, but he shook off all facts as parts of the nightmare.
与此同时，其他顾客也涌进了酒吧：首先来的是一位身材高大的丹麦人，他是安倍在哪里遇到的。丹麦人在房间对面的座位上坐下，安倍猜测他会整天呆在那里，喝酒、吃午饭、聊天或看报纸。他有一种想要超越他的渴望。十一点钟，大学生们开始介入，小心翼翼地走着，以免撕破袋子。就在那时，他用猎手电话打给了戴弗夫妇。当他与他们取得联系时，他也与其他朋友取得了联系——他的预感是同时将他们全部放在不同的手机上——结果有些笼统。有时他的思绪会回到他应该过去把弗里曼带出监狱的事实，但他摆脱了所有作为噩梦一部分的事实。

By one o’clock the bar was jammed; amidst the consequent mixture of voices the staff of waiters functioned, pinning down their clients to the facts of drink and money.
到了一点钟，酒吧就挤满了人。在一片混杂的声音中，侍者们各司其职，把客人们逼到酒和钱的事实上。

‘That makes two stingers ... and one more ... two martinis and one ... nothing for you, Mr. Quarterly ... that makes three rounds. That makes seventy-five francs, Mr. Quarterly. Mr. Schaeffer said he had this—you had the last ... I can only do what you say ... thanks vera-much.’
“这使得两杯毒刺……又一杯……两杯马提尼酒和一杯……对你来说没什么，季特利先生……三轮。一共七十五法郎，奎特利先生。谢弗先生说他有这个——你有最后一个……我只能按你说的做……非常感谢。

In the confusion Abe had lost his seat; now he stood gently swaying and talking to some of the people with whom he had involved himself. A terrier ran a leash around his legs but Abe managed to extricate himself without upsetting and became the recipient of profuse apologies. Presently he was invited to lunch, but declined. It was almost Briglith, he explained, and there was something he had to do at Briglith. A little later, with the exquisite manners of the alcoholic that are like the manners of a prisoner or a family servant, he said good-by to an acquaintance, and turning around discovered that the bar’s great moment was over as precipitately as it had begun.
在一片混乱中，安倍失去了座位。现在，他轻轻地摇晃着站着，与一些与他交往过的人交谈。一只小猎犬用皮带拴住了他的腿，但安倍成功地逃脱了，没有感到不安，并成为了道歉的对象。目前，他被邀请共进午餐，但他拒绝了。他解释说，这几乎就是布里格利斯了，他必须在布里格利斯做一些事情。过了一会儿，他以酒鬼那种囚犯或家仆般的精致举止，向一个熟人道别，一转身，发现酒吧的伟大时刻结束得和开始时一样仓促。 。

Across from him the Dane and his companions had ordered luncheon. Abe did likewise but scarcely touched it. Afterwards, he just sat, happy to live in the past. The drink made past happy things contemporary with the present, as if they were still going on, contemporary even with the future as if they were about to happen again.
在他对面，丹麦人和他的同伴已经点了午餐。安倍也做了同样的事，但几乎没有碰它。随后，他只是坐着，幸福地活在过去。这种饮料让过去的快乐的事情变得与现在同步，仿佛它们仍在继续，甚至与未来同步，仿佛它们即将再次发生。

At four the chasseur approached him:
四点钟，猎手走近他：

‘You wish to see a colored fellow of the name Jules Peterson?’
“你想见一个名叫朱尔斯·彼得森的黑人吗？”

‘God! How did he find me?’
'上帝！他是怎么找到我的？

‘I didn’t tell him you were present.’
“我没有告诉他你在场。”

‘Who did?’ Abe fell over his glasses but recovered himself.
“谁干的？”阿贝的眼镜摔倒了，但很快又恢复了过来。

‘Says he’s already been around to all the American bars and hotels.’
“说他已经走遍了美国所有的酒吧和酒店。”

‘Tell him I’m not here—‘ As the chasseur turned away Abe asked: ‘Can he come in here?’
“告诉他我不在这里——”当猎手转身离开时，亚伯问：“他能进来吗？”

‘I’ll find out.’
'我会查明真相的。'

Receiving the question Paul glanced over his shoulder; he shook his head, then seeing Abe he came over.
听到这个问题，保罗回头看了一眼。他摇摇头，然后看到阿贝就走了过来。

‘I’m sorry; I can’t allow it.’
'对不起;我不能允许。

Abe got himself up with an effort and went out to the Rue Cambon.
阿贝努力站起来，走到康朋街。

第二十四章

With his miniature leather brief-case in his hand Richard Diver walked from the seventh arrondisement—where he left a note for Maria Wallis signed ‘Dicole,’ the word with which he and Nicole had signed communications in the first days of love—to his shirtmakers where the clerks made a fuss over him out of proportion to the money he spent. Ashamed at promising so much to these poor Englishmen, with his fine manners, his air of having the key to security, ashamed of making a tailor shift an inch of silk on his arm. Afterward he went to the bar of the Crillon and drank a small coffee and two fingers of gin.
理查德·戴弗 (Richard Diver) 手里提着微型皮革公文包，从第七区走来，他在那里给玛丽亚·沃利斯 (Maria Wallis) 留了一张纸条，署名“Dicole”，这是他和妮可在恋爱初期签署的通信用词。衬衫制造商那里，店员对他大惊小怪，与他花的钱不成比例。羞于向这些可怜的英国人许诺这么多，以他良好的举止，他拥有安全钥匙的神态，羞于让裁缝在他的手臂上移动一英寸的丝绸。随后他去了克里永酒店的酒吧，喝了一小杯咖啡和两指杜松子酒。

As he entered the hotel the halls had seemed unnaturally bright; when he left he realized that it was because it had already turned dark outside. It was a windy four-o’clock night with the leaves on the Champs Élysées singing and failing, thin and wild. Dick turned down the Rue de Rivoli, walking two squares under the arcades to his bank where there was mail. Then he took a taxi and started up the Champs Élysées through the first patter of rain, sitting alone with his love.
当他走进酒店时，大厅显得异常明亮。当他离开时，他意识到这是因为外面天已经黑了。那是一个刮风的四点钟夜晚，香榭丽舍大街上的树叶歌唱着，衰落着，稀疏而狂野。迪克转入里沃利路，在拱廊下走了两个广场，来到了他的银行，那里有邮件。然后，他乘出租车，冒着第一阵雨，沿着香榭丽舍大街出发，独自和他的爱人坐在一起。

Back at two o’clock in the Roi George corridor the beauty of Nicole had been to the beauty of Rosemary as the beauty of Leonardo’s girl was to that of the girl of an illustrator. Dick moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions of many men inside him and nothing simple that he could see.
两点钟，在乔治王走廊里，妮可的美丽与罗斯玛丽的美丽之比，就像莱昂纳多的女孩的美丽与插画家的女孩的美丽之比一样。迪克在雨中继续前行，充满了恶魔般的恐惧，他内心充满了许多人的激情，但他看不到任何简单的东西。

Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of. She was now what is sometimes called a ‘little wild thing’—by twentyfour full hours she was not yet unified and she was absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a picture puzzle— counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off Dick, Nicole, her mother, the director she met yesterday, like stops on a string of beads.
罗斯玛丽打开门，心里充满了别人不知道的情感。她现在成了有时被称为“小野物”的人——到了整整二十四小时，她还没有统一起来，她全神贯注地玩弄混乱；仿佛她的命运是一幅图画拼图——数着利益，数着希望，斥责迪克、妮可、她的母亲、她昨天遇到的导演，就像在一串珠子上停下来一样。

When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly Hills. When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed and Godlike as he had always been, as older people are to younger, rigid and unmalleable. Dick saw her with an inevitable sense of disappointment. It took him a moment to respond to the unguarded sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower. He was conscious of the print of her wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.
迪克敲门时，她刚刚穿好衣服，正在看雨，想着一首诗，想着比佛利山庄满水的排水沟。当她打开门时，她看到他像以前一样固定而神圣，就像老年人对年轻人一样，僵化且不可塑。迪克看到她，不可避免地感到失望。他过了一会儿才对她毫无防备的甜蜜微笑做出反应，她的身体精确到毫米，暗示着花蕾，但也保证了花朵。隔着浴室的门，他都能感觉到地毯上她湿漉漉的脚印。

‘Miss Television,’ he said with a lightness he did not feel. He put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his stick against the wall. His chin dominated the lines of pain around his mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the corner of his eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.
“电视小姐，”他语气轻松地说，但他并没有感觉到。他把手套、公文包放在梳妆台上，把手杖靠在墙上。他的下巴控制住了嘴角周围的疼痛线条，将它们推到了额头和眼角，就像不能在公共场合表现出来的恐惧。

‘Come and sit on my lap close to me,’ he said softly, ‘and let me see about your lovely mouth.’
“过来坐在我腿上，靠近我，”他轻声说道，“让我看看你可爱的嘴巴。”

She came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed down outside—drip—dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful cold image she had created.
她走过来坐在那里，当外面的滴水速度减慢时——滴——滴——滴——她把嘴唇放在了她创造的美丽的冰冷形象上。

Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, her face getting big as it came up to him; he had never seen anything so dazzling as the quality of her skin, and since sometimes beauty gives back the images of one’s best thoughts he thought of his responsibility about Nicole, and of the responsibility of her being two doors down across the corridor.
不久，她在他嘴里亲了好几下，脸凑到他面前时变大了。他从来没有见过比她的皮肤更耀眼的东西，因为有时美丽会反映出一个人最好的想法，他想到了他对妮可的责任，以及她在走廊对面两扇门的责任。

‘The rain’s over,’ he said. ‘Do you see the sun on the slate?’
“雨停了，”他说。 “你看到石板上的太阳了吗？”

Rosemary stood up and leaned down and said her most sincere thing to him:
罗斯玛丽站起来，俯身对他说了她最真诚的话：

‘Oh, we’re such ACTORS—you and I.’
“哦，我们真是演员——你和我。”

She went to her dresser and the moment that she laid her comb flat against her hair there was a slow persistent knocking at the door.
她走到梳妆台前，刚把梳子平放在头发上，门就响起了缓慢而持续的敲门声。

They were shocked motionless; the knock was repeated insistently, and in the sudden realization that the door was not locked Rosemary finished her hair with one stroke, nodded at Dick who had quickly jerked the wrinkles out of the bed where they had been sitting, and started for the door. Dick said in quite a natural voice, not too loud:
他们惊呆了，一动不动。敲门声不断地重复着，罗斯玛丽突然意识到门没有锁，她一下子梳理了头发，对迪克点了点头，迪克迅速把他们坐的床上的皱纹从床上拉了起来，然后向门口走去。迪克用相当自然的声音说道：

‘—so if you don’t feel up to going out, I’ll tell Nicole and we’ll have a very quiet last evening.’
“——所以如果你不想出去，我会告诉妮可，我们昨晚会过得很安静。”

The precautions were needless for the situation of the parties outside the door was so harassed as to preclude any but the most fleeting judgments on matters not pertinent to themselves. Standing there was Abe, aged by several months in the last twentyfour hours, and a very frightened, concerned colored man whom Abe introduced as Mr. Peterson of Stockholm.
预防措施是不必要的，因为门外各方的处境如此混乱，除了对与自己无关的事情做出最短暂的判断外，无法做出任何判断。站在那里的是阿贝，他在过去的二十四小时里苍老了几个月，还有一个非常害怕、忧心忡忡的黑人男子，阿贝介绍他为斯德哥尔摩的彼得森先生。

‘He’s in a terrible situation and it’s my fault,’ said Abe. ‘We need some good advice.’
“他的处境很糟糕，这是我的错，”安倍说。 “我们需要一些好的建议。”

‘Come in our rooms,’ said Dick.
“到我们的房间来吧，”迪克说。

Abe insisted that Rosemary come too and they crossed the hall to the Divers’ suite. Jules Peterson, a small, respectable Negro, on the suave model that heels the Republican party in the border States, followed.
阿部坚持让罗斯玛丽也来，然后他们穿过大厅来到潜水员套房。朱尔斯·彼得森（Jules Peterson）是一位身材矮小、受人尊敬的黑人，他的温和风格在边境各州追随共和党。

It appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the early morning dispute in Montparnasse; he had accompanied Abe to the police station and supported his assertion that a thousand franc note had been seized out of his hand by a Negro, whose identification was one of the points of the case. Abe and Jules Peterson, accompanied by an agent of police, returned to the bistro and too hastily identified as the criminal a Negro, who, so it was established after an hour, had only entered the place after Abe left. The police had further complicated the situation by arresting the prominent Negro restaurateur, Freeman, who had only drifted through the alcoholic fog at a very early stage and then vanished. The true culprit, whose case, as reported by his friends, was that he had merely commandeered a fifty-franc note to pay for drinks that Abe had ordered, had only recently and in a somewhat sinister rôle, reappeared upon the scene.
看来后者是蒙帕纳斯清晨纠纷的合法证人；他陪同安倍前往警察局，并支持他的说法，即一名黑人从他手中夺走了一张千法郎纸币，该黑人的身份是此案的要点之一。安倍和朱尔斯·彼得森在一名警察的陪同下回到小酒馆，匆忙地认定罪犯是一名黑人，一小时后证实，这名黑人是在安倍离开后才进入这个地方的。警方逮捕了著名的黑人餐馆老板弗里曼，使情况变得更加复杂，弗里曼很早就在酒精迷雾中漂流，然后就消失了。据他的朋友们报道，真正的罪魁祸首是他仅仅强占了一张五十法郎的钞票来支付安倍订购的饮料，而他最近才以一种有点险恶的角色再次出现在现场。

In brief, Abe had succeeded in the space of an hour in entangling himself with the personal lives, consciences, and emotions of one Afro-European and three Afro-Americans inhabiting the French Latin quarter. The disentanglement was not even faintly in sight and the day had passed in an atmosphere of unfamiliar Negro faces bobbing up in unexpected places and around unexpected corners, and insistent Negro voices on the phone.
简而言之，安倍在一个小时内成功地与居住在法国拉丁区的一名非裔欧洲人和三名非裔美国人的个人生活、良心和情感纠缠在一起。解开的迹象甚至都看不到，这一天就在一种陌生的黑人面孔出现在意想不到的地方和意想不到的角落、电话里坚持不懈的黑人声音的气氛中过去了。

In person, Abe had succeeded in evading all of them, save Jules Peterson. Peterson was rather in the position of the friendly Indian who had helped a white. The Negroes who suffered from the betrayal were not so much after Abe as after Peterson, and Peterson was very much after what protection he might get from Abe.
就个人而言，安倍成功地避开了所有人，除了朱尔斯·彼得森。彼得森的处境更像是帮助白人的友好印第安人。遭受背叛的黑人与其说是在追随安倍，不如说是在追随彼得森，而彼得森非常希望从安倍那里得到什么保护。

Up in Stockholm Peterson had failed as a small manufacturer of shoe polish and now possessed only his formula and sufficient trade tools to fill a small box; however, his new protector had promised in the early hours to set him up in business in Versailles. Abe’s former chauffeur was a shoemaker there and Abe had handed Peterson two hundred francs on account.
在斯德哥尔摩，彼得森作为一家小型鞋油制造商失败了，现在只拥有他的配方和足够的贸易工具来装满一个小盒子；然而，他的新保护人在凌晨时许诺让他在凡尔赛宫做生意。安倍的前司机是那里的一名鞋匠，安倍已经向彼得森支付了两百法郎的欠款。

Rosemary listened with distaste to this rigmarole; to appreciate its grotesquerie required a more robust sense of humor than hers. The little man with his portable manufactory, his insincere eyes that, from time to time, rolled white semicircles of panic into view; the figure of Abe, his face as blurred as the gaunt fine lines of it would permit—all this was as remote from her as sickness.
罗斯玛丽厌恶地听着这些胡言乱语。要欣赏它的怪诞，需要比她更强烈的幽默感。那个拿着便携式工厂的小个子男人，他那双不真诚的眼睛，不时地在视野中滚动出白色的半圆形的惊慌。阿部的身影，他的脸在憔悴的细纹所允许的范围内变得模糊——这一切对她来说就像疾病一样遥远。

‘I ask only a chance in life,’ said Peterson with the sort of precise yet distorted intonation peculiar to colonial countries. ‘My methods are simple, my formula is so good that I was drove away from Stockholm, ruined, because I did not care to dispose of it.’
“我只要求生命中的一次机会，”彼得森用殖民地国家特有的那种精确但扭曲的语调说道。 “我的方法很简单，我的配方非常好，以至于我被赶出了斯德哥尔摩，毁了，因为我不想处理它。”

Dick regarded him politely—interest formed, dissolved, he turned to Abe:
迪克礼貌地看着他——兴趣产生了，消失了，他转向亚伯：

‘You go to some hotel and go to bed. After you’re all straight Mr. Peterson will come and see you.’
“你去一家旅馆然后上床睡觉。当你完全恢复正常后，彼得森先生会来看你。

‘But don’t you appreciate the mess that Peterson’s in?’ Abe protested.
“但是你难道不欣赏彼得森所处的混乱局面吗？”安倍抗议道。

‘I shall wait in the hall,’ said Mr. Peterson with delicacy. ‘It is perhaps hard to discuss my problems in front of me.’
“我会在大厅里等。”彼得森先生小心翼翼地说。 “也许很难在我面前讨论我的问题。”

He withdrew after a short travesty of a French bow; Abe pulled himself to his feet with the deliberation of a locomotive.
他短暂地模仿了法国人的鞠躬动作后就退出了。安倍像机车一样缓慢地站了起来。

‘I don’t seem highly popular to-day.’
“我今天似乎不太受欢迎。”

‘Popular but not probable,’ Dick advised him. ‘My advice is to leave this hotel—by way of the bar, if you want. Go to the Chambord, or if you’ll need a lot of service, go over to the Majestic.’
“很受欢迎，但不太可能，”迪克建议他。 “我的建议是离开这家酒店——如果你愿意的话，可以通过酒吧。”去Chambord，或者如果您需要很多服务，就去Majestic。

‘Could I annoy you for a drink?’
“我可以打扰你喝一杯吗？”

‘There’s not a thing up here,’ Dick lied.
“这里什么也没有，”迪克撒谎道。

Resignedly Abe shook hands with Rosemary; he composed his face slowly, holding her hand a long time and forming sentences that did not emerge.
阿部无奈地与罗斯玛丽握手。他慢慢地镇定下来，握着她的手很长一段时间，说出了一些没有浮现出来的句子。

‘You are the most—one of the most—‘
“你是最——最——”

She was sorry, and rather revolted at his dirty hands, but she laughed in a well-bred way, as though it were nothing unusual to her to watch a man walking in a slow dream. Often people display a curious respect for a man drunk, rather like the respect of simple races for the insane. Respect rather than fear. There is something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions, who will do anything. Of course we make him pay afterward for his moment of superiority, his moment of impressiveness. Abe turned to Dick with a last appeal.
她很抱歉，而且相当反感他的脏手，但她笑得很有教养，仿佛看着一个男人在缓慢的梦中行走对她来说没什么不寻常的。人们常常对醉酒的人表现出一种奇怪的尊重，就像简单种族对疯子的尊重一样。尊重而不是恐惧。一个人一旦失去了所有的束缚，愿意做任何事情，就会有一种令人敬畏的感觉。当然，我们会让他事后为他的优越时刻、他令人印象深刻的时刻付出代价。阿部向迪克发出最后的呼吁。

‘If I go to a hotel and get all steamed and curry-combed, and sleep awhile, and fight off these Senegalese—could I come and spend the evening by the fireside?’
“如果我去一家旅馆，蒸熟了，梳了咖喱，睡了一会儿，击退了这些塞内加尔人——我可以在炉边度过一个晚上吗？”

Dick nodded at him, less in agreement than in mockery and said: ‘You have a high opinion of your current capacities.’
迪克向他点点头，与其说是同意，不如说是嘲讽，说道：“你对自己目前的能力评价很高。”

‘I bet if Nicole was here she’d let me come back.’
“我敢打赌，如果妮可在这里，她会让我回来。”

‘All right.’ Dick went to a trunk tray and brought a box to the central table; inside were innumerable cardboard letters.
“好吧。”迪克走到行李箱托盘前，拿了一个盒子到中央的桌子上。里面有无数的纸板字母。

‘You can come if you want to play anagrams.’
“如果你想玩字谜游戏，你可以来。”

Abe eyed the contents of the box with physical revulsion, as though he had been asked to eat them like oats.
安倍看着盒子里的东西，感到身体上的厌恶，就好像他被要求像吃燕麦一样吃它们。

‘What are anagrams? Haven’t I had enough strange—‘
‘什么是字谜？我还没有受够奇怪的——”

‘It’s a quiet game. You spell words with them—any word except alcohol.’
‘这是一场安静的比赛。你可以用它们拼出单词——除了酒精之外的任何单词。

‘I bet you can spell alcohol,’ Abe plunged his hand among the counters. ‘Can I come back if I can spell alcohol?’
“我打赌你会拼写酒精，”阿贝把手伸进柜台里。 “如果我会拼写酒精，我可以回来吗？”

‘You can come back if you want to play anagrams.’
“如果你想玩字谜游戏，可以回来。”

Abe shook his head resignedly.
阿部无奈地摇摇头。

‘If you’re in that frame of mind there’s no use—I’d just be in the way.’ He waved his finger reproachfully at Dick. ‘But remember what George the third said, that if Grant was drunk he wished he would bite the other generals.’
“如果你有这种心态，那是没有用的——我只是碍事。”他责备地向迪克挥了挥手指。 “但请记住乔治三世说过的话，如果格兰特喝醉了，他希望自己能咬其他将军。”

With a last desperate glance at Rosemary from the golden corners of his eyes, he went out. To his relief Peterson was no longer in the corridor. Feeling lost and homeless he went back to ask Paul the name of that boat.
他用金色的眼角绝望地看了罗斯玛丽最后一眼，然后走了出去。令他松了口气的是，彼得森已经不在走廊里了。他感到迷失和无家可归，他回去问保罗那条船的名字。

XXV
二十五

When he had tottered out, Dick and Rosemary embraced fleetingly. There was a dust of Paris over both of them through which they scented each other: the rubber guard on Dick’s fountain pen, the faintest odor of warmth from Rosemary’s neck and shoulders. For another half-minute Dick clung to the situation; Rosemary was first to return to reality.
当他摇摇晃晃地走出来时，迪克和罗斯玛丽短暂地拥抱在一起。他们身上都沾满了巴黎的灰尘，通过它们彼此闻到了彼此的气味：迪克钢笔上的橡胶护套，罗斯玛丽脖子和肩膀上散发出的最微弱的温暖气味。迪克又坚持了半分钟。迷迭香最先回到了现实。

‘I must go, youngster,’ she said.
“我必须走了，年轻人，”她说。

They blinked at each other across a widening space, and Rosemary made an exit that she had learned young, and on which no director had ever tried to improve.
他们隔着越来越宽的空间互相眨眼，罗斯玛丽以她年轻时就学会的方式退出，没有导演试图改进这一点。

She opened the door of her room and went directly to her desk where she had suddenly remembered leaving her wristwatch. It was there; slipping it on she glanced down at the daily letter to her mother, finishing the last sentence in her mind. Then, rather gradually, she realized without turning about that she was not alone in the room.
她打开房门，径直走到办公桌前，突然想起自己的手表落在了办公桌前。它就在那儿；她戴上它，低头看了一眼每天写给母亲的信，在心里完成了最后一句话。然后，慢慢地，她不用转身就意识到房间里并不只有她一个人。

In an inhabited room there are refracting objects only half noticed: varnished wood, more or less polished brass, silver and ivory, and beyond these a thousand conveyers of light and shadow so mild that one scarcely thinks of them as that, the tops of pictureframes, the edges of pencils or ash-trays, of crystal or china ornaments; the totality of this refraction—appealing to equally subtle reflexes of the vision as well as to those associational fragments in the subconscious that we seem to hang on to, as a glass-fitter keeps the irregularly shaped pieces that may do some time—this fact might account for what Rosemary afterward mystically described as ‘realizing’ that there was some one in the room, before she could determine it. But when she did realize it she turned swift in a sort of ballet step and saw that a dead Negro was stretched upon her bed.
在一间有人居住的房间里，有一些人们很少注意到的折射物体：涂漆的木头，或多或少抛光的黄铜，银和象牙，除此之外还有一千个光线和阴影的传送器，它们是如此温和，以至于人们几乎不会将它们视为相框的顶部、铅笔或烟灰缸、水晶或瓷器装饰品的边缘；这种折射的整体——吸引同样微妙的视觉反射，以及潜意识中那些我们似乎紧紧抓住的联想碎片，就像玻璃装配工保留可能会持续一段时间的不规则形状的碎片——这个事实这可能解释了罗斯玛丽后来神秘地描述的“意识到”房间里有人，然后她才确定这一点。但当她意识到这一点时，她像芭蕾舞步一样迅速转身，看到一个死去的黑人躺在她的床上。

As she cried ‘aaouu!’ and her still unfastened wristwatch banged against the desk she had the preposterous idea that it was Abe North. Then she dashed for the door and across the hall.
当她喊出“啊啊！”时，她仍未扣上的手表撞在桌子上，她产生了一个荒谬的想法，那就是亚伯·诺斯。然后她冲向门口，穿过大厅。

Dick was straightening up; he had examined the gloves worn that day and thrown them into a pile of soiled gloves in a corner of a trunk. He had hung up coat and vest and spread his shirt on another hanger—a trick of his own. ‘You’ll wear a shirt that’s a little dirty where you won’t wear a mussed shirt.’ Nicole had come in and was dumping one of Abe’s extraordinary ash-trays into the waste-basket when Rosemary tore into the room.
迪克正直起身来。他检查了那天戴的手套，然后把它们扔进了行李箱一角的一堆脏手套里。他把外套和背心挂起来，然后把衬衫挂在另一个衣架上——这是他自己的伎俩。 “你会穿一件有点脏的衬衫，而你不会穿一件弄脏的衬衫。”妮可进来了，正在把阿贝的一个非凡的烟灰缸扔进垃圾桶，这时罗斯玛丽冲进了房间。

‘DICK! DICK! Come and see!’
‘迪克！迪克！来看看！'

Dick jogged across the hall into her room. He knelt to Peterson’s heart, and felt the pulse—the body was warm, the face, harassed and indirect in life, was gross and bitter in death; the box of materials was held under one arm but the shoe that dangled over the bedside was bare of polish and its sole was worn through. By French law Dick had no right to touch the body but he moved the arm a little to see something—there was a stain on the green coverlet, there would be faint blood on the blanket beneath.
迪克小跑穿过大厅，走进她的房间。他跪在彼得森的心脏前，摸着脉搏——身体温暖，面容在生时饱受折磨且含糊其辞，在死时则显得粗糙而痛苦；一只胳膊夹着一盒材料，但挂在床边的鞋子没有擦亮，鞋底也磨破了。根据法国法律，迪克无权触摸尸体，但他稍微移动了一下手臂，看到了一些东西——绿色的床单上有一个污点，下面的毯子上会有淡淡的血迹。

Dick closed the door and stood thinking; he heard cautious steps in the corridor and then Nicole calling him by name. Opening the door he whispered: ‘Bring the couverture and top blanket from one of our beds—don’t let any one see you.’ Then, noticing the strained look on her face, he added quickly, ‘Look here, you mustn’t get upset over this—it’s only some nigger scrap.’
迪克关上门，站在那里思考。他听到走廊里有小心翼翼的脚步声，然后妮可叫着他的名字。打开门，他低声说道：“把我们一张床上的糖衣和毯子拿过来——不要让任何人看到你。”然后，注意到她脸上紧张的表情，他很快补充道，“看这里，你不能”别为此感到不安——这只是一些黑鬼的废话。”

‘I want it to be over.’
“我希望一切都结束。”

The body, as Dick lifted it, was light and ill-nourished. He held it so that further hemorrhages from the wound would flow into the man’s clothes. Laying it beside the bed he stripped off the coverlet and top blanket and then opening the door an inch, listened—there was a clank of dishes down the hall followed by a loud patronizing ‘Mer-CI, Madame,’ but the waiter went in the other direction, toward the service stairway. Quickly Dick and Nicole exchanged bundles across the corridor; after spreading this covering on Rosemary’s bed, Dick stood sweating in the warm twilight, considering. Certain points had become apparent to him in the moment following his examination of the body; first, that Abe’s first hostile Indian had tracked the friendly Indian and discovered him in the corridor, and when the latter had taken desperate refuge in Rosemary’s room, had hunted down and slain him; second, that if the situation were allowed to develop naturally, no power on earth could keep the smear off Rosemary—the paint was scarcely dry on the Arbuckle case. Her contract was contingent upon an obligation to continue rigidly and unexceptionally as ‘Daddy’s Girl.’
迪克抬起尸体时，尸体很轻，而且营养不良。他握住伤口，让伤口的血进一步流到男人的衣服上。他把它放在床边，脱掉被单和上面的毯子，然后把门打开一英寸，听着——走廊里传来碗碟叮当作响的声音，然后是一声居高临下的大声“Mer-CI，女士”，但服务员走了进去另一个方向，朝向服务楼梯。迪克和妮可很快就穿过走廊交换了包裹。把这被子铺在罗斯玛丽的床上后，迪克在温暖的暮色中满头大汗地站在那儿思考。在检查尸体后的那一刻，他就明白了某些要点；首先，安倍的第一个敌对印第安人跟踪了友好的印第安人，并在走廊里发现了他，当后者在罗斯玛丽的房间里绝望地避难时，追捕并杀死了他；其次，如果任由情况自然发展，地球上没有任何力量可以阻止罗斯玛丽身上的污迹——阿巴克尔案上的油漆几乎还没有干。她的合同取决于她有义务继续严格、无例外地充当“爸爸的女儿”。

Automatically Dick made the old motion of turning up his sleeves though he wore a sleeveless undershirt, and bent over the body. Getting a purchase on the shoulders of the coat he kicked open the door with his heel, and dragged the body quickly into a plausible position in the corridor. He came back into Rosemary’s room and smoothed back the grain of the plush floor rug. Then he went to the phone in his suite and called the manager-owner of the hotel.
尽管迪克穿着一件无袖汗衫，但他还是自动做出了老套的动作，卷起袖子，弯下身子。他在外套肩上买了一件东西，用脚后跟踢开了门，然后把尸体迅速拖到走廊上一个合适的位置。他回到罗斯玛丽的房间，抚平毛绒地毯上的纹理。然后他拿起套房里的电话，给酒店的经理兼老板打了电话。

‘McBeth?—it’s Doctor Diver speaking—something very important. Are we on a more or less private line?’
“麦克贝斯？——是戴弗博士在说话——这是一件非常重要的事情。我们或多或少是在私人线路上吗？

It was good that he had made the extra effort which had firmly entrenched him with Mr. McBeth. Here was one use for all the pleasingness that Dick had expended over a large area he would never retrace... .
值得庆幸的是，他付出了额外的努力，这使他与麦克贝斯先生的关系更加牢固。迪克在一大片他永远不会回头的地方所花费的所有快乐的一个用途就是在这里……。

‘Going out of the suite we came on a dead Negro ... in the hall ... no, no, he’s a civilian. Wait a minute now—I knew you didn’t want any guests to blunder on the body so I’m phoning you. Of course I must ask you to keep my name out of it. I don’t want any French red tape just because I discovered the man.’
“走出套房，我们在大厅里遇到了一个死去的黑人……不，不，他是一个平民。等一下——我知道你不想让任何客人在尸体上犯错，所以我给你打电话。当然，我必须要求你不要提及我的名字。我不想因为我发现了这个人而受到法国的繁文缛节。

What exquisite consideration for the hotel! Only because Mr. McBeth, with his own eyes, had seen these traits in Doctor Diver two nights before, could he credit the story without question.
酒店考虑得多么周到啊！只是因为麦克贝斯先生在两天前亲眼看到了戴弗医生的这些特征，他才能毫无疑问地相信这个故事。

In a minute Mr. McBeth arrived and in another minute he was joined by a gendarme. In the interval he found time to whisper to Dick, ‘You can be sure the name of any guest will be protected. I’m only too grateful to you for your pains.’
过了一会儿，麦克贝斯先生就到了，又过了一会儿，一名宪兵也加入了他。在休息期间，他抽出时间对迪克低声说道：“你可以肯定，任何客人的名字都会受到保护。”我非常感谢你的痛苦。

Mr. McBeth took an immediate step that may only be imagined, but that influenced the gendarme so as to make him pull his mustaches in a frenzy of uneasiness and greed. He made perfunctory notes and sent a telephone call to his post. Meanwhile with a celerity that Jules Peterson, as a business man, would have quite understood, the remains were carried into another apartment of one of the most fashionable hotels in the world.
麦克贝斯先生立即采取了可能只能想象的步骤，但这影响了宪兵，使他在不安和贪婪的疯狂中拔掉了胡子。他敷衍了事地做了笔记，并给自己的岗位打了电话。与此同时，遗体以朱尔斯·彼得森（Jules Peterson）作为一名商人能够理解的速度被搬进了世界上最时尚的酒店之一的另一间公寓。

Dick went back to his salon.
迪克回到他的沙龙。

‘What HAP-pened?’ cried Rosemary. ‘Do all the Americans in Paris just shoot at each other all the time?’
“发生了什么？”罗斯玛丽喊道。 “巴黎的美国人总是互相开枪吗？”

‘This seems to be the open season,’ he answered. ‘Where’s Nicole?’
“这似乎是开放季节，”他回答道。 “妮可在哪儿？”

‘I think she’s in the bathroom.’
“我想她在浴室里。”

She adored him for saving her—disasters that could have attended upon the event had passed in prophecy through her mind; and she had listened in wild worship to his strong, sure, polite voice making it all right. But before she reached him in a sway of soul and body his attention focussed on something else: he went into the bedroom and toward the bathroom. And now Rosemary, too, could hear, louder and louder, a verbal inhumanity that penetrated the keyholes and the cracks in the doors, swept into the suite and in the shape of horror took form again.
她很崇拜他救了她——她的脑海里已经预言了可能会导致这件事的灾难；她怀着疯狂的崇拜之情聆听着他那有力、肯定、礼貌的声音，一切都好起来了。但在她以灵魂和身体的摇摆到达他面前之前，他的注意力集中在其他事情上：他走进卧室，走向浴室。现在，罗斯玛丽也能听到，越来越大的声音，一种不人道的言语穿过钥匙孔和门缝，席卷整个套房，再次以恐怖的形式出现。

With the idea that Nicole had fallen in the bathroom and hurt herself, Rosemary followed Dick. That was not the condition of affairs at which she stared before Dick shouldered her back and brusquely blocked her view.
罗斯玛丽以为妮可在浴室里摔倒受伤了，于是跟着迪克。在迪克推到她的背上并粗鲁地挡住她的视线之前，她所看到的情况并非如此。

Nicole knelt beside the tub swaying sidewise and sidewise. ‘It’s you!’ she cried, ‘—it’s you come to intrude on the only privacy I have in the world—with your spread with red blood on it. I’ll wear it for you—I’m not ashamed, though it was such a pity. On All Fools Day we had a party on the Zurichsee, and all the fools were there, and I wanted to come dressed in a spread but they wouldn’t let me—‘
妮可跪在浴缸旁边，身体左右摇摆。 “是你！”她喊道，“是你来侵犯我在这个世界上唯一的隐私——你的身上沾满了红色的血。”我给你戴上——我并不羞耻，虽然很遗憾。愚人节那天，我们在苏黎世湖举办了一场派对，所有的傻瓜都在那里，我想穿得漂漂亮亮的，但他们不让我——”

‘Control yourself!’
'控制住自己！'

‘—so I sat in the bathroom and they brought me a domino and said wear that. I did. What else could I do?’
’——所以我坐在浴室里，他们给我带来了一张多米诺骨牌，并说戴上它。我做到了。我还能做什么？

‘Control yourself, Nicole!’
“控制住自己，妮可！”

‘I never expected you to love me—it was too late—only don’t come in the bathroom, the only place I can go for privacy, dragging spreads with red blood on them and asking me to fix them.’
“我没想到你会爱我——已经太晚了——只是别进浴室，那是我唯一能去隐私的地方，拖着沾满红血的床单，要求我修理它们。”

‘Control yourself. Get up—‘
'控制住自己。起床-'

Rosemary, back in the salon, heard the bathroom door bang, and stood trembling: now she knew what Violet McKisco had seen in the bathroom at Villa Diana. She answered the ringing phone and almost cried with relief when she found it was Collis Clay, who had traced her to the Divers’ apartment. She asked him to come up while she got her hat, because she was afraid to go into her room alone.
罗斯玛丽回到沙龙，听到浴室门砰的一声，站在那里浑身发抖：现在她知道维奥莱特·麦基斯科在戴安娜别墅的浴室里看到了什么。她接听了铃声，当她发现是科利斯·克莱打来的电话时，她差点松了一口气，他已经追踪她到了戴弗夫妇的公寓。她让他在她拿帽子的时候上来，因为她害怕独自走进自己的房间。

第 2 册

I

In the spring of 1917, when Doctor Richard Diver first arrived in Zurich, he was twenty-six years old, a fine age for a man, indeed the very acme of bachelorhood. Even in war-time days, it was a fine age for Dick, who was already too valuable, too much of a capital investment to be shot off in a gun. Years later it seemed to him that even in this sanctuary he did not escape lightly, but about that he never fully made up his mind—in 1917 he laughed at the idea, saying apologetically that the war didn’t touch him at all. Instructions from his local board were that he was to complete his studies in Zurich and take a degree as he had planned.
1917年春天，理查德·戴弗医生第一次抵达苏黎世时，他二十六岁，对于一个男人来说是一个美好的年纪，确实是单身汉的巅峰。即使在战争时期，对于迪克来说，这也是一个美好的年纪，他已经太有价值了，资本投资太大了，不能用枪射掉。多年后，在他看来，即使在这个庇护所里，他也没有轻易逃脱，但对此他从未完全下定决心——1917年，他嘲笑了这个想法，抱歉地说，战争根本没有影响到他。当地董事会指示他按照计划在苏黎世完成学业并获得学位。

Switzerland was an island, washed on one side by the waves of thunder around Gorizia and on another by the cataracts along the Somme and the Aisne. For once there seemed more intriguing strangers than sick ones in the cantons, but that had to be guessed at—the men who whispered in the little cafés of Berne and Geneva were as likely to be diamond salesmen or commercial travellers. However, no one had missed the long trains of blinded or one-legged men, or dying trunks, that crossed each other between the bright lakes of Constance and Neuchâtel. In the beer-halls and shopwindows were bright posters presenting the Swiss defending their frontiers in 1914—with inspiring ferocity young men and old men glared down from the mountains at phantom French and Germans; the purpose was to assure the Swiss heart that it had shared the contagious glory of those days. As the massacre continued the posters withered away, and no country was more surprised than its sister republic when the United States bungled its way into the war.
瑞士是一座岛屿，一侧被戈里齐亚周围的雷电波冲刷，另一侧则被索姆河和埃纳河沿岸的瀑布冲刷。这一次，各州里的陌生人似乎比病人更有趣，但这必须猜测——在伯尔尼和日内瓦的小咖啡馆里窃窃私语的人很可能是钻石推销员或商务旅行者。然而，没有人错过一长串失明或独腿的人，或垂死的树干，它们在康斯坦茨和纳沙泰尔明亮的湖泊之间相互交叉。啤酒馆和商店橱窗里张贴着明亮的海报，展示了 1914 年瑞士人保卫边境的情景——年轻人和老人以鼓舞人心的凶猛态度从山上怒视着幽灵般的法国人和德国人；目的是让瑞士人相信他们曾分享过那些日子的富有感染力的荣耀。随着大屠杀的继续，海报逐渐消失，当美国笨手笨脚地卷入战争时，没有哪个国家比它的姐妹共和国更惊讶了。

Doctor Diver had seen around the edges of the war by that time: he was an Oxford Rhodes Scholar from Connecticut in 1914. He returned home for a final year at Johns Hopkins, and took his degree. In 1916 he managed to get to Vienna under the impression that, if he did not make haste, the great Freud would eventually succumb to an aeroplane bomb. Even then Vienna was old with death but Dick managed to get enough coal and oil to sit in his room in the Damenstiff Strasse and write the pamphlets that he later destroyed, but that, rewritten, were the backbone of the book he published in Zurich in 1920.
戴弗博士当时已经看到了战争的边缘：1914 年，他是来自康涅狄格州的牛津罗德学者。他回到家乡，在约翰·霍普金斯大学读了最后一年，并获得了学位。 1916 年，他成功抵达维也纳，心中留下的印象是，如果不抓紧时间，伟大的弗洛伊德最终会死于飞机炸弹袭击。即使在那时，维也纳也已因死亡而老去，但迪克还是设法弄到了足够的煤炭和石油，坐在达门斯蒂夫大街的房间里，写了一些小册子，后来他销毁了这些小册子，但这些小册子经过重写，成为了他 1997 年在苏黎世出版的那本书的主干。 1920年。

Most of us have a favorite, a heroic period, in our lives and that was Dick Diver’s. For one thing he had no idea that he was charming, that the affection he gave and inspired was anything unusual among healthy people. In his last year at New Haven some one referred to him as ‘lucky Dick’—the name lingered in his head.
我们大多数人的一生中都有一个最喜欢的英雄时期，那就是迪克·戴弗的时期。一方面，他不知道自己很有魅力，也不知道他所给予和激发的感情在健康人中是不寻常的。在纽黑文的最后一年，有人称他为“幸运的迪克”——这个名字一直萦绕在他的脑海中。

‘Lucky Dick, you big stiff,’ he would whisper to himself, walking around the last sticks of flame in his room. ‘You hit it, my boy. Nobody knew it was there before you came along.’
“幸运的迪克，你这个大笨蛋，”他绕着房间里最后的火苗走来走去，低声自言自语。 ‘你击中了，我的孩子。在你出现之前，没有人知道它在那里。

At the beginning of 1917, when it was becoming difficult to find coal, Dick burned for fuel almost a hundred textbooks that he had accumulated; but only, as he laid each one on the fire, with an assurance chuckling inside him that he was himself a digest of what was within the book, that he could brief it five years from now, if it deserved to be briefed. This went on at any odd hour, if necessary, with a floor rug over his shoulders, with the fine quiet of the scholar which is nearest of all things to heavenly peace— but which, as will presently be told, had to end.
1917年初，当煤炭变得越来越困难时，迪克烧掉了他积累的近百本教科书作为燃料；但只有当他把每一本书放在火上时，他内心咯咯地笑着保证，他自己就是这本书中内容的摘要，五年后他可以简报它，如果值得简报的话。如果有必要的话，这种情况会在任何奇怪的时间发生，他的肩膀上盖着一块地毯，带着学者般的安静，这最接近天堂般的平静——但正如我们即将讲述的那样，这种安静必须结束。

For its temporary continuance he thanked his body that had done the flying rings at New Haven, and now swam in the winter Danube. With Elkins, second secretary at the Embassy, he shared an apartment, and there were two nice girl visitors—which was that and not too much of it, nor too much of the Embassy either. His contact with Ed Elkins aroused in him a first faint doubt as to the quality of his mental processes; he could not feel that they were profoundly different from the thinking of Elkins—Elkins, who would name you all the quarterbacks in New Haven for thirty years.
他感谢自己的身体能暂时延续下去，它在纽黑文完成了飞环，现在又在冬天的多瑙河中游泳了。他和使馆二等秘书埃​​尔金斯合住一间公寓，还有两个漂亮的女孩来访——仅此而已，也不是太多，也不是大使馆的太多。与艾德·埃尔金斯的接触让他对自己的心理过程的质量产生了初步的怀疑。他感觉不出他们和埃尔金斯的想法有什么太大的不同——埃尔金斯会告诉你三十年来纽黑文所有四分卫的名字。

‘—And Lucky Dick can’t be one of these clever men; he must be less intact, even faintly destroyed. If life won’t do it for him it’s not a substitute to get a disease, or a broken heart, or an inferiority complex, though it’d be nice to build out some broken side till it was better than the original structure.’
“——幸运迪克不可能是这些聪明人中的一员；他肯定不太完整，甚至被轻微摧毁了。如果生活不能为他做到这一点，那么它就不能替代生病、破碎的心或自卑感，尽管建造一些破碎的一面会很好，直到它比原来的结构更好。

He mocked at his reasoning, calling it specious and ‘American’—his criteria of uncerebral phrase-making was that it was American. He knew, though, that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.
他嘲笑自己的推理，称其似是而非且“美国式”——他的无脑措辞的标准就是它是美国式的。但他知道，他的完整的代价就是不完整。

‘The best I can wish you, my child,’ so said the Fairy Blackstick in Thackeray’s The Rose and the Ring, ‘is a little misfortune.’
“我能给你最好的祝愿，我的孩子，”萨克雷的《玫瑰与指环》中的黑棒仙子如此说道，“就是一点点不幸。”

In some moods he griped at his own reasoning: Could I help it that Pete Livingstone sat in the locker-room Tap Day when everybody looked all over hell for him? And I got an election when otherwise I wouldn’t have got Elihu, knowing so few men. He was good and right and I ought to have sat in the locker-room instead. Maybe I would, if I’d thought I had a chance at an election. But Mercer kept coming to my room all those weeks. I guess I knew I had a chance all right, all right. But it would have served me right if I’d swallowed my pin in the shower and set up a conflict.
在某些情绪下，他对自己的推理感到不满：皮特·利文斯通坐在更衣室里踢球日，而每个人都在拼命寻找他，我能忍住吗？我得到了选举，否则我就不会有以利户了，因为我认识的人太少了。他说得很好，也很正确，我应该坐在更衣室里。如果我认为自己有机会参加选举的话，也许我会这么做。但那几周默瑟一直来我的房间。我想我知道我有机会，好吧，好吧。但如果我在淋浴时吞下别针并引起冲突，那对我来说是对的。

After the lectures at the university he used to argue this point with a young Rumanian intellectual who reassured him: ‘There’s no evidence that Goethe ever had a ‘conflict’ in the modern sense, or a man like Jung, for instance. You’re not a romantic philosopher— you’re a scientist. Memory, force, character—especially good sense. That’s going to be your trouble—judgment about yourself— once I knew a man who worked two years on the brain of an armadillo, with the idea that he would sooner or later know more about the brain of an armadillo than any one. I kept arguing with him that he was not really pushing out the extension of the human range—it was too arbitrary. And sure enough, when he sent his work to the medical journal they refused it—they had just accepted a thesis by another man on the same subject.’
大学讲座结束后，他常常与一位年轻的罗马尼亚知识分子争论这一点，这位知识分子向他保证：“没有证据表明歌德或像荣格这样的人曾经有过现代意义上的‘冲突’。”你不是一个浪漫的哲学家——你是一个科学家。记忆力、力量、性格——尤其是良好的判断力。一旦我认识一个人，他在犰狳的大脑上工作了两年，他认为他迟早会比任何人都更了解犰狳的大脑，这将是你的麻烦——对自己的判断。我一直和他争论，他并没有真正推动人类活动范围的延伸——这太武断了。果然，当他将自己的研究成果寄给医学杂志时，他们拒绝了——他们刚刚接受了另一个人关于同一主题的论文。

Dick got up to Zurich on less Achilles’ heels than would be required to equip a centipede, but with plenty—the illusions of eternal strength and health, and of the essential goodness of people; illusions of a nation, the lies of generations of frontier mothers who had to croon falsely, that there were no wolves outside the cabin door. After he took his degree, he received his orders to join a neurological unit forming in Bar-sur-Aube.
迪克到达苏黎世时，所面临的致命弱点比装备蜈蚣所需要的要少，但他却充满了对永恒力量和健康以及人性本质善良的幻想；一个国家的幻想，一代又一代边疆母亲的谎言，她们不得不错误地低吟着，以为小屋门外没有狼。获得学位后，他接到命令加入奥布河畔巴尔成立的神经科单位。

In France, to his disgust, the work was executive rather than practical. In compensation he found time to complete the short textbook and assemble the material for his next venture. He returned to Zurich in the spring of 1919 discharged.
令他厌恶的是，在法国，这项工作是执行性的，而不是实用性的。作为补偿，他抽出时间完成了这本简短的教科书，并为他的下一次冒险收集了材料。 1919 年春，他出院返回苏黎世。

The foregoing has the ring of a biography, without the satisfaction of knowing that the hero, like Grant, lolling in his general store in Galena, is ready to be called to an intricate destiny. Moreover it is confusing to come across a youthful photograph of some one known in a rounded maturity and gaze with a shock upon a fiery, wiry, eagle-eyed stranger. Best to be reassuring—Dick Diver’s moment now began.
前面的内容听起来像是一部传记，但我们并没有满意地知道，英雄就像格兰特一样，懒洋洋地躺在加利纳的杂货店里，准备好接受错综复杂的命运。此外，当你看到一张年轻时的照片时，你会感到很困惑，照片上的某个人圆润成熟，震惊地凝视着一个火热、精瘦、目光锐利的陌生人。最好让人放心——迪克·戴弗的时刻现在开始了。

II

It was a damp April day, with long diagonal clouds over the Albishorn and water inert in the low places. Zurich is not unlike an American city. Missing something ever since his arrival two days before, Dick perceived that it was the sense he had had in finite French lanes that there was nothing more. In Zurich there was a lot besides Zurich—the roofs upled the eyes to tinkling cow pastures, which in turn modified hilltops further up—so life was a perpendicular starting off to a postcard heaven. The Alpine lands, home of the toy and the funicular, the merry-go-round and the thin chime, were not a being HERE, as in France with French vines growing over one’s feet on the ground.
那是一个潮湿的四月天，阿尔比肖恩上空有长长的斜云，低处有水惰性。苏黎世与美国城市没有什么不同。自从两天前抵达以来，迪克就感觉错过了一些东西，他意识到这是他在有限的法国小巷中所感受到的，再也没有什么了。在苏黎世，除了苏黎世之外，还有很多东西——屋顶将人们的视线引向叮当作响的奶牛牧场，这反过来又改变了更高的山顶——所以生活是一条垂直的起点，通向明信片上的天堂。阿尔卑斯山的土地，玩具、缆索铁路、旋转木马和细细的编钟之乡，并不存在于这里，就像在法国，法国的藤蔓长满了人的脚。

In Salzburg once Dick had felt the superimposed quality of a bought and borrowed century of music; once in the laboratories of the university in Zurich, delicately poking at the cervical of a brain, he had felt like a toy-maker rather than like the tornado who had hurried through the old red buildings of Hopkins, two years before, unstayed by the irony of the gigantic Christ in the entrance hall.
在萨尔茨堡，迪克曾经感受到了一个世纪购买和借用的音乐的叠加品质；有一次在苏黎世大学的实验室里，他小心翼翼地戳了戳大脑的颈椎，他感觉自己像一个玩具制造商，而不是像两年前匆匆穿过霍普金斯古老的红色建筑的龙卷风，没有被对门厅里巨大的基督的讽刺。

Yet he had decided to remain another two years in Zurich, for he did not underestimate the value of toy-making, in infinite precision, of infinite patience.
但他决定在苏黎世再待两年，因为他并没有低估玩具制造的价值，即无限的精确度和无限的耐心。

To-day he went out to see Franz Gregorovius at Dohmler’s clinic on the Zurichsee. Franz, resident pathologist at the clinic, a Vaudois by birth, a few years older than Dick, met him at the tram stop. He had a dark and magnificent aspect of Cagliostro about him, contrasted with holy eyes; he was the third of the Gregoroviuses—his grandfather had instructed Krapaelin when psychiatry was just emerging from the darkness of all time. In personality he was proud, fiery, and sheeplike—he fancied himself as a hypnotist. If the original genius of the family had grown a little tired, Franz would without doubt become a fine clinician.
今天，他去苏黎世湖的多姆勒诊所看弗朗茨·格雷戈罗维乌斯。弗兰茨是诊所的驻院病理学家，出生于沃州，比迪克大几岁，他在电车站遇见了他。他身上有一种卡廖斯特罗的阴暗而壮丽的一面，与圣洁的眼睛形成鲜明对比。他是格雷戈罗维家族的第三代——当精神病学刚刚从有史以来的黑暗中崛起时，他的祖父指导了克拉帕林。在性格上，他骄傲、热情、像绵羊一样——他自认为是一名催眠师。如果这个家族原本的天才有点累了，弗兰茨无疑会成为一名优秀的临床医生。

On the way to the clinic he said: ‘Tell me of your experiences in the war. Are you changed like the rest? You have the same stupid and unaging American face, except I know you’re not stupid, Dick.’
在去诊所的路上，他说：“告诉我你在战争中的经历。”你也像其他人一样改变了吗？你有着同样愚蠢和不老的美国人面孔，但我知道你并不愚蠢，迪克。

‘I didn’t see any of the war—you must have gathered that from my letters, Franz.’
“我没有看到任何战争——你一定是从我的信中得知的，弗朗茨。”

‘That doesn’t matter—we have some shell-shocks who merely heard an air raid from a distance. We have a few who merely read newspapers.’
“这并不重要——我们有一些炮弹休克症患者，只是从远处听到了空袭的声音。我们有一些人只看报纸。

‘It sounds like nonsense to me.’
“这对我来说听起来像是无稽之谈。”

‘Maybe it is, Dick. But, we’re a rich person’s clinic—we don’t use the word nonsense. Frankly, did you come down to see me or to see that girl?’
“也许是这样，迪克。但是，我们是富人的诊所——我们不使用“废话”这个词。老实说，你是来看我的还是来看那个女孩的？

They looked sideways at each other; Franz smiled enigmatically.
他们互相看了看对方；弗兰茨神秘地笑了笑。

‘Naturally I saw all the first letters,’ he said in his official basso. ‘When the change began, delicacy prevented me from opening any more. Really it had become your case.’
“我自然看到了所有第一个字母，”他用官方低音说道。 “当变化开始时，美味让我无法再敞开心扉。真的，这已经成为你的案子了。

‘Then she’s well?’ Dick demanded.
“那她还好吗？”迪克问道。

‘Perfectly well, I have charge of her, in fact I have charge of the majority of the English and American patients. They call me Doctor Gregory.’
“很好，我负责她，事实上，我负责大多数英国和美国病人。他们叫我格雷戈里医生。

‘Let me explain about that girl,’ Dick said. ‘I only saw her one time, that’s a fact. When I came out to say good-by to you just before I went over to France. It was the first time I put on my uniform and I felt very bogus in it—went around saluting private soldiers and all that.’
“让我解释一下那个女孩，”迪克说。 “我只见过她一次，这是事实。当我去法国之前出来向你道别时。这是我第一次穿上制服，感觉很假——到处向私人士兵致敬之类的。”

‘Why didn’t you wear it to-day?’
“你今天为什么没穿它？”

‘Hey! I’ve been discharged three weeks. Here’s the way I happened to see that girl. When I left you I walked down toward that building of yours on the lake to get my bicycle.’
'嘿！我已经出院三周了。这就是我碰巧见到那个女孩的方式。当我离开你时，我朝你在湖边的那栋建筑走去，去拿我的自行车。

‘—toward the ‘Cedars’?’
“——去‘雪松’？”

‘—a wonderful night, you know—moon over that mountain—‘
“——一个美妙的夜晚，你知道——那座山上的月亮——”

‘The Krenzegg.’
“克伦泽格号。”

‘—I caught up with a nurse and a young girl. I didn’t think the girl was a patient; I asked the nurse about tram times and we walked along. The girl was about the prettiest thing I ever saw.’
”——我遇到了一名护士和一名年轻女孩。我不认为这个女孩是病人；她是个病人。我向护士询问了电车时间，然后我们就走了。这个女孩是我见过的最漂亮的东西。

‘She still is.’
“她仍然是。”

‘She’d never seen an American uniform and we talked, and I didn’t think anything about it.’ He broke off, recognizing a familiar perspective, and then resumed: ‘—except, Franz, I’m not as hardboiled as you are yet; when I see a beautiful shell like that I can’t help feeling a regret about what’s inside it. That was absolutely all—till the letters began to come.’
“她从来没有见过美国制服，我们聊了聊，我也没多想。”他突然停了下来，意识到这是一个熟悉的观点，然后继续说道：“——除了，弗兰茨，我不像她那样冷酷无情。”你还没有；当我看到这样美丽的贝壳时，我不禁对里面的东西感到遗憾。这绝对是全部——直到信件开始到来。

‘It was the best thing that could have happened to her,’ said Franz dramatically, ‘a transference of the most fortuitous kind. That’s why I came down to meet you on a very busy day. I want you to come into my office and talk a long time before you see her. In fact, I sent her into Zurich to do errands.’ His voice was tense with enthusiasm. ‘In fact, I sent her without a nurse, with a less stable patient. I’m intensely proud of this case, which I handled, with your accidental assistance.’
“这是发生在她身上的最好的事情，”弗兰兹戏剧性地说，“一种最偶然的移情。”这就是为什么我在非常忙碌的一天下来见你。我希望你能到我的办公室来谈一谈，然后再见到她。事实上，我派她去苏黎世办事。”他的声音紧张而充满热情。 “事实上，我在没有护士的情况下派她去，带着一位病情不太稳定的病人。我对这个案子感到非常自豪，在你意外的帮助下我处理了这个案子。”

The car had followed the shore of the Zurichsee into a fertile region of pasture farms and low hills, steepled with châlets. The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer.
汽车沿着苏黎世湖的海岸进入一片肥沃的地区，那里有牧场和低矮的山丘，山上矗立着小木屋。太阳游进了蔚蓝的天空海洋，突然之间，这里变成了瑞士山谷的最佳状态——令人愉悦的声音和低语，以及健康和欢乐的新鲜气味。

Professor Dohmler’s plant consisted of three old buildings and a pair of new ones, between a slight eminence and the shore of the lake. At its founding, ten years before, it had been the first modern clinic for mental illness; at a casual glance no layman would recognize it as a refuge for the broken, the incomplete, the menacing, of this world, though two buildings were surrounded with vine-softened walls of a deceptive height. Some men raked straw in the sunshine; here and there, as they rode into the grounds, the car passed the white flag of a nurse waving beside a patient on a path.
多姆勒教授的工厂由三座旧建筑和两座新建筑组成，位于一个轻微的高地和湖岸之间。十年前成立时，它是第一家现代精神疾病诊所；外行人乍一一看，不会认出它是这个世界破碎的、不完整的、充满威胁的避难所，尽管两座建筑的周围都是藤蔓软化的墙壁，其高度具有欺骗性。有些人在阳光下耙稻草；当他们驶进院子时，汽车时不时地经过一条小路上，一名护士在病人旁边挥舞着白旗。

After conducting Dick to his office, Franz excused himself for half an hour. Left alone Dick wandered about the room and tried to reconstruct Franz from the litter of his desk, from his books and the books of and by his father and grandfather; from the Swiss piety of a huge claret-colored photo of the former on the wall. There was smoke in the room; pushing open a French window, Dick let in a cone of sunshine. Suddenly his thoughts swung to the patient, the girl.
弗兰茨把迪克带到办公室后，就请假了半个小时。迪克独自一人在房间里走来走去，试图从他桌上的垃圾、他的书以及他父亲和祖父的书里重建弗兰茨；来自瑞士虔诚的前者在墙上挂着一张巨大的酒红色照片。房间里有烟；迪克推开一扇落地窗，让一缕阳光照进来。突然，他的思绪转向了病人，那个女孩。

He had received about fifty letters from her written over a period of eight months. The first one was apologetic, explaining that she had heard from America how girls wrote to soldiers whom they did not know. She had obtained the name and address from Doctor Gregory and she hoped he would not mind if she sometimes sent word to wish him well, etc., etc.
他收到了她在八个月内写的大约五十封信。第一个是抱歉的，解释说她从美国听说女孩们如何给不认识的士兵写信。她从格雷戈里医生那里得到了姓名和地址，她希望他不会介意她有时发话祝他一切顺利，等等。

So far it was easy to recognize the tone—from ‘Daddy-Long-Legs’ and ‘Molly-Make-Believe,’ sprightly and sentimental epistolary collections enjoying a vogue in the States. But there the resemblance ended.
到目前为止，我们很容易辨认出这种基调——来自《长腿爸爸》和《莫莉的假装相信》，这些活泼而感伤的书信集在美国很流行。但相似之处就到此为止了。

The letters were divided into two classes, of which the first class, up to about the time of the armistice, was of marked pathological turn, and of which the second class, running from thence up to the present, was entirely normal, and displayed a richly maturing nature. For these latter letters Dick had come to wait eagerly in the last dull months at Bar-sur-Aube—yet even from the first letters he had pieced together more than Franz would have guessed of the story.
这些信件分为两类，其中第一类，直到大约停战时，都有明显的病态转变，而第二类，从那时起到现在，是完全正常的，并显示出丰富成熟的本性。在奥布河畔巴尔最后的沉闷几个月里，迪克一直在热切地等待着后面的这些信——然而，即使从第一封信中，他拼凑出的内容也超出了弗朗茨对这个故事的猜测。

蒙船长：

I thought when I saw you in your uniform you were so handsome. Then I thought Je m’en fiche French too and German. You thought I was pretty too but I’ve had that before and a long time I’ve stood it. If you come here again with that attitude base and criminal and not even faintly what I had been taught to associate with the role of gentleman then heaven help you. However you seem quieter than the others,
当我看到你穿着制服时，我觉得你很帅。然后我想到了 Je m’en fiche 也有法语和德语。你也觉得我很漂亮，但我以前也有过这种情况，而且我已经忍受了很长时间了。如果你带着那种卑鄙和犯罪的态度再次来到这里，甚至没有隐约地感受到我被教导的与绅士角色相关的东西，那么上帝会帮助你。不过你看起来比其他人安静，

all soft like a big cat. I have only gotten to like boys who are rather sissies. Are you a sissy? There were some somewhere.
全身软软的，像一只大猫。我只喜欢比较娘娘腔的男孩。你是娘娘腔吗？某处有一些。

Excuse all this, it is the third letter I have written you and will send immediately or will never send. I’ve thought a lot about moonlight too, and there are many witnesses I could find if I could only be out of here.
请原谅这一切，这是我给您写的第三封信，将立即发送或永远不会发送。我也对月光想了很多，如果我能离开这里，我就能找到很多目击者。

They said you were a doctor, but so long as you are a cat it is different. My head aches so, so excuse this walking there like an ordinary with a white cat will explain, I think. I can speak three languages, four with English, and am sure I could be useful interpreting if you arrange such thing in France I’m sure I could control everything with the belts all bound around everybody like it was Wednesday. It is now Saturday and
他们说你是医生，但只要你是一只猫那就不一样了。我的头很疼，所以请原谅我像普通人带着一只白猫那样走到那里就可以解释了，我想。我会说三种语言，四种英语，并且如果你在法国安排这样的事情，我确信我可以提供有用的口译服务，我确信我可以控制一切，就像星期三一样，用皮带绑在每个人身上。现在是星期六，

you are far away, perhaps killed.
你在很远的地方，也许已经被杀了。

Come back to me some day, for I will be here always on this green hill. Unless they will let me write my father, whom I loved dearly. Excuse this. I am not myself today. I will write when I feel better.

CAPTAIN DIVER:
潜水员船长：

I know introspection is not good for a highly nervous state like mine, but I would like you to know where I stand. Last year or whenever it was in Chicago when I got so I couldn’t speak to servants or walk in the street I kept waiting for some one to tell me. It was the duty of some one who understood. The blind must be led. Only no one would tell me everything—they would just tell me half and I was already too muddled to put two and two together. One man was nice—he was a French officer and he understood. He gave me a flower and said it was ‘plus petite et
我知道内省对于像我这样高度紧张的状态来说并不好，但我想让你知道我的立场。去年或者每当我在芝加哥的时候，我无法与仆人交谈或走在街上，我一直在等待有人告诉我。这是理解者的责任。盲人必须被引导。只是没有人会告诉我一切——他们只会告诉我一半，而我已经太糊涂了，无法将两个和两个放在一起。有一个人很好——他是一名法国军官，他理解。他给了我一朵花，说这是“plus petite et”

moins entendue.’ We were friends. Then he took it away. I grew sicker and there was no one to explain to me. They had a song about Joan of Arc that they used to sing at me but that was just mean—it would just make me cry, for there was nothing the matter with my head then. They kept making reference to sports, too, but I didn’t care by that time. So there was that day I went walking on Michigan Boulevard on and on for miles and finally they followed me in an automobile, but I wouldn’t get
我们是朋友。然后他把它拿走了。我的病情越来越严重，却没有人向我解释。他们曾经对我唱过一首关于圣女贞德的歌，但这只是卑鄙的——它只会让我哭泣，因为那时我的头脑没有任何问题。他们也一直提到体育，但那时我已经不在乎了。所以有一天，我在密歇根大道上走了好几英里，最后他们开着汽车跟着我，但我不明白

(3)

in. Finally they pulled me in and there were nurses. After that time I began to realize it all, because I could feel what was happening in others. So you see how I stand. And what good can it be for me to stay here with the doctors harping constantly in the things I was here to get over. So today I have written my father to come and take me away. I am glad
最后他们把我拉了进去，还有护士。从那时起我开始意识到这一切，因为我能感觉到别人身上发生的事情。所以你看到我的立场了。医生们不断地喋喋不休地谈论我来这里是为了克服的事情，对我来说留在这里有什么好处呢？所以今天我写信给我父亲来接我走。我很高兴

(4)

you are so interested in examining people and sending them back. It must be so much fun.
您对检查人员并将其送回非常感兴趣。一定非常有趣。

And again, from another letter:
再次，来自另一封信：

You might pass up your next examination and write me a letter. They just sent me some phonograph records in case I should forget my lesson and I broke them all so the nurse won’t speak to me. They were in English, so that the nurses would not understand. One doctor in Chicago said I was bluffing, but what he really meant was that I was a twin six and he had never seen one before. But I was very busy being mad then, so I didn’t care what he said, when I am very busy being mad I don’t usually care what they say, not if I were a million girls.
你可能会通过下次考试并给我写一封信。他们只是给我发了一些留声机唱片，以防我忘记我的课，我把它们都打破了，这样护士就不会和我说话了。都是英文的，护士听不懂。芝加哥的一位医生说我在虚张声势，但他真正的意思是我是双胞胎六号，而他以前从未见过。但当时我正忙着生气，所以我不在乎他说什么，当我忙着生气时，我通常不在乎他们说什么，如果我是一百万个女孩，就不会在乎。

You told me that night you’d teach me to play. Well, I think love is all
那天晚上你告诉我你会教我弹奏。好吧，我认为爱就是一切

there is or should be. Anyhow I am glad your interest in examinations keeps you busy.
有或者应该有。不管怎样，我很高兴你对考试的兴趣让你忙碌起来。

There were other letters among whose helpless cæsuras lurked darker rhythms.
还有其他一些信件，其无助的停顿中潜藏着更黑暗的节奏。

DEAR CAPTAIN DIVER:
亲爱的潜水员船长：

I write to you because there is no one else to whom I can turn and it seems to me if this farcicle situation is apparent to one as sick as me it should be apparent to you. The mental trouble is all over and besides that I am completely broken and humiliated, if that was what they wanted. My family have shamefully neglected me, there’s no use asking them for help or pity. I have had enough and it is simply ruining my health and wasting my time pretending that what is the matter with my
我写信给你是因为我没有其他人可以向你求助，而且在我看来，如果这种闹剧的情况对于像我这样病态的人来说是显而易见的，那么对你来说也应该是显而易见的。精神上的麻烦已经过去了，除此之外，我完全崩溃了，受到了羞辱，如果那是他们想要的。我的家人可耻地忽视了我，向他们寻求帮助或怜悯是没有用的。我已经受够了，这只会毁掉我的健康，浪费我的时间假装我的身体出了什么问题。

(2)

head is curable.
头是可以治愈的。

Here I am in what appears to be a semi-insane-asylum, all because nobody saw fit to tell me the truth about anything. If I had only known what was going on like I know now I could have stood it I guess for I am pretty strong, but those who should have, did not see fit to enlighten me.
我现在身处一个看似半疯人院的地方，这一切都是因为没有人认为适合告诉我任何事情的真相。如果我知道发生了什么，就像我现在知道的那样，我想我可以忍受它，因为我相当坚强，但那些应该忍受的人却认为不适合启发我。

(3)

And now, when I know and have paid such a price for knowing, they sit there with their dogs lives and say I should believe what I did believe. Especially one does but I know now.
现在，当我知道并为知道付出这样的代价时，他们和他们的狗一样坐在那里，说我应该相信我所相信的。尤其是有人这样做，但我现在知道了。

I am lonesome all the time far away from friends and family across the Atlantic I roam all over the place in a half daze. If you could get me a position as interpreter (I know French and German like a native, fair
我一直很孤独，远离大西洋彼岸的朋友和家人，茫然地到处流浪。如果你能给我一个口译员的职位（我像当地人一样懂法语和德语，公平

Italian and a little Spanish) or in the Red Cross Ambulance or as a trained nurse, though I would have to train you would prove a great blessing.
意大利语和一点西班牙语）或在红十字救护车或作为一名训练有素的护士，尽管我必须培训你，这将是一个巨大的祝福。

And again:
然后再次：

Since you will not accept my explanation of what is the matter you could at least explain to me what you think, because you have a kind cat’s face, and not that funny look that seems to be so fashionable here. Dr. Gregory gave me a snapshot of you, not as handsome as you are in your uniform, but younger looking.
既然你不接受我的解释，你至少可以向我解释一下你的想法，因为你有一张善良的猫脸，而不是这里流行的那种滑稽的表情。格雷戈里医生给了我一张你的快照，不像你穿制服时那么英俊，但看起来更年轻。

MON CAPITAINE:
蒙船长：

It was fine to have your postcard. I am so glad you take such interest in disqualifying nurses—oh, I understood your note very well indeed. Only I thought from the moment I met you that you were different.
能收到你的明信片真是太好了。我很高兴你对取消护士资格如此感兴趣——哦，我确实很好地理解了你的留言。只是我从遇见你的那一刻起就觉得你与众不同。

DEAR CAPITAINE:
亲爱的船长：

I think one thing today and another tomorrow. That is really all that’s the matter with me, except a crazy defiance and a lack of proportion. I would gladly welcome any alienist you might suggest. Here they lie in their bath tubs and sing Play in Your Own Backyard as if I had my

After that the letters were fewer, but he answered them all. There was one:
后来信少了，但他都回了。有一个：

I wish someone were in love with me like boys were ages ago before I was sick. I suppose it will be years, though, before I could think of anything like that.
我希望有人像我生病之前很久以前的男孩一样爱我。不过，我想我可能要过很多年才能想到这样的事情。

But when Dick’s answer was delayed for any reason, there was a fluttering burst of worry—like a worry of a lover: ‘Perhaps I have bored you,’ and: ‘Afraid I have presumed,’ and: ‘I keep thinking at night you have been sick.’
但当迪克因为某种原因迟迟没有答复时，一阵忧虑突然袭来——就像情人的忧虑：“也许我让你感到无聊”，“恐怕我已经猜到了”，“我晚上一直在想”。你病了。

In actuality Dick was sick with the flu. When he recovered, all except the formal part of his correspondence was sacrificed to the consequent fatigue, and shortly afterward the memory of her became overlaid by the vivid presence of a Wisconsin telephone girl at headquarters in Bar-sur-Aube. She was red-lipped like a poster, and known obscenely in the messes as ‘The Switchboard.’
事实上迪克得了流感。当他康复后，除了正式的通信部分之外，所有的信件都因随之而来的疲劳而被牺牲了，不久之后，对她的记忆就被奥布河畔巴尔总部一位威斯康星州电话女孩的生动形象所覆盖。她红唇如海报，在混乱中被下流地称为“总机”。

Franz came back into his office feeling self-important. Dick thought he would probably be a fine clinician, for the sonorous or staccato cadences by which he disciplined nurse or patient came not from his nervous system but from a tremendous and harmless vanity. His true emotions were more ordered and kept to himself.
弗兰茨回到办公室，感到很自以为是。迪克认为他可能会成为一名优秀的临床医生，因为他用来训练护士或病人的响亮或断断续续的节奏不是来自他的神经系统，而是来自巨大而无害的虚荣心。他的真实情感更加井井有条，并且不为人知。

‘Now about the girl, Dick,’ he said. ‘Of course, I want to find out about you and tell you about myself, but first about the girl, because I have been waiting to tell you about it so long.’
“现在说说那个女孩，迪克，”他说。 “当然，我想了解你并告诉你我自己，但首先是关于那个女孩，因为我已经等了很久才想告诉你这件事。”

He searched for and found a sheaf of papers in a filing cabinet but after shuffling through them he found they were in his way and put them on his desk. Instead he told Dick the story.
他在文件柜里寻找并发现了一叠文件，但在翻阅它们后，他发现它们妨碍了他，就把它们放在了桌子上。相反，他把这个故事告诉了迪克。

三、

About a year and a half before, Doctor Dohmler had some vague correspondence with an American gentleman living in Lausanne, a Mr. Devereux Warren, of the Warren family of Chicago. A meeting was arranged and one day Mr. Warren arrived at the clinic with his daughter Nicole, a girl of sixteen. She was obviously not well and the nurse who was with her took her to walk about the grounds while Mr. Warren had his consultation.
大约一年半之前，多姆勒医生与一位住在洛桑的美国绅士、芝加哥沃伦家族的德弗罗·沃伦先生有过一些模糊的通信。安排了一次会面，有一天沃伦先生带着他十六岁的女儿妮可来到诊所。她显然身体不太好，沃伦先生就诊时，陪着她的护士带她在院子里散步。

Warren was a strikingly handsome man looking less than forty. He was a fine American type in every way, tall, broad, well-made—‘un homme très chic,’ as Doctor Dohmler described him to Franz. His large gray eyes were sun-veined from rowing on Lake Geneva, and he had that special air about him of having known the best of this world. The conversation was in German, for it developed that he had been educated at Göttingen. He was nervous and obviously very moved by his errand.
沃伦是一位非常英俊的男人，看上去还不到四十岁。他在各个方面都是典型的美国人，身材高大、宽阔、身材精良——正如多姆勒医生向弗朗茨描述的那样，“非常时尚的男人”。他那双灰色的大眼睛因在日内瓦湖上划船而泛出阳光般的纹理，他身上有一种特殊的气质，仿佛他知道这个世界上最好的东西。谈话是用德语进行的，因为据了解他曾在哥廷根接受过教育。他很紧张，显然对他的任务很感动。

‘Doctor Dohmler, my daughter isn’t right in the head. I’ve had lots of specialists and nurses for her and she’s taken a couple of rest cures but the thing has grown too big for me and I’ve been strongly recommended to come to you.’
“多姆勒医生，我女儿脑子不太正常。我为她请了很多专家和护士，她也接受了几次休息治疗，但事情对我来说太大了，所以强烈建议我来找你。

‘Very well,’ said Doctor Dohmler. ‘Suppose you start at the beginning and tell me everything.’
“很好，”多姆勒医生说。 “假设你从头开始，告诉我一切。”

‘There isn’t any beginning, at least there isn’t any insanity in the family that I know of, on either side. Nicole’s mother died when she was eleven and I’ve sort of been father and mother both to her, with the help of governesses—father and mother both to her.’
“据我所知，这家人没有任何开始，至少双方都没有任何精神错乱。”妮可的母亲在她十一岁时去世，在家庭女教师的帮助下，我既是她的父亲又是她的母亲——对她来说既是父亲又是母亲。

He was very moved as he said this. Doctor Dohmler saw that there were tears in the corners of his eyes and noticed for the first time that there was whiskey on his breath.
说这话时，他非常感动。多姆勒医生看到他眼角有泪水，第一次注意到他的呼吸里有威士忌的味道。

‘As a child she was a darling thing—everybody was crazy about her, everybody that came in contact with her. She was smart as a whip and happy as the day is long. She liked to read or draw or dance or play the piano—anything. I used to hear my wife say she was the only one of our children who never cried at night. I’ve got an older girl, too, and there was a boy that died, but Nicole was— Nicole was—Nicole—‘
“小时候，她是一个可爱的人——每个人都为她疯狂，每个与她接触过的人。她聪明如鞭，快乐如白昼。她喜欢读书、画画、跳舞或弹钢琴——任何事情。我曾经听我妻子说她是我们孩子中唯一一个晚上不哭的人。我也有一个年纪较大的女孩，还有一个男孩死了，但妮可——妮可——妮可——”

He broke off and Doctor Dohmler helped him.
他停了下来，多姆勒医生帮助了他。

‘She was a perfectly normal, bright, happy child.’
“她是一个完全正常、聪明、快乐的孩子。”

‘Perfectly.’
'完美。'

Doctor Dohmler waited. Mr. Warren shook his head, blew a long sigh, glanced quickly at Doctor Dohmler and then at the floor again.
多姆勒医生等待着。沃伦先生摇摇头，长长地叹了口气，快速地看了一眼多姆勒医生，然后又看了一眼地板。

‘About eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago or maybe ten—I try to figure but I can’t remember exactly where we were when she began to do funny things—crazy things. Her sister was the first one to say anything to me about it—because Nicole was always the same to me,’ he added rather hastily, as if some one had accused him of being to blame, ‘—the same loving little girl. The first thing was about a valet.’
“大约八个月前，或者六个月前，或者十个月前——我试图弄清楚，但我记不清当她开始做有趣的事情——疯狂的事情时，我们到底在哪里。她的姐姐是第一个对我说这件事的人——因为妮可对我来说总是一样的，”他相当匆忙地补充道，就好像有人指责他应该受到责备一样，“——同一个可爱的小女孩。第一件事是关于代客泊车的。

‘Oh, yes,’ said Doctor Dohmler, nodding his venerable head, as if, like Sherlock Holmes, he had expected a valet and only a valet to be introduced at this point.
“哦，是的，”多姆勒医生说道，点着他那令人尊敬的头，仿佛他像夏洛克·福尔摩斯一样，期待着一个男仆，而且此时只会介绍一个男仆。

‘I had a valet—been with me for years—Swiss, by the way.’ He looked up for Doctor Dohmler’s patriotic approval. ‘And she got some crazy idea about him. She thought he was making up to her—of course, at the time I believed her and I let him go, but I know now it was all nonsense.’
“我有一个贴身男仆——陪伴了我很多年——顺便说一句，是瑞士人。”他抬头寻求多姆勒医生爱国的认可。 “她对他有了一些疯狂的想法。她认为他在向她和解——当然，当时我相信了她，我让他走了，但我现在知道这都是无稽之谈。

‘What did she claim he had done?’
“她声称他做了什么？”

‘That was the first thing—the doctors couldn’t pin her down. She just looked at them as if they ought to know what he’d done. But she certainly meant he’d made some kind of indecent advances to her—she didn’t leave us in any doubt of that.’
“这是第一件事——医生无法确定她的病情。她只是看着他们，好像他们应该知道他做了什么。但她的意思肯定是他对她做出了某种不雅的举动——她没有让我们对此产生任何怀疑。

‘I see.’
'我懂了。'

‘Of course, I’ve read about women getting lonesome and thinking there’s a man under the bed and all that, but why should Nicole get such an idea? She could have all the young men she wanted. We were in Lake Forest—that’s a summer place near Chicago where we have a place—and she was out all day playing golf or tennis with boys. And some of them pretty gone on her at that.’
“当然，我读过关于女人变得孤独并认为床底下有一个男人之类的故事，但妮可为什么会有这样的想法呢？她可以拥有所有她想要的年轻人。我们在森林湖——那是芝加哥附近的一个避暑胜地，我们在那儿有一个地方——她整天都在外面和男孩们打高尔夫球或打网球。其中一些人对此非常厌恶。

All the time Warren was talking to the dried old package of Doctor Dohmler, one section of the latter’s mind kept thinking intermittently of Chicago. Once in his youth he could have gone to Chicago as fellow and docent at the university, and perhaps become rich there and owned his own clinic instead of being only a minor shareholder in a clinic. But when he had thought of what he considered his own thin knowledge spread over that whole area, over all those wheat fields, those endless prairies, he had decided against it. But he had read about Chicago in those days, about the great feudal families of Armour, Palmer, Field, Crane, Warren, Swift, and McCormick and many others, and since that time not a few patients had come to him from that stratum of Chicago and New York.
在沃伦与多姆勒医生的干燥旧包裹交谈的整个过程中，后者大脑的一部分一直断断续续地想起芝加哥。在他年轻的时候，他本可以去芝加哥作为大学的研究员和讲解员，也许在那里变得富有并拥有自己的诊所，而不仅仅是一家诊所的小股东。但当他想到他认为自己单薄的知识遍布整个地区、所有那些麦田、那些一望无际的大草原时，他决定不这样做。但那时他读过有关芝加哥的故事，读过阿穆尔、帕尔默、菲尔德、克兰、沃伦、斯威夫特、麦考密克等封建大家族的故事，从那时起，不少来自这个阶层的病人来找他。芝加哥和纽约。

‘She got worse,’ continued Warren. ‘She had a fit or something— the things she said got crazier and crazier. Her sister wrote some of them down—‘ He handed a much-folded piece of paper to the doctor. ‘Almost always about men going to attack her, men she knew or men on the street—anybody—‘
“她的情况变得更糟了，”沃伦继续说道。 “她突然发作了，或者发生了什么事——她说的话变得越来越疯狂。她姐姐写下了其中一些——”他把一张折叠得很厉害的纸递给医生。 “几乎总是关于男人要攻击她，她认识的男人或街上的男人——任何人——”

He told of their alarm and distress, of the horrors families go through under such circumstances, of the ineffectual efforts they had made in America, finally of the faith in a change of scene that had made him run the submarine blockade and bring his daughter to Switzerland.
他讲述了他们的惊慌和痛苦，讲述了家庭在这种情况下所经历的恐怖，讲述了他们在美国所做的徒劳的努力，最后讲述了对环境变化的信念，这使得他执行了潜艇封锁，并把他的女儿带到了美国。瑞士。

‘—on a United States cruiser,’ he specified with a touch of hauteur. ‘It was possible for me to arrange that, by a stroke of luck. And, may I add,’ he smiled apologetically, ‘that as they say: money is no object.’
“——在一艘美国巡洋舰上，”他傲慢地指出。 “如果我运气好的话，是有可能做到这一点的。而且，我可以补充一下，”他抱歉地微笑着，“正如他们所说：金钱不是问题。”

‘Certainly not,’ agreed Dohmler dryly.
“当然不是，”多姆勒干巴巴地表示同意。

He was wondering why and about what the man was lying to him. Or, if he was wrong about that, what was the falsity that pervaded the whole room, the handsome figure in tweeds sprawling in his chair with a sportsman’s ease? That was a tragedy out there, in the February day, the young bird with wings crushed somehow, and inside here it was all too thin, thin and wrong.
他想知道这个人为什么要对他撒谎，以及撒谎的目的是什么。或者，如果他的想法是错的，那么整个房间里弥漫着的虚假是什么，穿着粗花呢的英俊身影以运动员般的轻松姿势躺在椅子上？外面那是一场悲剧，在二月的一天，那只长着翅膀的幼鸟不知何故被压碎了，而这里却太瘦弱了，瘦弱了，错误的。

‘I would like—to talk to her—a few minutes now,’ said Doctor Dohmler, going into English as if it would bring him closer to Warren.
“我想——现在就和她谈谈——几分钟，”多姆勒医生用英语说道，仿佛这样可以拉近他与沃伦的距离。

Afterward when Warren had left his daughter and returned to Lausanne, and several days had passed, the doctor and Franz entered upon Nicole’s card:
后来，当沃伦离开女儿回到洛桑，几天过去了，医生和弗朗茨进入了妮可的名片：

Diagnostic: Schizophrénie. Phase aiguë en décroissance. La peur des hommes est un symptôme de la maladie, et n’est point constitutionnelle... . Le pronostic doit rester réservé.*
诊断：精神分裂症。阶段 aiguë en décroissance。人类是疾病的症状，也是宪法的重点…… Le pronostic doit Rester servé.*

* Diagnosis: Divided Personality. Acute and down-hill phase of the illness. The fear of men is a symptom of the illness and is not at all constitutional... . The prognosis must be reserved.
* 诊断：人格分裂。疾病的急性期和衰退期。对男人的恐惧是疾病的症状，根本不符合体质……。预测必须保留。

And then they waited with increasing interest as the days passed for Mr. Warren’s promised second visit.
随着时间一天天过去，他们越来越感兴趣地等待着沃伦先生承诺的第二次来访。

It was slow in coming. After a fortnight Doctor Dohmler wrote. Confronted with further silence he committed what was for those days ‘une folie,’ and telephoned to the Grand Hotel at Vevey. He learned from Mr. Warren’s valet that he was at the moment packing to sail for America. But reminded that the forty francs Swiss for the call would show up on the clinic books, the blood of the Tuileries Guard rose to Doctor Dohmler’s aid and Mr. Warren was got to the phone.
它来得很慢。两周后，多姆勒医生写道。面对进一步的沉默，他说了当时的“une folie”，并打电话到沃韦的大酒店。他从沃伦先生的贴身男仆那里得知，他现在正在收拾行李，准备乘船前往美国。但有人提醒，四十瑞士法郎的通话费用将出现在诊所账簿上，杜乐丽卫兵的热血沸腾了，向多姆勒医生伸出援手，沃伦先生接了电话。

‘It is—absolutely necessary—that you come. Your daughter’s health—all depends. I can take no responsibility.’
“你来是——绝对必要的。”您女儿的健康状况——一切都取决于您。我不承担任何责任。

‘But look here, Doctor, that’s just what you’re for. I have a hurry call to go home!’
“但是你看这里，医生，这正是你的目的。我有急事要回家！

Doctor Dohmler had never yet spoken to any one so far away but he dispatched his ultimatum so firmly into the phone that the agonized American at the other end yielded. Half an hour after this second arrival on the Zurichsee, Warren had broken down, his fine shoulders shaking with awful sobs inside his easy fitting coat, his eyes redder than the very sun on Lake Geneva, and they had the awful story.
多姆勒医生还从来没有和这么远的地方的人说过话，但他在电话里发出的最后通牒是如此坚定，以至于电话那头痛苦的美国人屈服了。第二次到达苏黎世湖半小时后，沃伦崩溃了，他那漂亮的肩膀在他那件合身的外套里抽泣着，颤抖着，他的眼睛比日内瓦湖上的太阳还要红，他们就发生了这个可怕的故事。

‘It just happened,’ he said hoarsely. ‘I don’t know—I don’t know.
“事情就这样发生了，”他沙哑地说。 “我不知道——我不知道。

‘After her mother died when she was little she used to come into my bed every morning, sometimes she’d sleep in my bed. I was sorry for the little thing. Oh, after that, whenever we went places in an automobile or a train we used to hold hands. She used to sing to me. We used to say, ‘Now let’s not pay any attention to anybody else this afternoon—let’s just have each other—for this morning you’re mine.’’ A broken sarcasm came into his voice. ‘People used to say what a wonderful father and daughter we were—they used to wipe their eyes. We were just like lovers—and then all at once we were lovers—and ten minutes after it happened I could have shot myself—except I guess I’m such a Goddamned degenerate I didn’t have the nerve to do it.’
“她小时候母亲去世后，她每天早上都会到我的床上来，有时她会睡在我的床上。我为这件小事感到抱歉。噢,从那以后,每当我们坐汽车或火车去某个地方时,我们都会手牵着手。她曾经唱歌给我听。我们常常说，“现在，今天下午我们不要理会任何人——我们只管彼此——因为今天早上你就是我的了。”他的声音里带着断断续续的讽刺。 “人们过去常常说我们是一对多么棒的父女——他们常常擦眼泪。我们就像恋人一样——然后我们突然成为恋人——事情发生十分钟后我就可以开枪自杀了——只是我想我是个该死的堕落者，我没有勇气这么做。

‘Then what?’ said Doctor Dohmler, thinking again of Chicago and of a mild pale gentleman with a pince-nez who had looked him over in Zurich thirty years before. ‘Did this thing go on?’
“然后呢？”多姆勒医生说道，他又想起了芝加哥，想起了三十年前在苏黎世给他做过检查的一位带着夹鼻眼镜的温和苍白的绅士。 “这件事还有继续吗？”

‘Oh, no! She almost—she seemed to freeze up right away. She’d just say, ‘Never mind, never mind, Daddy. It doesn’t matter. Never mind.’’
'不好了！她几乎——她似乎立刻就僵住了。她只会说：‘没关系，没关系，爸爸。没关系。没关系。''

‘There were no consequences?’
“没有什么后果吗？”

‘No.’ He gave one short convulsive sob and blew his nose several times. ‘Except now there’re plenty of consequences.’
“不。”他抽搐着抽泣了一阵，擤了几次鼻子。 “但现在会有很多后果。”

As the story concluded Dohmler sat back in the focal armchair of the middle class and said to himself sharply, ‘Peasant!’—it was one of the few absolute worldly judgments that he had permitted himself for twenty years. Then he said:
故事结束时，多姆勒坐在中产阶级的焦点扶手椅上，尖锐地对自己说：“农民！”——这是二十年来他允许自己做出的为数不多的绝对世俗的判断之一。然后他说：

‘I would like for you to go to a hotel in Zurich and spend the night and come see me in the morning.’
“我想让你去苏黎世的一家酒店住一晚，早上再来见我。”

‘And then what?’
'然后什么？'

Doctor Dohmler spread his hands wide enough to carry a young pig.
多姆勒医生张开双手，足以抱起一头小猪。

‘Chicago,’ he suggested.
“芝加哥，”他建议道。

IV

‘Then we knew where we stood,’ said Franz. ‘Dohmler told Warren we would take the case if he would agree to keep away from his daughter indefinitely, with an absolute minimum of five years. After Warren’s first collapse, he seemed chiefly concerned as to whether the story would ever leak back to America.’
“然后我们就知道我们所处的位置了，”弗朗茨说。 “多姆勒告诉沃伦，如果他同意无限期（绝对至少五年）远离他的女儿，我们就会受理此案。沃伦第一次崩溃后，他似乎主要担心这个故事是否会泄露回美国。

‘We mapped out a routine for her and waited. The prognosis was bad—as you know, the percentage of cures, even so-called social cures, is very low at that age.’
“我们为她制定了一套日程，然后等待。预后很糟糕——如你所知，在那个年龄，治愈的百分比，甚至所谓的社会治愈，都非常低。

‘Those first letters looked bad,’ agreed Dick.
“那些第一封信看起来很糟糕，”迪克同意道。

‘Very bad—very typical. I hesitated about letting the first one get out of the clinic. Then I thought it will be good for Dick to know we’re carrying on here. It was generous of you to answer them.’
“非常糟糕——非常典型。我犹豫着要不要让第一个病人离开诊所。然后我想迪克知道我们在这里继续下去会有好处。你很慷慨地回答了他们。

Dick sighed. ‘She was such a pretty thing—she enclosed a lot of snapshots of herself. And for a month there I didn’t have anything to do. All I said in my letters was ‘Be a good girl and mind the doctors.’’
迪克叹了口气。 “她是一个非常漂亮的人——她附上了很多自己的照片。在那里的一个月里我没有任何事可做。我在信中只说“做一个好女孩，注意医生。”

‘That was enough—it gave her somebody to think of outside. For a while she didn’t have anybody—only one sister that she doesn’t seem very close to. Besides, reading her letters helped us here— they were a measure of her condition.’
“这就足够了——这让她有了一个可以思考外面的人。有一段时间，她没有任何人，只有一个她似乎不太亲近的妹妹。此外，读她的信对我们也有帮助——它们是衡量她状况的标准。”

‘I’m glad.’
'我很高兴。'

‘You see now what happened? She felt complicity—that’s neither here nor there, except as we want to revalue her ultimate stability and strength of character. First came this shock. Then she went off to a boarding-school and heard the girls talking—so from sheer self-protection she developed the idea that she had had no complicity—and from there it was easy to slide into a phantom world where all men, the more you liked them and trusted them, the more evil—‘
‘你现在明白发生了什么了吗？她感到自己是同谋——这种感觉不存在，除非我们想重新评估她最终的稳定性和性格力量。首先是这种震惊。然后她去了一所寄宿学校，听到女孩们在说话——所以出于纯粹的自我保护，她产生了自己没有同谋的想法——从那里开始，她很容易滑入一个幻影世界，那里所有的男人，甚至更多你喜欢他们并且信任他们，他们越邪恶——”

‘Did she ever go into the—horror directly?’
“她有没有直接陷入——恐怖之中？”

‘No, and as a matter of fact when she began to seem normal, about October, we were in a predicament. If she had been thirty years old we would have let her make her own adjustment, but she was so young we were afraid she might harden with it all twisted inside her. So Doctor Dohmler said to her frankly, ‘Your duty now is to yourself. This doesn’t by any account mean the end of anything for you—your life is just at its beginning,’ and so forth and so forth. She really has an excellent mind, so he gave her a little Freud to read, not too much, and she was very interested. In fact, we’ve made rather a pet of her around here. But she is reticent,’ he added; he hesitated: ‘We have wondered if in her recent letters to you which she mailed herself from Zurich, she has said anything that would be illuminating about her state of mind and her plans for the future.’
“不，事实上，当她开始看起来正常时，大约是十月份，我们就陷入了困境。如果她三十岁了，我们会让她自己调整，但她太年轻了，我们担心她会因为内心的扭曲而变得坚强。于是多姆勒医生就坦白地对她说：“你现在的责任就是你自己。”这对你来说并不意味着任何事情的结束——你的生活才刚刚开始，等等。她确实有一个优秀的头脑，所以他给了她一点弗洛伊德读，但不是太多，她很感兴趣。事实上，我们已经把她当成宠物了。但她很沉默寡言，”他补充道。他犹豫了一下：“我们想知道，在她最近从苏黎世亲自寄给您的信中，她是否说了一些能够说明她的心态和未来计划的事情。”

Dick considered.
迪克想了想。

‘Yes and no—I’ll bring the letters out here if you want. She seems hopeful and normally hungry for life—even rather romantic. Sometimes she speaks of ‘the past’ as people speak who have been in prison. But you never know whether they refer to the crime or the imprisonment or the whole experience. After all I’m only a sort of stuffed figure in her life.’
“是的，也不是——如果你愿意的话，我可以把信拿出来。”她看起来充满希望，通常对生活充满渴望——甚至相当浪漫。有时她谈到“过去”就像入狱的人一样。但你永远不知道它们指的是犯罪、监禁还是整个经历。毕竟我只是她生活中的一个填充人物。

‘Of course, I understand your position exactly, and I express our gratitude once again. That was why I wanted to see you before you see her.’
“当然，我完全理解你的立场，我再次表示感谢。这就是为什么我想在你见到她之前先见见你。

Dick laughed.
迪克笑了。

‘You think she’s going to make a flying leap at my person?’
“你觉得她会向我扑来吗？”

‘No, not that. But I want to ask you to go very gently. You are attractive to women, Dick.’
‘不，不是那样。但我想请你轻轻地走。你对女人很有吸引力，迪克。”

‘Then God help me! Well, I’ll be gentle and repulsive—I’ll chew garlic whenever I’m going to see her and wear a stubble beard. I’ll drive her to cover.’
‘那么上帝帮助我吧！好吧，我会表现得温柔而令人厌恶——每当我要见她时，我都会嚼大蒜，留着胡茬。我会开车送她去掩护。

‘Not garlic!’ said Franz, taking him seriously. ‘You don’t want to compromise your career. But you’re partly joking.’
“不是大蒜！”弗兰茨严肃地对待他说道。 ‘你不想损害你的职业生涯。但你部分是在开玩笑。

‘—and I can limp a little. And there’s no real bathtub where I’m living, anyhow.’
’——我可以稍微跛行一点。无论如何，我住的地方没有真正的浴缸。

‘You’re entirely joking,’ Franz relaxed—or rather assumed the posture of one relaxed. ‘Now tell me about yourself and your plans?’
“你完全是在开玩笑，”弗朗茨放松下来——或者更确切地说，摆出一副放松的姿势。 “现在告诉我你自己和你的计划吗？”

‘I’ve only got one, Franz, and that’s to be a good psychologist— maybe to be the greatest one that ever lived.’
“我只有一​​个目标，弗兰茨，那就是成为一名优秀的心理学家——也许是有史以来最伟大的心理学家。”

Franz laughed pleasantly, but he saw that this time Dick wasn’t joking.
弗兰兹愉快地笑了，但他看出迪克这次不是在开玩笑。

‘That’s very good—and very American,’ he said. ‘It’s more difficult for us.’ He got up and went to the French window. ‘I stand here and I see Zurich—there is the steeple of the GrossMünster. In its vault my grandfather is buried. Across the bridge from it lies my ancestor Lavater, who would not be buried in any church. Nearby is the statue of another ancestor, Heinrich Pestalozzi, and one of Doctor Alfred Escher. And over everything there is always Zwingli—I am continually confronted with a pantheon of heroes.’
“这非常好——而且非常美国化，”他说。 “这对我们来说更困难。”他起身走到落地窗前。 “我站在这里，看到了苏黎世——那里有大明斯特大教堂的尖塔。我的祖父埋葬在它的墓穴里。桥对面躺着我的祖先拉瓦特，他不会被埋葬在任何教堂里。附近有另一位祖先海因里希·裴斯塔洛齐 (Heinrich Pestalozzi) 和阿尔弗雷德·埃舍尔 (Alfred Escher) 博士的雕像。在一切之上，慈运理总是存在——我不断地面对着英雄万神殿。

‘Yes, I see.’ Dick got up. ‘I was only talking big. Everything’s just starting over. Most of the Americans in France are frantic to get home, but not me—I draw military pay all the rest of the year if I only attend lectures at the university. How’s that for a government on the grand scale that knows its future great men? Then I’m going home for a month and see my father. Then I’m coming back—I’ve been offered a job.’
“是的，我明白了。”迪克站了起来。 “我只是在说大话。一切才刚刚开始。大多数在法国的美国人都急于回家，但我不是——如果我只在大学听课，我在这一年剩下的时间里都会领取军饷。对于一个了解未来伟人的庞大政府来说，情况如何？然后我要回家一个月，看看我的父亲。然后我就回来了——有人给我提供了一份工作。”

‘Where?’
'在哪里？'

‘Your rivals—Gisler’s Clinic on Interlacken.’
“你的竞争对手——因特拉肯的吉斯勒诊所。”

‘Don’t touch it,’ Franz advised him. ‘They’ve had a dozen young men there in a year. Gisler’s a manic-depressive himself, his wife and her lover run the clinic—of course, you understand that’s confidential.’
“别碰它，”弗兰兹劝告他。 “一年里他们有十几个年轻人在那里。吉斯勒本人就是一名躁狂抑郁症患者，他的妻子和她的情人经营着这家诊所——当然，你知道这是保密的。

‘How about your old scheme for America?’ asked Dick lightly. ‘We were going to New York and start an up-to-date establishment for billionaires.’
“你对美国的旧计划怎么样？”迪克轻声问道。 “我们要去纽约，为亿万富翁开设一家最新的酒店。”

‘That was students’ talk.’
“那是学生们的谈话。”

Dick dined with Franz and his bride and a small dog with a smell of burning rubber, in their cottage on the edge of the grounds, He felt vaguely oppressed, not by the atmosphere of modest retrenchment, nor by Frau Gregorovius, who might have been prophesied, but by the sudden contracting of horizons to which Franz seemed so reconciled. For him the boundaries of asceticism were differently marked—he could see it as a means to an end, even as a carrying on with a glory it would itself supply, but it was hard to think of deliberately cutting life down to the scale of an inherited suit. The domestic gestures of Franz and his wife as they turned in a cramped space lacked grace and adventure. The post-war months in France, and the lavish liquidations taking place under the ægis of American splendor, had affected Dick’s outlook. Also, men and women had made much of him, and perhaps what had brought him back to the centre of the great Swiss watch, was an intuition that this was not too good for a serious man.
迪克和弗兰兹、他的新娘以及一只散发着烧橡胶味的小狗一起在他们位于场地边缘的小屋里吃饭。预言了，但弗兰茨似乎很愿意接受地平线的突然收缩。对他来说，禁欲主义的界限有不同的标记——他可以将其视为达到目的的一种手段，甚至将其视为一种对其本身提供的荣耀的延续，但很难想象故意将生活削减到一种规模。继承的套装。弗朗茨和他的妻子在狭窄的空间里转身时的家​​庭姿态缺乏优雅和冒险。法国战后的几个月，以及在美国辉煌的庇护下进行的大规模清算，影响了迪克的前景。此外，男人和女人都对他很看重，也许让他回到伟大瑞士手表中心的原因是一种直觉：这对于一个严肃的男人来说不太好。

He made Kaethe Gregorovius feel charming, meanwhile becoming increasingly restless at the all-pervading cauliflower— simultaneously hating himself too for this incipience of he knew not what superficiality.
他让凯西·格雷戈罗维乌斯感到迷人，同时对无处不在的花椰菜变得越来越不安——同时也讨厌自己，因为他不知道自己的肤浅。

‘God, am I like the rest after all?’—So he used to think starting awake at night—‘Am I like the rest?’
“上帝啊，我到底和其他人一样吗？”——所以他常常在晚上醒来时想——“我和其他人一样吗？”

This was poor material for a socialist but good material for those who do much of the world’s rarest work. The truth was that for some months he had been going through that partitioning of the things of youth wherein it is decided whether or not to die for what one no longer believes. In the dead white hours in Zurich staring into a stranger’s pantry across the upshine of a streetlamp, he used to think that he wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit it in.
对于社会主义者来说，这不是很好的材料，但对于那些从事世界上最稀有工作的人来说却是很好的材料。事实上，几个月来，他一直在经历青春期事物的划分，在这个过程中，他决定是否为不再相信的事情而死。在苏黎世的死白时刻，他透过路灯的照耀凝视着一个陌生人的食品储藏室，他曾经以为他想要做好人，他想要善良，他想要勇敢和明智，但这一切都非常困难。他也希望被爱，如果他能融入的话。

The veranda of the central building was illuminated from open French windows, save where the black shadows of stripling walls and the fantastic shadows of iron chairs slithered down into a gladiola bed. From the figures that shuffled between the rooms Miss Warren emerged first in glimpses and then sharply when she saw him; as she crossed the threshold her face caught the room’s last light and brought it outside with her. She walked to a rhythm—all that week there had been singing in her ears, summer songs of ardent skies and wild shade, and with his arrival the singing had become so loud she could have joined in with it.
中央建筑的阳台被敞开的落地窗照亮，除了年轻墙壁的黑色阴影和铁椅的奇妙阴影滑落到一张剑兰床上。沃伦小姐从房间里来回走动的人影中首先瞥见了他，然后在看到他时猛然出现。当她跨过门槛时，她的脸捕捉到了房间里最后的光，并把它带到了外面。她按照节奏行走——整个星期，她的耳边都在唱歌，夏天的歌声充满了热情的天空和狂野的树荫，随着他的到来，歌声变得如此响亮，她可以加入其中。

‘How do you do, Captain,’ she said, unfastening her eyes from his with difficulty, as though they had become entangled. ‘Shall we sit out here?’ She stood still, her glance moving about for a moment. ‘It’s summer practically.’
“你好，船长，”她说，艰难地把目光从他的身上移开，仿佛它们已经纠缠在一起了。 “我们要坐在这里吗？”她一动不动地站着，目光四处移动了一会儿。 “现在已经是夏天了。”

A woman had followed her out, a dumpy woman in a shawl, and Nicole presented Dick: ‘Señora—‘
一个女人跟着她出去了，一个披着围巾的矮胖女人，妮可向迪克介绍道：“夫人——”

Franz excused himself and Dick grouped three chairs together.
弗朗兹告辞了，迪克把三把椅子放在一起。

‘The lovely night,’ the Señora said.
“美好的夜晚，”夫人说。

‘Muy bella,’ agreed Nicole; then to Dick, ‘Are you here for a long time?’
“太好了，”妮可同意道。然后对迪克说：“你在这里待了很长时间吗？”

‘I’m in Zurich for a long time, if that’s what you mean.’
“我在苏黎世待了很长时间，如果你是这个意思的话。”

‘This is really the first night of real spring,’ the Señora suggested.
“这确实是真正春天的第一个夜晚，”夫人建议道。

‘To stay?’
“留下来？”

‘At least till July.’
“至少到七月。”

‘I’m leaving in June.’
“我六月就要离开。”

‘June is a lovely month here,’ the Señora commented. ‘You should stay for June and then leave in July when it gets really too hot.’
“六月是这里的美好月份，”夫人评论道。 “你应该待六月，然后在七月天气变得太热时离开。”

‘You’re going where?’ Dick asked Nicole.
“你要去哪里？”迪克问妮可。

‘Somewhere with my sister—somewhere exciting, I hope, because I’ve lost so much time. But perhaps they’ll think I ought to go to a quiet place at first—perhaps Como. Why don’t you come to Como?’
“和我姐姐一起去某个令人兴奋的地方，我希望，因为我已经浪费了太多时间。但也许他们会认为我应该首先去一个安静的地方——也许是科莫。你为什么不来科莫？

‘Ah, Como—‘ began the Señora.
“啊，科莫——”夫人开口说道。

Within the building a trio broke into Suppe’s ‘Light Cavalry.’ Nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the impression of her youth and beauty grew on Dick until it welled up inside him in a compact paroxysm of emotion. She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.
大楼内，三人闯入了苏佩的“轻骑兵”。妮可趁机站了起来，迪克对她青春美丽的印象越来越深，直到一种强烈的情感爆发在他内心深处。她笑了，那是动人的孩子气的笑容，就像世间所有逝去的青春。

‘The music’s too loud to talk against—suppose we walk around. Buenas noches, Señora.’
“音乐声太大了，无法反对——假设我们四处走动。 Buenas noches，夫人。

‘G’t night—g’t night.’
“晚安——晚安。”

They went down two steps to the path—where in a moment a shadow cut across it. She took his arm.
他们下了两级台阶，来到了小路上——刹那间，一道阴影横亘在小路上。她抓住了他的手臂。

‘I have some phonograph records my sister sent me from America,’ she said. ‘Next time you come here I’ll play them for you—I know a place to put the phonograph where no one can hear.’
“我有一些姐姐从美国寄给我的留声机唱片，”她说。 “下次你来这里时，我会为你播放它们——我知道一个可以把留声机放在没人能听到的地方。”

‘That’ll be nice.’
“那就太好了。”

‘Do you know ‘Hindustan’?’ she asked wistfully. ‘I’d never heard it before, but I like it. And I’ve got ‘Why Do They Call Them Babies?’ and ‘I’m Glad I Can Make You Cry.’ I suppose you’ve danced to all those tunes in Paris?’
“你知道‘印度斯坦’吗？”她若有所思地问道。 “我以前从未听过，但我喜欢它。我还写了《为什么他们称他们为宝贝？》和《我很高兴能让你哭》。我想你在巴黎都随着这些曲子跳舞过吧？

‘I haven’t been to Paris.’
“我没去过巴黎。”

Her cream-colored dress, alternately blue or gray as they walked, and her very blonde hair, dazzled Dick—whenever he turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting up like an angel’s when they came into the range of a roadside arc. She thanked him for everything, rather as if he had taken her to some party, and as Dick became less and less certain of his relation to her, her confidence increased—there was that excitement about her that seemed to reflect all the excitement of the world.
她的奶油色裙子，随着他们的脚步，时而蓝色时而灰色，她的金发让迪克眼花缭乱——每当他转向她时，她都会微微一笑，当他们进入路边的范围时，她的脸像天使一样闪闪发光。弧。她感谢他所做的一切，就好像他带她去参加某个聚会一样，随着迪克越来越不确定他和她的关系，她的信心增强了——她身上有一种兴奋，似乎反映了整个聚会的所有兴奋。世界。

‘I’m not under any restraint at all,’ she said. ‘I’ll play you two good tunes called ‘Wait Till the Cows Come Home’ and ‘Good-by, Alexander.’’
“我根本没有受到任何限制，”她说。 “我会为你播放两首好听的曲子，分别是《等到奶牛回家》和《再见，亚历山大》。”

He was late the next time, a week later, and Nicole was waiting for him at a point in the path which he would pass walking from Franz’s house. Her hair drawn back of her ears brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to have just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment when she was coming from a wood into clear moonlight. The unknown yielded her up; Dick wished she had no background, that she was just a girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come. They went to the cache where she had left the phonograph, turned a corner by the workshop, climbed a rock, and sat down behind a low wall, facing miles and miles of rolling night.
一周后，他第二次迟到了，妮可在他从弗兰兹家步行经过的小路上的某个地方等他。她的头发梳到耳后，拂过肩膀，脸庞仿佛刚刚从头发中露出来，仿佛这正是她从树林中走入清澈月光的时刻。未知的事物让她屈服了；迪克希望她没有背景，她只是一个迷失的女孩，除了她来的那天晚上之外，没有地址。他们去了她留下留声机的储藏室，在车间旁拐了个弯，爬上一块岩石，在一堵矮墙后面坐下，面对绵延数英里的滚滚夜色。

They were in America now, even Franz with his conception of Dick as an irresistible Lothario would never have guessed that they had gone so far away. They were so sorry, dear; they went down to meet each other in a taxi, honey; they had preferences in smiles and had met in Hindustan, and shortly afterward they must have quarrelled, for nobody knew and nobody seemed to care—yet finally one of them had gone and left the other crying, only to feel blue, to feel sad.
他们现在在美国，即使是弗兰兹，他认为迪克是一个不可抗拒的色狼，也不会猜到他们已经走了这么远。亲爱的，他们非常抱歉；亲爱的，他们下楼去坐出租车见面。他们都喜欢微笑，在印度斯坦相识，不久之后他们肯定吵架了，因为没有人知道，似乎也没有人关心——但最后他们中的一个走了，留下另一个在哭泣，只感到忧郁、悲伤。

The thin tunes, holding lost times and future hopes in liaison, twisted upon the Valais night. In the lulls of the phonograph a cricket held the scene together with a single note. By and by Nicole stopped playing the machine and sang to him.
轻柔的曲调，承载着逝去的时光和未来的希望，在瓦莱州的夜晚扭曲。在留声机的寂静中，一只蟋蟀用一个音符将整个场景凝聚在一起。渐渐地，妮可不再玩机器了，开始唱歌给他听。

“Lay a silver dollar
“放下一枚银元

On the ground
在地上

And watch it roll
并看着它滚动

Because it’s round—‘
因为它是圆的——’

On the pure parting of her lips no breath hovered. Dick stood up suddenly.
她的嘴唇纯粹地分开，没有一丝呼吸。迪克突然站了起来。

‘What’s the matter, you don’t like it?’
“怎么了，你不喜欢这样吗？”

‘Of course I do.’
'我当然是了。'

‘Our cook at home taught it to me:
“我们家里的厨师教我的：

“A woman never knows
“女人永远不知道

What a good man she’s got
她有一个多么好的男人

Till after she turns him down ...’
直到她拒绝他之后……”

‘You like it?’
'你喜欢它？'

She smiled at him, making sure that the smile gathered up everything inside her and directed it toward him, making him a profound promise of herself for so little, for the beat of a response, the assurance of a complimentary vibration in him. Minute by minute the sweetness drained down into her out of the willow trees, out of the dark world.
她对他微笑，确保这个微笑聚集了她内心的一切，并将其引向他，让他对自己做出了深刻的承诺，只需要一点点回应，保证他体内有一种互补的振动。一分钟一分钟地，甜蜜从柳树里、从黑暗的世界里流进她的体内。

She stood up too, and stumbling over the phonograph, was momentarily against him, leaning into the hollow of his rounded shoulder.
她也站起来，被留声机绊倒，暂时靠在他身上，靠在他圆肩的凹陷处。

‘I’ve got one more record,’ she said. ‘—Have you heard ‘So Long, Letty’? I suppose you have.’
“我还有一张唱片，”她说。 ”——你听过《再见，莱蒂》吗？我想你有。

‘Honestly, you don’t understand—I haven’t heard a thing.’
“老实说，你不明白——我什么也没听到。”

Nor known, nor smelt, nor tasted, he might have added; only hotcheeked girls in hot secret rooms. The young maidens he had known at New Haven in 1914 kissed men, saying ‘There!’, hands at the man’s chest to push him away. Now there was this scarcely saved waif of disaster bringing him the essence of a continent... .
他可能会补充说，不知道，也没有闻过，也没有尝过；只有热气腾腾的秘密房间里的厚脸皮女孩。 1914 年，他在纽黑文认识的年轻少女一边亲吻男人，一边说“好了！”，并用手按住男人的胸口将他推开。现在，这个几乎没有挽救的灾难流浪者给他带来了大陆的本质……。

VI

It was May when he next found her. The luncheon in Zurich was a council of caution; obviously the logic of his life tended away from the girl; yet when a stranger stared at her from a nearby table, eyes burning disturbingly like an uncharted light, he turned to the man with an urbane version of intimidation and broke the regard.
当他再次找到她时，已经是五月了。苏黎世的午餐会是一次谨慎的会议。显然，他的生活逻辑已经远离了那个女孩。然而，当附近桌子上的一个陌生人盯着她，眼睛像未知的光一样令人不安地燃烧时，他以一种温文尔雅的恐吓态度转向那个男人，打断了这种目光。

‘He was just a peeper,’ he explained cheerfully. ‘He was just looking at your clothes. Why do you have so many different clothes?’
“他只是个偷看者，”他高兴地解释道。 “他只是在看你的衣服。你为什么有这么多不同的衣服？

‘Sister says we’re very rich,’ she offered humbly. ‘Since Grandmother is dead.’
“姐姐说我们很有钱。”她谦虚地说道。 “因为祖母死了。”

‘I forgive you.’
'我原谅你。'

He was enough older than Nicole to take pleasure in her youthful vanities and delights, the way she paused fractionally in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant, so that the incorruptible quicksilver could give her back to herself. He delighted in her stretching out her hands to new octaves now that she found herself beautiful and rich. He tried honestly to divorce her from any obsession that he had stitched her together—glad to see her build up happiness and confidence apart from him; the difficulty was that, eventually, Nicole brought everything to his feet, gifts of sacrificial ambrosia, of worshipping myrtle.
他比妮可年长，能够欣赏她年轻时的虚荣心和快乐，她在离开餐厅时在大厅镜子前稍稍停顿的样子，以便永不腐蚀的水银可以让她回归自我。既然她发现自己既美丽又富有，他很高兴她将双手伸向新的八度。他诚实地试图让她摆脱他将她缝合在一起的任何痴迷——很高兴看到她在离开他之后建立起幸福和自信；困难在于，最终，妮可把一切都带到了他的脚下，献祭圣水的礼物，崇拜香桃木的礼物。

The first week of summer found Dick re-established in Zurich. He had arranged his pamphlets and what work he had done in the Service into a pattern from which he intended to make his revise of ‘A Psychology for Psychiatrists.’ He thought he had a publisher; he had established contact with a poor student who would iron out his errors in German. Franz considered it a rash business, but Dick pointed out the disarming modesty of the theme.
夏季的第一周，迪克在苏黎世重新安顿下来。他把他的小册子和他在服务部门所做的工作整理成一种模式，打算以此为基础修订《精神病学家心理学》。他与一位穷学生建立了联系，这位学生可以纠正他的德语错误。弗朗茨认为这是一件鲁莽的事情，但迪克指出这个主题令人消除戒心的谦虚。

‘This is stuff I’ll never know so well again,’ he insisted. ‘I have a hunch it’s a thing that only fails to be basic because it’s never had material recognition. The weakness of this profession is its attraction for the man a little crippled and broken. Within the walls of the profession he compensates by tending toward the clinical, the ‘practical’—he has won his battle without a struggle.
“我再也不会这么了解这些事情了，”他坚持说。 “我有一种预感，这只是一件不基础的事情，因为它从未得到过物质上的认可。这个职业的弱点在于它对那些有点残废和破碎的人有吸引力。在职业的围墙内，他通过倾向于临床、“实用”来弥补——他不费吹灰之力就赢得了战斗。

‘On the contrary, you are a good man, Franz, because fate selected you for your profession before you were born. You better thank God you had no ‘bent’—I got to be a psychiatrist because there was a girl at St. Hilda’s in Oxford that went to the same lectures. Maybe I’m getting trite but I don’t want to let my current ideas slide away with a few dozen glasses of beer.’
“相反，你是一个好人，弗兰茨，因为命运在你出生之前就选择了你从事你的职业。你最好感谢上帝，你没有“弯曲”——我之所以成为一名精神科医生，是因为牛津圣希尔达学院有一个女孩参加了同样的讲座。也许我有点老套了，但我不想让我当前的想法随着几十杯啤酒而消失。

‘All right,’ Franz answered. ‘You are an American. You can do this without professional harm. I do not like these generalities. Soon you will be writing little books called ‘Deep Thoughts for the Layman,’ so simplified that they are positively guaranteed not to cause thinking. If my father were alive he would look at you and grunt, Dick. He would take his napkin and fold it so, and hold his napkin ring, this very one—‘ he held it up, a boar’s head was carved in the brown wood—‘and he would say, ‘Well my impression is—‘ then he would look at you and think suddenly ‘What is the use?’ then he would stop and grunt again; then we would be at the end of dinner.’
“好吧，”弗兰兹回答道。 ‘你是美国人。您可以在不造成职业伤害的情况下做到这一点。我不喜欢这些笼统的说法。很快你就会写出名为《外行人的深刻思考》的小书，这些书是如此简单，以至于肯定不会引起思考。如果我父亲还活着，他会看着你咕哝一声，迪克。他会拿起他的餐巾，把它折叠起来，然后握住他的餐巾环，就是这个——”他举起它，棕色的木头上刻着一个野猪头——“然后他会说，“嗯，我的印象是——”然后他会看着你突然想到“这有什么用？”然后他会停下来再次咕哝；然后我们就吃完晚饭了。

‘I am alone to-day,’ said Dick testily. ‘But I may not be alone to-morrow. After that I’ll fold up my napkin like your father and grunt.’
“今天我一个人，”迪克暴躁地说。 “但明天我可能不再孤单了。之后我会像你父亲一样折叠起餐巾并咕哝着。

Franz waited a moment.
弗兰茨等了一会儿。

‘How about our patient?’ he asked.
“我们的病人怎么样？”他问道。

‘I don’t know.’
'我不知道。'

‘Well, you should know about her by now.’
“好吧，你现在应该了解她了。”

‘I like her. She’s attractive. What do you want me to do—take her up in the edelweiss?’
'我喜欢她。她很有吸引力。你想让我做什么——用雪绒花带她上去？

‘No, I thought since you go in for scientific books you might have an idea.’
“不，我想既然你喜欢科学书籍，你可能会有想法。”

‘—devote my life to her?’
“——把我的一生奉献给她？”

Franz called his wife in the kitchen: ‘Du lieber Gott! Bitte, bringe Dick noch ein Glas-Bier.’
弗朗茨在厨房里喊他的妻子：“Du lieber Gott！”比特，给迪克带来玻璃啤酒。

‘I don’t want any more if I’ve got to see Dohmler.’
“如果我必须见多姆勒，我就不想再见面了。”

‘We think it’s best to have a program. Four weeks have passed away—apparently the girl is in love with you. That’s not our business if we were in the world, but here in the clinic we have a stake in the matter.’
“我们认为最好有一个计划。四个星期过去了——显然这个女孩爱上了你。如果我们在世界上，那不是我们的事，但在诊所里，我们与这件事利害攸关。

‘I’ll do whatever Doctor Dohmler says,’ Dick agreed.
“我会按照多姆勒医生的吩咐去做，”迪克同意道。

But he had little faith that Dohmler would throw much light on the matter; he himself was the incalculable element involved. By no conscious volition of his own, the thing had drifted into his hands. It reminded him of a scene in his childhood when everyone in the house was looking for the lost key to the silver closet, Dick knowing he had hid it under the handkerchiefs in his mother’s top drawer; at that time he had experienced a philosophical detachment, and this was repeated now when he and Franz went together to Professor Dohmler’s office.
但他不太相信多姆勒会对此事有更多的了解。他本人就是其中不可估量的因素。不知不觉间，那东西就到了他的手里。这让他想起童年时的一个场景，当时家里的每个人都在寻找丢失的银色衣柜钥匙，迪克知道他把它藏在了母亲最上面抽屉的手帕下面；那时他经历了一种哲学上的超然，现在当他和弗兰兹一起去多姆勒教授的办公室时，这种情况又再次出现。

The professor, his face beautiful under straight whiskers, like a vine-overgrown veranda of some fine old house, disarmed him. Dick knew some individuals with more talent, but no person of a class qualitatively superior to Dohmler.
教授解除了他的武装，他的脸在笔直的胡须下显得很漂亮，就像某座精美老房子里藤蔓丛生的阳台。迪克认识一些更有才华的人，但没有一个人的素质比多姆勒更优秀。

—Six months later he thought the same way when he saw Dohmler dead, the light out on the veranda, the vines of his whiskers tickling his stiff white collar, the many battles that had swayed before the chink-like eyes stilled forever under the frail delicate lids—
——六个月后，当他看到多姆勒死去时，他也有同样的想法，阳台上的灯灭了，他胡须的藤蔓使他僵硬的白领发痒，在那双缝隙般的眼睛之前摇摆的许多战斗在虚弱的目光下永远静止了。精致的盖子——

‘... Good morning, sir.’ He stood formally, thrown back to the army.
“……早上好，长官。”他正式站起来，回到了军队。

Professor Dohmler interlaced his tranquil fingers. Franz spoke in terms half of liaison officer, half of secretary, till his senior cut through him in mid-sentence.
多姆勒教授平静地十指交扣。弗兰兹说话的语气一半是联络官，一半是秘书，直到他的上级在半句话中打断了他。

‘We have gone a certain way,’ he said mildly. ‘It’s you, Doctor Diver, who can best help us now.’
“我们已经走了一条路，”他温和地说。 “戴弗博士，现在最能帮助我们的是你。”

Routed out, Dick confessed: ‘I’m not so straight on it myself.’
被击败后，迪克承认：“我自己也不是那么直率。”

‘I have nothing to do with your personal reactions,’ said Dohmler. ‘But I have much to do with the fact that this so-called ‘transference,’’ he darted a short ironic look at Franz which the latter returned in kind, ‘must be terminated. Miss Nicole does well indeed, but she is in no condition to survive what she might interpret as a tragedy.’
“我与你的个人反应无关，”多姆勒说。 “但我对这个事实有很大关系，这种所谓的‘移情’，”他向弗兰兹投了一个简短的讽刺眼神，弗兰兹也以同样的方式回应，“必须终止。”妮可小姐确实做得很好，但她无法幸存，她可能会认为这是一场悲剧。

Again Franz began to speak, but Doctor Dohmler motioned him silent.
弗朗兹又开始说话，但多姆勒医生示意他安静。

‘I realize that your position has been difficult.’
“我意识到你的处境很困难。”

‘Yes, it has.’
“是的，确实如此。”

Now the professor sat back and laughed, saying on the last syllable of his laughter, with his sharp little gray eyes shining through: ‘Perhaps you have got sentimentally involved yourself.’
现在教授坐下来笑了，笑到最后一个音节时，他那双锐利的灰色小眼睛闪闪发光：“也许你自己也陷入了感情之中。”

Aware that he was being drawn on, Dick, too, laughed.
意识到自己被利用了，迪克也笑了。

‘She’s a pretty girl—anybody responds to that to a certain extent. I have no intention—‘
“她是一个漂亮的女孩——任何人都会在某种程度上对此做出反应。我无意——”

Again Franz tried to speak—again Dohmler stopped him with a question directed pointedly at Dick. ‘Have you thought of going away?’
弗朗茨再次试图说话——多姆勒再次用一个尖锐的问题阻止了他，直接针对迪克。 “你想过离开吗？”

‘I can’t go away.’
“我不能离开。”

Doctor Dohmler turned to Franz: ‘Then we can send Miss Warren away.’
多姆勒医生转向弗朗兹：“那么我们就可以送沃伦小姐离开了。”

‘As you think best, Professor Dohmler,’ Dick conceded. ‘It’s certainly a situation.’
“正如你所想的那样，多姆勒教授。”迪克承认道。 “这确实是一种情况。”

Professor Dohmler raised himself like a legless man mounting a pair of crutches.
多姆勒教授像一个拄着拐杖的无腿人一样站了起来。

‘But it is a professional situation,’ he cried quietly.
“但这是一个职业情况，”他轻声喊道。

He sighed himself back into his chair, waiting for the reverberating thunder to die out about the room. Dick saw that Dohmler had reached his climax, and he was not sure that he himself had survived it. When the thunder had diminished Franz managed to get his word in.
他叹了一口气，靠回椅子上，等待房间里回荡的雷声平息。迪克看到多姆勒已经达到了高潮，但他不确定自己是否能挺过高潮。当雷声减弱后，弗兰茨设法兑现了他的诺言。

‘Doctor Diver is a man of fine character,’ he said. ‘I feel he only has to appreciate the situation in order to deal correctly with it. In my opinion Dick can co-operate right here, without any one going away.’
“戴弗医生是一个品格优良的人，”他说。 “我觉得他只有认识到目前的情况才能正确处理。在我看来，迪克可以在这里进行合作，无需任何人离开。

‘How do you feel about that?’ Professor Dohmler asked Dick.
“你对此有何感想？”多姆勒教授问迪克。

Dick felt churlish in the face of the situation; at the same time he realized in the silence after Dohmler’s pronouncement that the state of inanimation could not be indefinitely prolonged; suddenly he spilled everything.
面对这种情况，迪克感到很无礼。与此同时，在多姆勒宣布之后的沉默中，他意识到死气沉沉的状态不可能无限期地延长。突然他把所有的东西都洒了出来。

‘I’m half in love with her—the question of marrying her has passed through my mind.’
“我已经半爱她了——娶她的问题已经在我脑海中闪过了。”

‘Tch! Tch!’ uttered Franz.
‘切！切！”弗朗兹喊道。

‘Wait.’ Dohmler warned him. Franz refused to wait: ‘What! And devote half your life to being doctor and nurse and all—never! I know what these cases are. One time in twenty it’s finished in the first push—better never see her again!’
“等等。”多姆勒警告他。弗朗兹不肯等待：“什么！把你的半生奉献给医生、护士等等——永远不要！我知道这些情况是什么。二十分之一的事情在第一次推动时就完成了——最好再也不要见到她了！

‘What do you think?’ Dohmler asked Dick.
“你觉得怎么样？”多姆勒问迪克。

‘Of course Franz is right.’
“弗兰兹当然是对的。”

It was late afternoon when they wound up the discussion as to what Dick should do, he must be most kind and yet eliminate himself. When the doctors stood up at last, Dick’s eyes fell outside the window to where a light rain was falling—Nicole was waiting, expectant, somewhere in that rain. When, presently, he went out buttoning his oil-skin at the throat, pulling down the brim of his hat, he came upon her immediately under the roof of the main entrance.
下午晚些时候，他们结束了关于迪克应该做什么的讨论，他必须是最仁慈的，但又要自我毁灭。当医生们终于站起来时，迪克的目光落在窗外正在下着小雨的地方——妮可在雨中的某个地方满怀期待地等待着。不久，当他走出去时，他把油布扣在喉咙处，拉下帽檐，他立即在正门的屋顶下遇见了她。

‘I know a new place we can go,’ she said. ‘When I was ill I didn’t mind sitting inside with the others in the evening—what they said seemed like everything else. Naturally now I see them as ill and it’s—it’s—‘
“我知道我们可以去一个新地方，”她说。 “当我生病的时候，我不介意晚上和其他人一起坐在里面——他们说的话看起来就像其他一切一样。现在我很自然地认为他们病了，这是——这是——”

‘You’ll be leaving soon.’
“你很快就要离开了。”

‘Oh, soon. My sister, Beth, but she’s always been called Baby, she’s coming in a few weeks to take me somewhere; after that I’ll be back here for a last month.’
‘哦，很快了。我的妹妹贝丝，但她一直被称为宝贝，几周后她就会来带我去某个地方；之后我会回到这里呆最后一个月。

‘The older sister?’
“姐姐？”

‘Oh, quite a bit older. She’s twenty-four—she’s very English. She lives in London with my father’s sister. She was engaged to an Englishman but he was killed—I never saw him.’
‘哦，年纪大了一些。她二十四岁了——她非常英国化。她和我父亲的妹妹住在伦敦。她与一名英国人订婚，但他被杀了——我从未见过他。

Her face, ivory gold against the blurred sunset that strove through the rain, had a promise Dick had never seen before: the high cheekbones, the faintly wan quality, cool rather than feverish, was reminiscent of the frame of a promising colt—a creature whose life did not promise to be only a projection of youth upon a grayer screen, but instead, a true growing; the face would be handsome in middle life; it would be handsome in old age: the essential structure and the economy were there.
她的脸庞在雨中模糊的夕阳映衬下呈现出象牙般的金色，有一种迪克以前从未见过的承诺：高高的颧骨，略显苍白的气质，冷静而不是狂热，让人想起一匹有前途的小马驹的体格——一种生物他们的生活不仅仅只是青春在灰色银幕上的投射，而是真正的成长；中年容颜俊美；老年时会很漂亮：基本结构和经济都在那里。

‘What are you looking at?’
'你在看什么？'

‘I was just thinking that you’re going to be rather happy.’
“我只是想你会很高兴。”

Nicole was frightened: ‘Am I? All right—things couldn’t be worse than they have been.’
妮可害怕了：“是吗？好吧——事情再糟糕不过了。

In the covered woodshed to which she had led him, she sat crosslegged upon her golf shoes, her burberry wound about her and her cheeks stung alive by the damp air. Gravely she returned his gaze, taking in his somewhat proud carriage that never quite yielded to the wooden post against which he leaned; she looked into his face that always tried to discipline itself into molds of attentive seriousness, after excursions into joys and mockeries of its own. That part of him which seemed to fit his reddish Irish coloring she knew least; she was afraid of it, yet more anxious to explore—this was his more masculine side: the other part, the trained part, the consideration in the polite eyes, she expropriated without question, as most women did.
在她带他到有顶棚的木棚里，她盘腿坐在高尔夫球鞋上，她的巴宝莉包缠在身上，潮湿的空气刺痛了她的脸颊。她严肃地回应了他的目光，看到了他那有些骄傲的举止，他的举止从来没有完全屈服于他所靠着的木柱。她看着他的脸，在经历了自己的欢乐和嘲笑之后，他总是试图将自己训练成专注的严肃模式。她对他最不了解的部分似乎与爱尔兰的红色肤色相称。她害怕它，但更渴望探索——这是他更男性化的一面：另一部分，受过训练的部分，礼貌眼中的体贴，她毫无疑问地剥夺了，就像大多数女人一样。

‘At least this institution has been good for languages,’ said Nicole. ‘I’ve spoken French with two doctors, and German with the nurses, and Italian, or something like it, with a couple of scrubwomen and one of the patients, and I’ve picked up a lot of Spanish from another.’
“至少这个机构对语言有好处，”妮可说。 “我和两位医生讲过法语，和护士讲过德语，和几个女清洁工和一名病人讲过意大利语或类似的语言，我还从另一个人那里学会了很多西班牙语。”

‘That’s fine.’
'没关系。'

He tried to arrange an attitude but no logic seemed forthcoming.
他试图调整自己的态度，但似乎没有逻辑。

‘—Music too. Hope you didn’t think I was only interested in ragtime. I practise every day—the last few months I’ve been taking a course in Zurich on the history of music. In fact it was all that kept me going at times—music and the drawing.’ She leaned suddenly and twisted a loose strip from the sole of her shoe and then looked up. ‘I’d like to draw you just the way you are now.’
”——还有音乐。希望你不要以为我只对拉格泰姆感兴趣。我每天都练习——过去几个月我一直在苏黎世学习音乐史课程。事实上，有时这就是让我继续前进的动力——音乐和绘画。”她突然倾身，从鞋底上扭下一条松散的带子，然后抬起头来。 “我想把你画成现在的样子。”

It made him sad when she brought out her accomplishments for his approval.
当她拿出自己的成就来博得他的认可时，他感到很伤心。

‘I envy you. At present I don’t seem to be interested in anything except my work.’
'我羡慕你。目前我似乎对除了工作之外的任何事情都不感兴趣。”

‘Oh, I think that’s fine for a man,’ she said quickly. ‘But for a girl I think she ought to have lots of minor accomplishments and pass them on to her children.’
“哦，我认为这对男人来说很好，”她很快说道。 “但对于一个女孩来说，我认为她应该有很多小成就，并将它们传给她的孩子。”

‘I suppose so,’ said Dick with deliberated indifference.
“我想是的，”迪克故意表现出漠不关心的态度。

Nicole sat quiet. Dick wished she would speak so that he could play the easy rôle of wet blanket, but now she sat quiet.
妮可安静地坐着。迪克希望她能说话，这样他就可以轻松地扮演湿毯子的角色，但现在她安静地坐着。

‘You’re all well,’ he said. ‘Try to forget the past; don’t overdo things for a year or so. Go back to America and be a débutante and fall in love—and be happy.’
“你们都很好，”他说。 ‘努力忘记过去；一年左右不要做太多事情。回到美国，成为一名初出茅庐的女子，坠入爱河，然后幸福快乐。”

‘I couldn’t fall in love.’ Her injured shoe scraped a cocoon of dust from the log on which she sat.
“我无法坠入爱河。”她受伤的鞋子从她坐的原木上刮下了一层灰尘。

‘Sure you can,’ Dick insisted. ‘Not for a year maybe, but sooner or later.’ Then he added brutally: ‘You can have a perfectly normal life with a houseful of beautiful descendants. The very fact that you could make a complete comeback at your age proves that the precipitating factors were pretty near everything. Young woman, you’ll be pulling your weight long after your friends are carried off screaming.’
“当然可以，”迪克坚持道。 “也许不是一年，但迟早会发生。”然后他残酷地补充道：“你可以过着完全正常的生活，拥有一屋子美丽的后代。”在你这个年纪，你能完全东山再起，这一事实就证明了诱发因素几乎无处不在。年轻的女人，在你的朋友们尖叫着被带走之后，你还要继续努力。”

—But there was a look of pain in her eyes as she took the rough dose, the harsh reminder.
——但当她服用粗剂量、严厉的提醒时，她的眼睛里闪现出痛苦的表情。

‘I know I wouldn’t be fit to marry any one for a long time,’ she said humbly.
“我知道在很长一段时间内我都不适合嫁给任何人，”她谦虚地说。

Dick was too upset to say any more. He looked out into the grain field trying to recover his hard brassy attitude.
迪克心烦意乱，说不出话来。他望向麦田，试图恢复他那冷酷无情的态度。

‘You’ll be all right—everybody here believes in you. Why, Doctor Gregory is so proud of you that he’ll probably—‘
“你会没事的——这里的每个人都相信你。为什么，格雷戈里医生为你感到骄傲，他可能会——”

‘I hate Doctor Gregory.’
“我讨厌格雷戈里医生。”

‘Well, you shouldn’t.’
“嗯，你不应该。”

Nicole’s world had fallen to pieces, but it was only a flimsy and scarcely created world; beneath it her emotions and instincts fought on. Was it an hour ago she had waited by the entrance, wearing her hope like a corsage at her belt?
妮可的世界已经支离破碎，但这只是一个脆弱的、几乎没有被创造的世界；在它的下面，她的情感和本能仍在斗争。是一个小时前，她在入口处等候，把她的希望像胸花一样挂在腰带上吗？

... Dress stay crisp for him, button stay put, bloom narcissus— air stay still and sweet.
……衣服对他来说保持挺括，纽扣保持原样，水仙花绽放——空气保持静止和甜蜜。

‘It will be nice to have fun again,’ she fumbled on. For a moment she entertained a desperate idea of telling him how rich she was, what big houses she lived in, that really she was a valuable property—for a moment she made herself into her grandfather, Sid Warren, the horse-trader. But she survived the temptation to confuse all values and shut these matters into their Victorian side-chambers—even though there was no home left to her, save emptiness and pain.
“能再次享受乐趣真是太好了，”她结结巴巴地说。有一瞬间，她萌生了一个绝望的想法，要告诉他她有多富有，她住在多大的房子里，她确实是一个有价值的财产——有那么一刻，她把自己变成了她的祖父，马商锡德·沃伦。但她经受住了混淆所有价值观的诱惑，并将这些事情关进了维多利亚时代的侧室——尽管除了空虚和痛苦之外，她已经没有家了。

‘I have to go back to the clinic. It’s not raining now.’
‘我必须回到诊所。现在没下雨。”

Dick walked beside her, feeling her unhappiness, and wanting to drink the rain that touched her cheek.
迪克走在她身边，感受着她的不快，想要喝掉她脸颊上的雨水。

‘I have some new records,’ she said. ‘I can hardly wait to play them. Do you know—‘
“我有一些新记录，”她说。 “我迫不及待地想和他们比赛。你知道吗-'

After supper that evening, Dick thought, he would finish the break; also he wanted to kick Franz’s bottom for having partially introduced him to such a sordid business. He waited in the hall. His eyes followed a beret, not wet with waiting like Nicole’s beret, but covering a skull recently operated on. Beneath it human eyes peered, found him and came over:
那天晚上吃过晚饭后，迪克想，他就该结束休息了；他还想痛斥弗朗茨，因为他部分地将他介绍给了如此肮脏的行业。他在大厅里等着。他的目光追随着一顶贝雷帽，不像妮可的贝雷帽那样因为等待而湿润，而是遮住了最近动过手术的头骨。在它下面，人们的眼睛凝视着，找到了他，然后走了过来：

‘Bonjour, Docteur.’
“你好，医生。”

‘Bonjour, Monsieur.’
“您好，先生。”

‘Il fait beau temps.’
“Il fait beau temps”。

‘Oui, merveilleux.’
“哎呀，merveilleux。”

‘Vous êtes ici maintenant?’
“你是维护人吗？”

‘Non, pour la journée seulement.’
“不，请安息吧。”

‘Ah, bon. Alors—au revoir, Monsieur.’
‘啊，好极了。阿洛斯——再见，先生。

Glad at having survived another contact, the wretch in the beret moved away. Dick waited. Presently a nurse came downstairs and delivered him a message.
戴贝雷帽的那个可怜虫庆幸自己又躲过了一次接触，然后走开了。迪克等待着。不久，一名护士下楼给他传达了一条信息。

‘Miss Warren asks to be excused, Doctor. She wants to lie down. She wants to have dinner upstairs to-night.’
“沃伦小姐请原谅，医生。她想躺下。她今晚想在楼上吃晚饭。

The nurse hung on his response, half expecting him to imply that Miss Warren’s attitude was pathological.
护士等待着他的回答，半以为他会暗示沃伦小姐的态度是病态的。

‘Oh, I see. Well—‘ He rearranged the flow of his own saliva, the pulse of his heart. ‘I hope she feels better. Thanks.’
'我懂了。嗯——”他重新调整了自己的唾液流动和心脏的脉搏。 “我希望她感觉好一些。谢谢。'

He was puzzled and discontent. At any rate it freed him.
他感到困惑和不满。无论如何，这让他自由了。

Leaving a note for Franz begging off from supper, he walked through the countryside to the tram station. As he reached the platform, with spring twilight gilding the rails and the glass in the slot machines, he began to feel that the station, the hospital, was hovering between being centripetal and centrifugal. He felt frightened. He was glad when the substantial cobble-stones of Zurich clicked once more under his shoes.
他给弗兰兹留下了一张纸条，要求他吃完晚饭，然后穿过乡村来到电车站。当他到达站台时，春天的暮色给铁轨和老虎机的玻璃镀上一层金色，他开始感觉到车站、医院正在向心和离心之间徘徊。他感到害怕。当苏黎世坚实的鹅卵石再次在他的鞋下发出喀哒声时，他感到很高兴。

He expected to hear from Nicole next day but there was no word. Wondering if she was ill, he called the clinic and talked to Franz.
他预计第二天会收到妮可的消息，但没有任何消息。他想知道她是否生病了，于是给诊所打电话并与弗兰兹交谈。

‘She came downstairs to luncheon yesterday and to-day,’ said Franz. ‘She seemed a little abstracted and in the clouds. How did it go off?’
“她昨天和今天都下楼去吃午饭，”弗朗茨说。 “她看起来有点心不在焉，心不在焉。事情进展如何？

Dick tried to plunge over the Alpine crevasse between the sexes.
迪克试图跳进两性之间的阿尔卑斯山裂缝。

‘We didn’t get to it—at least I didn’t think we did. I tried to be distant, but I didn’t think enough happened to change her attitude if it ever went deep.’
“我们没有做到这一点——至少我不认为我们做到了。我试图保持距离，但我认为如果事情变得更严重的话，还不足以改变她的态度。

Perhaps his vanity had been hurt that there was no coup de grâce to administer.
也许他的虚荣心因为没有致命一击而受到伤害。

‘From some things she said to her nurse I’m inclined to think she understood.’
“从她对护士说的一些话来看，我倾向于认为她理解了。”

‘All right.’
'好的。'

‘It was the best thing that could have happened. She doesn’t seem over-agitated—only a little in the clouds.’
“这是可能发生的最好的事情。她看起来并没有过度激动——只是有点心不在焉。

‘All right, then.’
'那好吧。'

‘Dick, come soon and see me.’
“迪克，快来见我。”

VIII
八

During the next weeks Dick experienced a vast dissatisfaction. The pathological origin and mechanistic defeat of the affair left a flat and metallic taste. Nicole’s emotions had been used unfairly— what if they turned out to have been his own? Necessarily he must absent himself from felicity a while—in dreams he saw her walking on the clinic path swinging her wide straw hat... .
在接下来的几周里，迪克经历了极大的不满。这件事的病态起源和机械性失败留下了平淡而金属的味道。妮可的情感被不公平地利用了——如果这些情感原来是他自己的怎么办？他必然要暂时远离幸福——在梦中，他看到她在诊所的小路上走着，摇摆着宽大的草帽……

One time he saw her in person; as he walked past the Palace Hotel, a magnificent Rolls curved into the half-moon entrance. Small within its gigantic proportions, and buoyed up by the power of a hundred superfluous horses, sat Nicole and a young woman whom he assumed was her sister. Nicole saw him and momentarily her lips parted in an expression of fright. Dick shifted his hat and passed, yet for a moment the air around him was loud with the circlings of all the goblins on the Gross-Münster. He tried to write the matter out of his mind in a memorandum that went into detail as to the solemn régime before her; the possibilities of another ‘push’ of the malady under the stresses which the world would inevitably supply—in all a memorandum that would have been convincing to any one save to him who had written it.
有一次他亲眼见到了她；当他走过皇宫饭店时，一辆华丽的劳斯莱斯弯进了半月形的入口。尼科尔和一个年轻女子坐着，他以为是她的妹妹，在它巨大的比例中显得很小，并由一百匹多余的马的力量支撑着。妮可看到了他，嘴唇瞬间张开，露出惊恐的表情。迪克转动帽子走了过去，但有那么一会儿，他周围的空气因大明斯特上所有妖精的盘旋而喧闹起来。他试图把这件事从他的脑海中写下来，写在一份备忘录中，详细介绍了她面前的庄严制度。在世界不可避免地提供的压力下，这种疾病有可能再次被“推动”——总之，这份备忘录对任何人来说都是令人信服的，除了他自己。

The total value of this effort was to make him realize once more how far his emotions were involved; thenceforth he resolutely provided antidotes. One was the telephone girl from Bar-sur-Aube, now touring Europe from Nice to Coblenz, in a desperate roundup of the men she had known in her never-to-be-equalled holiday; another was the making of arrangements to get home on a government transport in August; a third was a consequent intensification of work on his proofs for the book that this autumn was to be presented to the German-speaking world of psychiatry.
这种努力的总价值在于让他再次意识到自己的情绪有多深。此后他毅然提供解药。其中一个是来自奥布河畔巴尔的电话女孩，她现在正在从尼斯到科布伦茨的欧洲巡回演出，绝望地围捕了她在无与伦比的假期中认识的男人。另一个是安排八月份乘坐政府交通工具回家；第三个是随后加强了他为今年秋天将向德语精神病学界推出的书的校对工作。

Dick had outgrown the book; he wanted now to do more spade work; if he got an exchange fellowship he could count on plenty of routine.
迪克已经长大了，已经无法阅读这本书了。他现在想做更多的铲子工作；如果他获得了交换奖学金，他可以指望有很多日常活动。

Meanwhile he had projected a new work: An Attempt at a Uniform and Pragmatic Classification of the Neuroses and Psychoses, Based on an Examination of Fifteen Hundred Pre-Krapælin and Post-Krapælin Cases as they would be Diagnosed in the Terminology of the Different Contemporary Schools—and another sonorous paragraph—Together with a Chronology of Such Subdivisions of Opinion as Have Arisen Independently.
与此同时，他计划了一项新工作：基于对 1500 个克拉帕林前和克拉帕林后病例的检查，尝试对神经症和精神病进行统一和实用的分类，因为这些病例将用不同当代学派的术语进行诊断——以及另一个响亮的段落——以及独立出现的此类细分观点的年表。

This title would look monumental in German.*
这个标题在德语中看起来很具有纪念意义。*

*Ein Versuch die Neurosen und Psychosen gleichmässig und pragmatisch zu klassifizieren auf Grund der Untersuchung von fünfzehn hundert pre-Krapaelin und post-Krapaelin Fällen wie siz diagnostiziert sein würden in der Terminologie von den verschiedenen Schulen der Gegenwart—and another sonorous paragraph—Zusammen mit einer Chronologic solcher Subdivisionen der Meinung welche unabhängig entstanden sind.
*Ein Versuch die Neurosen 和 Psychosen gleichmässig und pragmatisch zu klassifizieren auf Grund der Untersuchung von fünfzehn hundert pre-Krapaelin 和 post-Krapaelin Fällen wie siz diagnostiziert sein würden in der Terminologie von den verschiedenen Schulen der Gegenwart — 以及另一个响亮的段落——祖萨门·米特·艾纳按时间顺序细分是我认为最重要的部分。

Going into Montreux Dick pedalled slowly, gaping at the Jugenhorn whenever possible, and blinded by glimpses of the lake through the alleys of the shore hotels. He was conscious of the groups of English, emergent after four years and walking with detective-story suspicion in their eyes, as though they were about to be assaulted in this questionable country by German trained-bands. There were building and awakening everywhere on this mound of débris formed by a mountain torrent. At Berne and at Lausanne on the way south, Dick had been eagerly asked if there would be Americans this year. ‘By August, if not in June?’
进入蒙特勒，迪克缓慢地踩着踏板，一有机会就目瞪口呆地看着尤根霍恩，透过岸边旅馆的小巷，瞥见的湖水让他眼花缭乱。他意识到四年后出现的英国人群体，他们的眼神中带着侦探故事般的怀疑，仿佛他们即将在这个可疑的国家受到德国训练有素的乐队的袭击。在这座由山洪形成的废墟堆上，到处都在建设和苏醒。在伯尔尼和南下的洛桑，迪克被热切地询问今年是否会有美国人参加。 “如果不是六月的话，到八月会怎样？”

He wore leather shorts, an army shirt, mountain shoes. In his knapsack were a cotton suit and a change of underwear. At the Glion funicular he checked his bicycle and took a small beer on the terrace of the station buffet, meanwhile watching the little bug crawl down the eighty-degree slope of the hill. His ear was full of dried blood from La Tour de Pelz, where he had sprinted under the impression that he was a spoiled athlete. He asked for alcohol and cleared up the exterior while the funicular slid down port. He saw his bicycle embarked, slung his knapsack into the lower compartment of the car, and followed it in.
他穿着皮短裤、军装衬衫和登山鞋。他的背包里有一套棉质西装和一套换洗内衣。在格里昂缆车站，他检查了自行车，在车站自助餐的露台上喝了一小杯啤酒，同时看着小虫子沿着八十度的山坡爬下。他的耳朵里充满了在拉图德佩尔茨赛道上干涸的血迹，他在那里冲刺时以为自己是一个被宠坏的运动员。当缆车滑下港口时，他要了酒并清理了外部。他看到自己的自行车上了车，就把背包扔进了车的下层车厢，也跟着进去了。

Mountain-climbing cars are built on a slant similar to the angle of a hat-brim of a man who doesn’t want to be recognized. As water gushed from the chamber under the car, Dick was impressed with the ingenuity of the whole idea—a complimentary car was now taking on mountain water at the top and would pull the lightened car up by gravity, as soon as the brakes were released. It must have been a great inspiration. In the seat across, a couple of British were discussing the cable itself.
登山车的倾斜角度类似于一个不想被认出的人的帽檐角度。当水从汽车下方的房间涌出时，迪克对整个想法的巧妙性印象深刻——一辆免费的汽车现在正在顶部吸收山水，一旦松开刹车，就会通过重力将减轻的汽车拉上来。 。这一定是一个很大的启发。对面的座位上，几个英国人正在讨论电缆本身。

‘The ones made in England always last five or six years. Two years ago the Germans underbid us, and how long do you think their cable lasted?’
“英国制造的东西总是能用五六年。”两年前，德国人出价低于我们，你认为他们的电缆能持续多久？

‘How long?’
'多久？'

‘A year and ten months. Then the Swiss sold it to the Italians. They don’t have rigid inspections of cables.’
‘一年零十个月。然后瑞士人把它卖给了意大利人。他们没有对电缆进行严格的检查。

‘I can see it would be a terrible thing for Switzerland if a cable broke.’
“我知道，如果电缆断裂，对瑞士来说将是一件可怕的事情。”

The conductor shut a door; he telephoned his confrere among the undulati, and with a jerk the car was pulled upward, heading for a pinpoint on an emerald hill above. After it cleared the low roofs, the skies of Vaud, Valais, Swiss Savoy, and Geneva spread around the passengers in cyclorama. On the centre of the lake, cooled by the piercing current of the Rhône, lay the true centre of the Western World. Upon it floated swans like boats and boats like swans, both lost in the nothingness of the heartless beauty. It was a bright day, with sun glittering on the grass beach below and the white courts of the Kursal. The figures on the courts threw no shadows.
售票员关上了门；他给波浪中的同伴打电话，猛地一拉，汽车就被拉了起来，驶向上方一座翠绿山丘上的一个精确地点。当它飞过低矮的屋顶后，沃州、瓦莱州、瑞士萨沃伊和日内瓦的天空以天幕的形式铺展在乘客周围。被罗讷河急流冷却的湖中心，是西方世界真正的中心。其上漂浮着如船的天鹅和如天鹅的船，都迷失在无情的美丽的虚无中。这是一个阳光明媚的日子，阳光照耀在下面的草地海滩和库萨尔的白色庭院上。法庭上的人物没有投下任何阴影。

When Chillon and the island palace of Salagnon came into view Dick turned his eyes inward. The funicular was above the highest houses of the shore; on both sides a tangle of foliage and flowers culminated at intervals in masses of color. It was a rail-side garden, and in the car was a sign: Défense de cueillir les fleurs.
当西庸和萨拉尼翁岛的宫殿映入眼帘时，迪克将目光转向内。缆车位于海岸最高的房屋上方。两边都是乱七八糟的树叶和花朵，每隔一段时间就会呈现出大量的色彩。那是一个铁路旁的花园，车厢里挂着一个牌子：Défense decuillir les fleurs。

Though one must not pick flowers on the way up, the blossoms trailed in as they passed—Dorothy Perkins roses dragged patiently through each compartment slowly waggling with the motion of the funicular, letting go at the last to swing back to their rosy cluster. Again and again these branches went through the car.
虽然在上山的路上不能摘花，但花朵在经过时也随之而来——多萝西·帕金斯玫瑰耐心地拖过每个隔间，随着缆车的移动而缓慢摇摆，最后放开，重新回到玫瑰色的花丛中。这些树枝一次又一次地穿过汽车。

In the compartment above and in front of Dick’s, a group of English were standing up and exclaiming upon the backdrop of sky, when suddenly there was a confusion among them—they parted to give passage to a couple of young people who made apologies and scrambled over into the rear compartment of the funicular—Dick’s compartment. The young man was a Latin with the eyes of a stuffed deer; the girl was Nicole.
迪克前面的车厢里，一群英国人正站着，对着天空惊呼，突然间一阵混乱——他们分开，给几个年轻人让路，年轻人道歉并争先恐后地走了过来。进入缆车的后车厢——迪克的车厢。这个年轻人是一个拉丁人，有着一只毛绒鹿的眼睛。这个女孩就是妮可。

The two climbers gasped momentarily from their efforts; as they settled into seats, laughing and crowding the English to the corners, Nicole said, ‘Hel-LO.’ She was lovely to look at; immediately Dick saw that something was different; in a second he realized it was her fine-spun hair, bobbed like Irene Castle’s and fluffed into curls. She wore a sweater of powder blue and a white tennis skirt—she was the first morning in May and every taint of the clinic was departed.
两名登山者因他们的努力而暂时喘不过气来。当他们坐下来，笑着把英国人挤到角落里时，妮可说：“你好，洛。”她看起来很可爱；她很漂亮。迪克立即发现有些东西不同了。刹那间，他意识到那是她细密的头发，像艾琳·卡斯特一样剪成短发，蓬松成卷发。她穿着一件粉蓝色的毛衣和一条白色的网球裙——这是五月的第一个早晨，诊所的所有污点都消失了。

‘Plunk!’ she gasped. ‘Whoo-oo that guard. They’ll arrest us at the next stop. Doctor Diver, the Conte de Marmora.’
“砰！”她喘着气说。 ‘哇哦，那个守卫。他们会在下一站逮捕我们。戴弗博士，马尔莫拉伯爵。

‘Gee-imminy!’ She felt her new hair, panting. ‘Sister bought first-class tickets—it’s a matter of principle with her.’ She and Marmora exchanged glances and shouted: ‘Then we found that firstclass is the hearse part behind the chauffeur—shut in with curtains for a rainy day, so you can’t see anything. But Sister’s very dignified—‘ Again Nicole and Marmora laughed with young intimacy.
“哎呀——哎呀！”她感觉到自己的新头发，气喘吁吁。 “姐姐买了头等舱的票——这对她来说是原则问题。”她和玛莫拉对视一眼，喊道：“然后我们发现头等舱是司机后面的灵车部分——下雨天用窗帘把门关起来，所以你什么也看不见。但姐姐非常有尊严——”妮可和玛莫拉再次带着年轻的亲密笑声。

‘Where you bound?’ asked Dick.
“你开往哪里？”迪克问。

‘Caux. You too?’ Nicole looked at his costume. ‘That your bicycle they got up in front?’
‘科克斯。你也是吗？”妮可看着他的服装。 “他们把你的自行车放在前面？”

‘Yes. I’m going to coast down Monday.’
'是的。周一我要顺流而下。

‘With me on your handle-bars? I mean, really—will you? I can’t think of more fun.’
‘把我放在你的车把上？我的意思是，真的——你愿意吗？我想不出还有什么比这更有趣的了。

‘But I will carry you down in my arms,’ Marmora protested intensely. ‘I will roller-skate you—or I will throw you and you will fall slowly like a feather.’
“但我会把你抱在怀里，”玛莫拉强烈抗议。 “我会给你滑旱冰——或者我会把你扔下去，你会像羽毛一样慢慢地掉下来。”

The delight in Nicole’s face—to be a feather again instead of a plummet, to float and not to drag. She was a carnival to watch—at times primly coy, posing, grimacing and gesturing—sometimes the shadow fell and the dignity of old suffering flowed down into her finger tips. Dick wished himself away from her, fearing that he was a reminder of a world well left behind. He resolved to go to the other hotel.
妮可脸上洋溢着喜悦——再次成为羽毛而不是坠落，漂浮而不是拖曳。她是一场值得观赏的狂欢——时而拘谨、摆姿势、做鬼脸、做手势——时而阴影落下，旧日苦难的尊严流淌到她的指尖。迪克希望自己远离她，担心他会让人想起一个早已被抛在身后的世界。他决定去另一家旅馆。

When the funicular came to rest those new to it stirred in suspension between the blues of two heavens. It was merely for a mysterious exchange between the conductor of the car going up and the conductor of the car coming down. Then up and up over a forest path and a gorge—then again up a hill that became solid with narcissus, from passengers to sky. The people in Montreux playing tennis in the lakeside courts were pinpoints now. Something new was in the air; freshness—freshness embodying itself in music as the car slid into Glion and they heard the orchestra in the hotel garden.
当缆车停下来时，那些刚接触缆车的人在两片天空的蓝色之间悬浮着。只不过是上车的售票员和下车的售票员进行了一次神秘的对话。然后越过一条森林小路和一个峡谷，然后又爬上一座山，从乘客到天空，山上都长满了水仙花。蒙特勒湖畔球场上打网球的人们现在已经成为了焦点。空气中弥漫着新的气息。新鲜感——当汽车滑入格里昂时，新鲜感就体现在音乐中，他们听到酒店花园里的管弦乐队演奏。

When they changed to the mountain train the music was drowned by the rushing water released from the hydraulic chamber. Almost overhead was Caux, where the thousand windows of a hotel burned in the late sun.
当他们换乘山地列车时，音乐被液压室释放的湍急水淹没了。头顶上几乎就是考克斯，那里有一家旅馆的上千扇窗户在夕阳下燃烧。

But the approach was different—a leather-lunged engine pushed the passengers round and round in a corkscrew, mounting, rising; they chugged through low-level clouds and for a moment Dick lost Nicole’s face in the spray of the slanting donkey engine; they skirted a lost streak of wind with the hotel growing in size at each spiral, until with a vast surprise they were there, on top of the sunshine.
但方法不同——皮革发动机推动乘客像螺旋一样旋转、上升、上升；他们嘎吱嘎吱地穿过低层云层，有一会儿，迪克在倾斜的驴式发动机的喷射中失去了妮可的脸。他们绕过一条消失的风，酒店的规模在每一个螺旋上都在变大，直到他们惊讶地发现，他们就在那里，在阳光的顶上。

In the confusion of arrival, as Dick slung his knapsack and started forward on the platform to get his bicycle, Nicole was beside him.
在到达的混乱中，当迪克背上背包，开始在站台上取自行车时，妮可就在他身边。

‘Aren’t you at our hotel?’ she asked.
“你不在我们酒店吗？”她问道。

‘I’m economizing.’
“我在节约。”

‘Will you come down and have dinner?’ Some confusion with baggage ensued. ‘This is my sister—Doctor Diver from Zurich.’
“你能下来吃晚饭吗？”随之而来的是行李方面的一些混乱。 “这是我的妹妹——来自苏黎世的戴弗医生。”

Dick bowed to a young woman of twenty-five, tall and confident. She was both formidable and vulnerable, he decided, remembering other women with flower-like mouths grooved for bits.
迪克向一位二十五岁、身材高大、自信的年轻女子鞠了一躬。她既强大又脆弱，他想起了其他女人，她的嘴像花朵一样，上面布满了凹槽。

‘I’ll drop in after dinner,’ Dick promised. ‘First I must get acclimated.’
“晚饭后我会过来，”迪克答应道。 “首先我必须适应。”

He wheeled off his bicycle, feeling Nicole’s eyes following him, feeling her helpless first love, feeling it twist around inside him. He went three hundred yards up the slope to the other hotel, he engaged a room and found himself washing without a memory of the intervening ten minutes, only a sort of drunken flush pierced with voices, unimportant voices that did not know how much he was loved.
他下了自行车，感觉到妮可的目光追随着他，感觉到她无助的初恋，感觉到它在他体内扭曲。他沿着斜坡走了三百码，来到了另一家旅馆，订了一个房间，发现自己正在洗漱，不记得中间的十分钟，只有一种醉酒的红晕，被各种声音刺穿，那些不重要的声音不知道他有多重要。爱过。

IX

They were waiting for him and incomplete without him. He was still the incalculable element; Miss Warren and the young Italian wore their anticipation as obviously as Nicole. The salon of the hotel, a room of fabled acoustics, was stripped for dancing but there was a small gallery of Englishwomen of a certain age, with neckbands, dyed hair and faces powdered pinkish gray; and of American women of a certain age, with snowy-white transformations, black dresses and lips of cherry red. Miss Warren and Marmora were at a corner table—Nicole was diagonally across from them forty yards away, and as Dick arrived he heard her voice:
他们正在等待他，没有他，他们就变得不完整。他仍然是不可估量的因素；沃伦小姐和年轻的意大利人与妮可一样明显地表现出他们的期待。酒店的沙龙是一间具有传奇般音响效果的房间，为了跳舞而被脱光衣服，但里面有一个小画廊，里面都是一定年龄的英国女性，她们戴着颈带，染着头发，脸上涂着粉灰色的粉。还有一定年龄的美国女性，雪白的变身，黑色的裙子和樱桃红的嘴唇。沃伦小姐和玛莫拉坐在角落的桌子旁——妮可就在他们斜对面四十码远的地方，当迪克到达时，他听到了她的声音：

‘Can you hear me? I’m speaking naturally.’
'你能听到我吗？我很自然地说。

‘Perfectly,’
'完美，'

‘Hello, Doctor Diver.’
“你好，戴弗医生。”

‘What’s this?’
'这是什么？'

‘You realize the people in the centre of the floor can’t hear what I say, but you can?’
“你意识到地板中央的人听不到我说的话，但你可以吗？”

‘A waiter told us about it,’ said Miss Warren. ‘Corner to corner— it’s like wireless.’
“一位服务员告诉我们这件事，”沃伦小姐说。 “从角落到角落——就像无线一样。”

It was exciting up on the mountain, like a ship at sea. Presently Marmora’s parents joined them. They treated the Warrens with respect—Dick gathered that their fortunes had something to do with a bank in Milan that had something to do with the Warren fortunes. But Baby Warren wanted to talk to Dick, wanted to talk to him with the impetus that sent her out vagrantly toward all new men, as though she were on an inelastic tether and considered that she might as well get to the end of it as soon as possible. She crossed and recrossed her knees frequently in the manner of tall restless virgins.
山上的感觉就像海上的船一样刺激。不久，玛莫拉的父母也加入了他们。他们尊重沃伦一家——迪克推测他们的财富与米兰的一家银行有关，而这家银行也与沃伦一家的财富有关。但宝贝沃伦想和迪克说话，想和他说话，她的冲动让她流浪到所有新男人身边，仿佛她被一根没有弹性的绳索拴着，认为她最好尽快结束这一切。尽可能。她频繁地交叉双膝，就像高个子、不安分的处女一样。

‘—Nicole told me that you took part care of her, and had a lot to do with her getting well. What I can’t understand is what WE’RE supposed to do—they were so indefinite at the sanitarium; they only told me she ought to be natural and gay. I knew the Marmoras were up here so I asked Tino to meet us at the funicular. And you see what happens—the very first thing Nicole has him crawling over the sides of the car as if they were both insane—‘
“——妮可告诉我，你参与了照顾她，对她的康复有很大帮助。我不明白的是我们应该做什么——他们在疗养院里是如此不确定；他们只是告诉我她应该自然而快乐。我知道马尔莫拉群岛就在这里，所以我请蒂诺在缆车处与我们会面。你会看到发生了什么——妮可让他从汽车两侧爬过去，就好像他们都疯了一样——”

‘That was absolutely normal,’ Dick laughed. ‘I’d call it a good sign. They were showing off for each other.’
“这绝对是正常的，”迪克笑道。 “我认为这是一个好兆头。他们互相炫耀。

‘But how can I tell? Before I knew it, almost in front of my eyes, she had her hair cut off, in Zurich, because of a picture in ‘Vanity Fair.’’
‘但是我怎么知道呢？在我意识到之前，几乎就在我眼前，她在苏黎世因为《名利场》中的一张照片而剪掉了头发。

‘That’s all right. She’s a schizoid—a permanent eccentric. You can’t change that.’
'没关系。她是一个精神分裂症患者——一个永远的怪人。你无法改变这一点。

‘What is it?’
'它是什么？'

‘Just what I said—an eccentric.’
“正如我所说——一个怪人。”

‘Well, how can any one tell what’s eccentric and what’s crazy?’
“那么，谁能分辨什么是古怪的，什么是疯狂的呢？”

‘Nothing is going to be crazy—Nicole is all fresh and happy, you needn’t be afraid.’
“没有什么会变得疯狂——妮可充满活力和快乐，你不必害怕。”

Baby shifted her knees about—she was a compendium of all the discontented women who had loved Byron a hundred years before, yet, in spite of the tragic affair with the guards’ officer there was something wooden and onanistic about her.
贝比动了动膝盖——她是一百年前爱过拜伦的所有心怀不满的女人的缩影，然而，尽管她与警卫军官发生了悲惨的事件，但她还是有些木讷和手淫。

‘I don’t mind the responsibility,’ she declared, ‘but I’m in the air. We’ve never had anything like this in the family before—we know Nicole had some shock and my opinion is it was about a boy, but we don’t really know. Father says he would have shot him if he could have found out.’
“我不介意责任，”她宣称，“但我在空中。”我们家里以前从未发生过这样的事情——我们知道妮可感到有些震惊，我认为这是关于一个男孩的，但我们真的不知道。父亲说，如果他发现的话，他会开枪射杀他的。

The orchestra was playing ‘Poor Butterfly”; young Marmora was dancing with his mother. It was a tune new enough to them all. Listening, and watching Nicole’s shoulders as she chattered to the elder Marmora, whose hair was dashed with white like a piano keyboard, Dick thought of the shoulders of a violin, and then he thought of the dishonor, the secret. Oh, butterfly—the moments pass into hours—
管弦乐队正在演奏《可怜的蝴蝶》；年轻的马尔莫拉正在和他的母亲一起跳舞。这对他们所有人来说都是一首足够新的曲子。迪克听着，看着妮可的肩膀，她对年长的玛莫拉喋喋不休，她的头发像钢琴键盘一样白了，迪克想到了小提琴的肩膀，然后他想到了耻辱，秘密。哦，蝴蝶——瞬间转瞬即逝——

‘Actually I have a plan,’ Baby continued with apologetic hardness. ‘It may seem absolutely impractical to you but they say Nicole will need to be looked after for a few years. I don’t know whether you know Chicago or not—‘
“其实我有一个计划。”贝比带着歉意继续说道。 “这对你来说似乎绝对不切实际，但他们说妮可需要照顾几年。我不知道你是否了解芝加哥——”

‘I don’t.’
'我不。'

‘Well, there’s a North Side and a South Side and they’re very much separated. The North Side is chic and all that, and we’ve always lived over there, at least for many years, but lots of old families, old Chicago families, if you know what I mean, still live on the South Side. The University is there. I mean it’s stuffy to some people, but anyhow it’s different from the North Side. I don’t know whether you understand.’
“嗯，有一个北区和一个南区，而且它们分开得很远。北区很别致，我们一直住在那里，至少很多年了，但是很多老家庭，老芝加哥家庭，如果你明白我的意思，仍然住在南区。大学就在那里。我的意思是，对某些人来说，这里很闷，但无论如何，它与北区不同。不知道你是否明白。

He nodded. With some concentration he had been able to follow her.
他点了点头。他全神贯注地跟着她。

‘Now of course we have lots of connections there—Father controls certain chairs and fellowships and so forth at the University, and I thought if we took Nicole home and threw her with that crowd—you see she’s quite musical and speaks all these languages—what could be better in her condition than if she fell in love with some good doctor—‘
“当然，现在我们在那里有很多联系——父亲控制着大学的某些椅子和奖学金等等，我想如果我们把妮可带回家，把她和那群人扔在一起——你会发现她很有音乐天赋，会说所有这些语言——在她的情况下，还有什么比她爱上一位好医生更好的——”

A burst of hilarity surged up in Dick, the Warrens were going to buy Nicole a doctor—You got a nice doctor you can let us use? There was no use worrying about Nicole when they were in the position of being able to buy her a nice young doctor, the paint scarcely dry on him.
迪克心中一阵大笑，沃伦一家要给妮可买一名医生——你有一个好医生可以让我们用吗？当他们能够给她买一位年轻的好医生时，担心尼科尔是没有用的，他身上的油漆还没有干。

‘But how about the doctor?’ he said automatically.
“但是医生呢？”他不假思索地说。

‘There must be many who’d jump at the chance.’
“一定有很多人会抓住这个机会。”

The dancers were back, but Baby whispered quickly:
舞者们回来了，但贝比很快低声说道：

‘This is the sort of thing I mean. Now where is Nicole—she’s gone off somewhere. Is she upstairs in her room? What am I supposed to do? I never know whether it’s something innocent or whether I ought to go find her.’
‘这就是我的意思。现在妮可在哪里——她去了某个地方。她在楼上她的房间里吗？我应该做些什么？我从来不知道这是否是无辜的，或者我是否应该去找她。

‘Perhaps she just wants to be by herself—people living alone get used to loneliness.’ Seeing that Miss Warren was not listening he stopped. ‘I’ll take a look around.’
“也许她只是想一个人呆着——独居的人会习惯孤独。”看到沃伦小姐没有在听，他停了下来。 “我去看看周围。”

For a moment all the outdoors shut in with mist was like spring with the curtains drawn. Life was gathered near the hotel. Dick passed some cellar windows where bus boys sat on bunks and played cards over a litre of Spanish wine. As he approached the promenade, the stars began to come through the white crests of the high Alps. On the horseshoe walk overlooking the lake Nicole was the figure motionless between two lamp stands, and he approached silently across the grass. She turned to him with an expression of: ‘Here YOU are,’ and for a moment he was sorry he had come.
一时之间，室外笼罩在薄雾中，就像拉上了窗帘的春天一样。生活聚集在酒店附近。迪克经过一些地窖的窗户，公交车男孩坐在铺位上，喝着一升西班牙葡萄酒打牌。当他走近海滨长廊时，星星开始穿过阿尔卑斯山的白色山峰。在俯瞰尼科尔湖的马蹄形小道上，两个灯台之间的身影一动不动，他穿过草地悄无声息地靠近。她转向他，表情是：“你来了。”有那么一刻，他为自己的到来感到遗憾。

‘Your sister wondered.’
“你姐姐想知道。”

‘Oh!’ She was accustomed to being watched. With an effort she explained herself: ‘Sometimes I get a little—it gets a little too much. I’ve lived so quietly. To-night that music was too much. It made me want to cry—‘
“噢！”她已经习惯了被人注视。她努力解释自己：“有时我会得到一点——有点太多了。”我就这么平静地生活着。今晚的音乐太多了。这让我想哭——”

‘I understand.’
'我明白。'

‘This has been an awfully exciting day.’
“这是非常令人兴奋的一天。”

‘I know.’
'我知道。'

‘I don’t want to do anything anti-social—I’ve caused everybody enough trouble. But to-night I wanted to get away.’
“我不想做任何反社会的事情——我已经给大家带来了足够多的麻烦。但今晚我想离开。

It occurred to Dick suddenly, as it might occur to a dying man that he had forgotten to tell where his will was, that Nicole had been ‘re-educated’ by Dohmler and the ghostly generations behind him; it occurred to him also that there would be so much she would have to be told. But having recorded this wisdom within himself, he yielded to the insistent face-value of the situation and said:
迪克突然想到，就像一个垂死的人可能会想到他忘记告诉自己的遗嘱在哪里一样，妮可已经被多姆勒和他身后幽灵般的几代人“再教育”了；他还想到，有很多事情要告诉她。但在将这种智慧记录在自己内心之后，他屈服于这种情况的表面价值，说道：

‘You’re a nice person—just keep using your own judgment about yourself.’
“你是一个好人——只要继续用你自己的判断来评价自己就可以了。”

‘You like me?’
'你喜欢我？'

‘Of course.’
'当然。'

‘Would you—‘ They were strolling along toward the dim end of the horseshoe, two hundred yards ahead. ‘If I hadn’t been sick would you—I mean, would I have been the sort of girl you might have—oh, slush, you know what I mean.’
“你愿意吗——”他们正漫步朝前方两百码处马蹄铁昏暗的一端走去。 “如果我没有生病，你会不会——我的意思是，我会成为你可能拥有的那种女孩吗——哦，雪泥，你知道我的意思。”

He was in for it now, possessed by a vast irrationality. She was so near that he felt his breathing change but again his training came to his aid in a boy’s laugh and a trite remark.
他现在陷入了困境，被一种巨大的非理性所占据。她离他如此之近，他感觉到自己的呼吸发生了变化，但他所受的训练再次在男孩的笑声和一句陈词滥调中帮了他的忙。

‘You’re teasing yourself, my dear. Once I knew a man who fell in love with his nurse—‘ The anecdote rambled on, punctuated by their footsteps. Suddenly Nicole interrupted in succinct Chicagoese: ‘Bull!’
‘你在戏弄自己，亲爱的。有一次我认识一个男人，他爱上了他的护士——”轶事漫无目的地讲着，中间夹杂着他们的脚步声。突然，妮可用简洁的芝加哥话打断了他的话：“公牛！”

‘That’s a very vulgar expression.’
“这是一个非常粗俗的表达方式。”

‘What about it?’ she flared up. ‘You don’t think I’ve got any common sense—before I was sick I didn’t have any, but I have now. And if I don’t know you’re the most attractive man I ever met you must think I’m still crazy. It’s my hard luck, all right—but don’t pretend I don’t KNOW—I know everything about you and me.’
“那又怎么样？”她火冒三丈。 “你以为我没有任何常识——在我生病之前我没有任何常识，但我现在有了。如果我不知道你是我见过的最有魅力的男人，你一定认为我还是疯了。这是我的运气不好，好吧——但不要假装我不知道——我知道关于你和我的一切。

Dick was at an additional disadvantage. He remembered the statement of the elder Miss Warren as to the young doctors that could be purchased in the intellectual stockyards of the South Side of Chicago, and he hardened for a moment. ‘You’re a fetching kid, but I couldn’t fall in love.’
迪克还处于另一个劣势。他想起了老沃伦小姐所说的关于可以在芝加哥南区的知识畜场购买年轻医生的说法，他的态度一下子变得坚定起来。 “你是个迷人的孩子，但我无法坠入爱河。”

‘You won’t give me a chance.’
“你不会给我机会的。”

‘WHAT!’
'什么！'

The impertinence, the right to invade implied, astounded him. Short of anarchy he could not think of any chance that Nicole Warren deserved.
这种无礼、隐含的侵略权利令他震惊。如果不是无政府状态，他想不出妮可·沃伦应得的任何机会。

‘Give me a chance now.’
“现在给我一个机会。”

The voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. He felt the young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm growing stronger to hold her. There were now no more plans than if Dick had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.
当她靠近时，声音低沉，沉入她的胸膛，将紧身衣拉到她的心脏上。他感觉到年轻的嘴唇，她的身体在越来越有力地拥抱她的手臂上松了口气。现在没有什么计划了，就好像迪克随意制造了某种不溶性的混合物，原子结合在一起，不可分离；你可以把它们全部扔掉，但它们再也不能回到原子尺度了。当他拥抱她，品尝她，当她用她自己的嘴唇越来越靠近他时，她自己的嘴唇对自己来说是新鲜的，淹没和吞没在爱中，但安慰和胜利，他很庆幸自己还有一个存在，如果只是她湿润的眼睛里的倒影。

‘My God,’ he gasped, ‘you’re fun to kiss.’
“天啊，”他喘着气说，“亲吻你真有趣。”

That was talk, but Nicole had a better hold on him now and she held it; she turned coquette and walked away, leaving him as suspended as in the funicular of the afternoon. She felt: There, that’ll show him, how conceited; how he could do with me; oh, wasn’t it wonderful! I’ve got him, he’s mine. Now in the sequence came flight, but it was all so sweet and new that she dawdled, wanting to draw all of it in.
那是说说而已，但妮可现在更好地控制住了他，而她也控制住了。她卖弄风情地走开了，留下他像下午的缆车上一样悬浮着。她觉得：好了，这会告诉他，他是多么自负；他能怎样对待我？哦，那不是很棒吗！我得到了他，他是我的。现在序列中出现了飞行，但这一切都是如此甜蜜和新鲜，以至于她磨磨蹭蹭，想要把这一切都画进去。

She shivered suddenly. Two thousand feet below she saw the necklace and bracelet of lights that were Montreux and Vevey, beyond them a dim pendant of Lausanne. From down there somewhere ascended a faint sound of dance music. Nicole was up in her head now, cool as cool, trying to collate the sentimentalities of her childhood, as deliberate as a man getting drunk after battle. But she was still afraid of Dick, who stood near her, leaning, characteristically, against the iron fence that rimmed the horseshoe; and this prompted her to say: ‘I can remember how I stood waiting for you in the garden—holding all my self in my arms like a basket of flowers. It was that to me anyhow—I thought I was sweet—waiting to hand that basket to you.’
她突然浑身发抖。在两千英尺以下，她看到了蒙特勒和沃韦的灯光项链和手镯，再远处是洛桑的昏暗吊坠。从下面某处传来微弱的舞曲声。妮可现在正冷静地思考着，试图整理她童年时的感伤情绪，就像一个男人在战斗后喝醉一样从容不迫。但她仍然害怕迪克，他站在她附近，典型地靠在马蹄铁边缘的铁栅栏上。这促使她说：“我记得我是如何站在花园里等你的——把我整个人抱在怀里，就像一篮子花一样。”不管怎样，对我来说就是这样——我觉得我很可爱——等着把那个篮子递给你。

He breathed over her shoulder and turned her insistently about; she kissed him several times, her face getting big every time she came close, her hands holding him by the shoulders.
他的呼吸越过她的肩膀，坚持把她转过身来。她吻了他好几次，每次靠近她的脸都变大，双手抓住他的肩膀。

‘It’s raining hard.’
“雨下得很大。”

Suddenly there was a booming from the wine slopes across the lake; cannons were shooting at hail-bearing clouds in order to break them. The lights of the promenade went off, went on again. Then the storm came swiftly, first falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents from the mountains and washing loud down the roads and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder, while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel. Mountains and lake disappeared—the hotel crouched amid tumult, chaos and darkness.
突然，湖对岸的酒坡传来一阵轰鸣声；大炮向带有冰雹的云层射击，以击碎它们。长廊的灯灭了，又亮了。暴风雨来得很快，先是从天而降，然后又从山上倾泻而下，大声地冲刷着道路和石沟。随之而来的是黑暗、可怕的天空、野蛮的闪电和撕裂世界的雷声，而破碎的、毁灭性的云层则沿着酒店飞过。山脉和湖泊消失了——酒店蜷缩在喧嚣、混乱和黑暗之中。

By this time Dick and Nicole had reached the vestibule, where Baby Warren and the three Marmoras were anxiously awaiting them. It was exciting coming out of the wet fog—with the doors banging, to stand and laugh and quiver with emotion, wind in their ears and rain on their clothes. Now in the ballroom the orchestra was playing a Strauss waltz, high and confusing.
这时候迪克和妮可已经到达前厅，沃伦宝宝和三只马尔摩拉正在那里焦急地等待着他们。从潮湿的雾气中出来真是令人兴奋——门砰砰作响，站着笑，激动地颤抖，耳边有风，衣服上有雨。现在，在舞厅里，管弦乐队正在演奏施特劳斯华尔兹，高亢而令人困惑。

... For Doctor Diver to marry a mental patient? How did it happen? Where did it begin?
……让戴弗医生嫁给一个精神病人？它是怎么发生的？从哪里开始呢？

‘Won’t you come back after you’ve changed?’ Baby Warren asked after a close scrutiny.
“你换好衣服就不回来了吗？”沃伦宝宝仔细观察后问道。

‘I haven’t got any change, except some shorts.’
“除了几条短裤，我没有任何零钱。”

As he trudged up to his hotel in a borrowed raincoat he kept laughing derisively in his throat.
当他穿着借来的雨衣艰难地走向旅馆时，他的喉咙里一直在嘲笑。

‘BIG chance—oh, yes. My God!—they decided to buy a doctor? Well, they better stick to whoever they’ve got in Chicago.’ Revolted by his harshness he made amends to Nicole, remembering that nothing had ever felt so young as her lips, remembering rain like tears shed for him that lay upon her softly shining porcelain cheeks ... the silence of the storm ceasing woke him about three o’clock and he went to the window. Her beauty climbed the rolling slope, it came into the room, rustling ghostlike through the curtains... .
“机会很大——哦，是的。天哪！——他们决定买一个医生？好吧，他们最好坚持在芝加哥遇到的任何人。”他对自己的严厉感到厌恶，他向妮可做出了弥补，记住没有什么比她的嘴唇更年轻的感觉了，记住雨就像为他流下的泪水，落在她身上，温柔地闪闪发光。瓷质的脸颊……大约三点钟，暴风雨停歇后的寂静把他吵醒了，他走到窗前。她的美貌爬上起伏的斜坡，进入房间，透过窗帘发出幽灵般的沙沙声……

... He climbed two thousand meters to Rochers de Naye the following morning, amused by the fact that his conductor of the day before was using his day off to climb also.
……第二天早上，他攀爬了两千米到达了 Rochers de Naye，他对前一天的指挥员也在利用休息日进行攀登感到很有趣。

Then Dick descended all the way to Montreux for a swim, got back to his hotel in time for dinner. Two notes awaited him.
然后迪克一路下降到蒙特勒游泳，及时回到酒店吃晚饭。有两张纸条在等着他。

‘I’m not ashamed about last night—it was the nicest thing that ever happened to me and even if I never saw you again, Mon Capitaine, I would be glad it happened.’
“我并不为昨晚的事情感到羞耻——这是我一生中发生过的最美好的事情，即使我再也见不到你了，我的船长，我也会很高兴这件事发生了。”

That was disarming enough—the heavy shade of Dohmler retreated as Dick opened the second envelope:
这已经足够解除戒心了——当迪克打开第二个信封时，多姆勒的浓重阴影退却了：

DEAR DOCTOR DIVER: I phoned but you were out. I wonder if I may ask you a great big favor. Unforeseen circumstances call me back to Paris, and I find I can make better time by way of Lausanne. Can you let Nicole ride as far as Zurich with you, since you are going back Monday? and drop her at the sanitarium? Is this too much to ask?
亲爱的潜水员医生： 我打电话了，但你出去了。我想知道是否可以请你帮一个大忙。不可预见的情况让我回到了巴黎，我发现通过洛桑我可以度过更好的时光。既然你周一要回去，你能让妮可和你一起骑车到苏黎世吗？然后把她送到疗养院？这个要求是否太过分了？

Sincerely,
真挚地，

BETH EVAN WARREN.
贝丝·埃文·沃伦。

Dick was furious—Miss Warren had known he had a bicycle with him; yet she had so phrased her note that it was impossible to refuse. Throw us together! Sweet propinquity and the Warren money!
迪克很生气——沃伦小姐知道他带着自行车；但她的便条措辞如此，让人无法拒绝。把我们扔在一起！甜蜜的邻近和沃伦的钱！

He was wrong; Baby Warren had no such intentions. She had looked Dick over with worldly eyes, she had measured him with the warped rule of an Anglophile and found him wanting—in spite of the fact that she found him toothsome. But for her he was too ‘intellectual’ and she pigeonholed him with a shabby-snobby crowd she had once known in London—he put himself out too much to be really of the correct stuff. She could not see how he could be made into her idea of an aristocrat.
他错了；他错了。小沃伦并没有这样的意图。她用世俗的眼光审视过迪克，用亲英派扭曲的统治来衡量他，发现他有缺陷——尽管事实上她发现他很美味。但对她来说，他太“知识分子”了，她把他归为她曾经在伦敦认识的一群衣衫褴褛、势利的人——他太过于表现出真正的正派。她看不出他怎么能成为她心目中的贵族。

In addition to that he was stubborn—she had seen him leave her conversation and get down behind his eyes in that odd way that people did, half a dozen times. She had not liked Nicole’s free and easy manner as a child and now she was sensibly habituated to thinking of her as a ‘gone coon”; and anyhow Doctor Diver was not the sort of medical man she could envisage in the family.
除此之外，他很固执——她见过他离开谈话，以人们所做的那种奇怪的方式低下头来，有六次了。她小时候并不喜欢妮可的洒脱，现在她已经习惯性地认为她是一个“失控的傻瓜”。无论如何，戴弗医生并不是她想象中的家庭医生。

She only wanted to use him innocently as a convenience.
她只是单纯地想利用他，作为一个便利而已。

But her request had the effect that Dick assumed she desired. A ride in a train can be a terrible, heavy-hearted or comic thing; it can be a trial flight; it can be a prefiguration of another journey just as a given day with a friend can be long, from the taste of hurry in the morning up to the realization of both being hungry and taking food together. Then comes the afternoon with the journey fading and dying, but quickening again at the end. Dick was sad to see Nicole’s meagre joy; yet it was a relief for her, going back to the only home she knew. They made no love that day, but when he left her outside the sad door on the Zurichsee and she turned and looked at him he knew her problem was one they had together for good now.
但她的请求产生了迪克认为她想要的效果。乘坐火车可能是一件可怕的、令人心情沉重的事情，也可能是一件滑稽的事情。可以是试飞；它可以是另一段旅程的预兆，就像和朋友在一起的一天可以很漫长，从早上匆忙的味道到意识到饥饿和一起吃饭。然后到了下午，旅程渐渐消逝，但最后又加速了。迪克看到妮可微薄的快乐感到很难过。然而，回到她唯一熟悉的家，对她来说是一种解脱。那天他们没有做爱，但当他把她留在苏黎世湖那扇悲伤的门外，她转过身看着他时，他知道她的问题是他们现在永远在一起的问题。

X

In Zurich in September Doctor Diver had tea with Baby Warren.
九月在苏黎世，戴弗医生与巴比·沃伦一起喝茶。

‘I think it’s ill advised,’ she said, ‘I’m not sure I truly understand your motives.’
“我认为这是不明智的，”她说，“我不确定我是否真正理解你的动机。”

‘Don’t let’s be unpleasant.’
“别让我们变得不愉快。”

‘After all I’m Nicole’s sister.’
“毕竟我是妮可的妹妹。”

‘That doesn’t give you the right to be unpleasant.’ It irritated Dick that he knew so much that he could not tell her. ‘Nicole’s rich, but that doesn’t make me an adventurer.’
“这并不意味着你有权利感到不愉快。”令迪克恼火的是，他知道得太多，却不能告诉她。 “妮可很富有，但这并不能让我成为冒险家。”

‘That’s just it,’ complained Baby stubbornly. ‘Nicole’s rich.’
“就是这样。”宝贝固执地抱怨道。 “妮可很有钱。”

‘Just how much money has she got?’ he asked.
“她到底有多少钱？”他问道。

She started; and with a silent laugh he continued, ‘You see how silly this is? I’d rather talk to some man in your family—‘
她开始;他默默地笑了笑，继续说道：“你知道这有多愚蠢吗？”我宁愿和你家里的某个男人谈谈——”

‘Everything’s been left to me,’ she persisted. ‘It isn’t we think you’re an adventurer. We don’t know who you are.’
“一切都留给我了，”她坚持道。 「我们并不认为你是冒险家。我们不知道你是谁。

‘I’m a doctor of medicine,’ he said. ‘My father is a clergyman, now retired. We lived in Buffalo and my past is open to investigation. I went to New Haven; afterward I was a Rhodes scholar. My great-grandfather was Governor of North Carolina and I’m a direct descendant of Mad Anthony Wayne.’
“我是一名医学博士，”他说。 “我的父亲是一名牧师，现已退休。我们住在布法罗，我的过去有待调查。我去了纽黑文；后来我成为了罗德学者。我的曾祖父是北卡罗来纳州州长，我是疯狂安东尼·韦恩的直系后裔。

‘Who was Mad Anthony Wayne?’ Baby asked suspiciously.
“疯子安东尼·韦恩是谁？”贝比疑惑地问道。

‘Mad Anthony Wayne?’
“疯狂的安东尼·韦恩？”

‘I think there’s enough madness in this affair.’
“我认为这件事已经足够疯狂了。”

He shook his head hopelessly, just as Nicole came out on the hotel terrace and looked around for them.
他绝望地摇摇头，这时妮可走上酒店的露台，四处寻找他们。

‘He was too mad to leave as much money as Marshall Field,’ he said.
“他太疯狂了，无法留下像马歇尔·菲尔德一样多的钱，”他说。

‘That’s all very well—‘
“那很好——”

Baby was right and she knew it. Face to face, her father would have it on almost any clergyman. They were an American ducal family without a title—the very name written in a hotel register, signed to an introduction, used in a difficult situation, caused a psychological metamorphosis in people, and in return this change had crystallized her own sense of position. She knew these facts from the English, who had known them for over two hundred years. But she did not know that twice Dick had come close to flinging the marriage in her face. All that saved it this time was Nicole finding their table and glowing away, white and fresh and new in the September afternoon.
宝贝是对的，她知道这一点。面对面时，她父亲几乎会把它戴在任何牧师身上。他们是一个没有头衔的美国公爵家庭——写在酒店登记簿上、签署在介绍上、在困难的情况下使用的名字，会引起人们的心理转变，而这种变化反过来又具体化了她自己的位置感。她从英国人那里知道了这些事实，英国人已经了解这些事实两百多年了。但她不知道迪克曾两次差点把这桩婚姻当着她的面扔掉。这次拯救了一切的是妮可找到了自己的桌子，在九月的下午，她容光焕发，洁白、清新、焕然一新。

How do you do, lawyer. We’re going to Como tomorrow for a week and then back to Zurich. That’s why I wanted you and sister to settle this, because it doesn’t matter to us how much I’m allowed. We’re going to live very quietly in Zurich for two years and Dick has enough to take care of us. No, Baby, I’m more practical than you think—It’s only for clothes and things I’ll need it... . Why, that’s more than—can the estate really afford to give me all that? I know I’ll never manage to spend it. Do you have that much? Why do you have more—is it because I’m supposed to be incompetent? All right, let my share pile up then... . No, Dick refuses to have anything whatever to do with it. I’ll have to feel bloated for us both... . Baby, you have no more idea of what Dick is like than, than—Now where do I sign? Oh, I’m sorry.
你好吗，律师。我们明天要去科莫一周，然后返回苏黎世。这就是为什么我希望你和姐姐解决这个问题，因为我被允许多少对我们来说并不重要。我们将在苏黎世安静地生活两年，迪克足以照顾我们。不，宝贝，我比你想象的更实际——只是为了衣服和我需要的东西……为什么，这不仅仅是——庄园真的有能力给我这一切吗？我知道我永远花不完。你有那么多吗？为什么你有更多——是因为我无能吗？好吧，那就让我的分享堆积起来吧……不，迪克拒绝与此有任何关系。我不得不为我们俩感到臃肿......宝贝，你对迪克的性格一无所知，只是——现在我该在哪里签名？哦，对不起。

... Isn’t it funny and lonely being together, Dick. No place to go except close. Shall we just love and love? Ah, but I love the most, and I can tell when you’re away from me, even a little. I think it’s wonderful to be just like everybody else, to reach out and find you all warm beside me in the bed.
……迪克，在一起是不是很有趣又很孤独。除了靠近没有地方可去。难道我们就这样爱着爱着吗？啊，但我最爱，当你离开我时我能感觉到，哪怕是一点点。我觉得能像其他人一样，伸出手去发现你们都温暖地躺在我身边，真是太棒了。

... If you will kindly call my husband at the hospital. Yes, the little book is selling everywhere—they want it published in six languages. I was to do the French translation but I’m tired these days—I’m afraid of falling, I’m so heavy and clumsy—like a broken roly-poly that can’t stand up straight. The cold stethoscope against my heart and my strongest feeling ‘Je m’en fiche de tout.’— Oh, that poor woman in the hospital with the blue baby, much better dead. Isn’t it fine there are three of us now?
...请您给我在医院的丈夫打电话。是的，这本小书到处畅销——他们希望它以六种语言出版。我本来要做法语翻译，但这些天我很累——我害怕摔倒，我又重又笨拙——就像一个坏了的不倒翁，站不直。冰冷的听诊器抵在我的心脏上，我最强烈的感觉是“Je m'en fiche de tout”。——哦，医院里那个带着蓝色婴儿的可怜女人，最好死了。现在我们三个人不是很好吗？

... That seems unreasonable, Dick—we have every reason for taking the bigger apartment. Why should we penalize ourselves just because there’s more Warren money than Diver money. Oh, thank you, cameriere, but we’ve changed our minds. This English clergyman tells us that your wine here in Orvieto is excellent. It doesn’t travel? That must be why we have never heard of it, because we love wine.
……这似乎不合理，迪克——我们完全有理由租更大的公寓。为什么我们要仅仅因为沃伦的钱多于潜水员的钱就惩罚自己呢？哦，谢谢你，cameriere，但我们改变了主意。这位英国牧师告诉我们，你们在奥尔维耶托的葡萄酒非常好。它不旅行吗？这一定是我们从未听说过它的原因，因为我们热爱葡萄酒。

The lakes are sunk in the brown clay and the slopes have all the creases of a belly. The photographer gave us the picture of me, my hair limp over the rail on the boat to Capri. ‘Good-by, Blue Grotte,’ sang the boatman, ‘come again soo-oon.’ And afterward tracing down the hot sinister shin of the Italian boot with the wind soughing around those eerie castles, the dead watching from up on those hills.
湖泊沉入棕色粘土中，山坡上布满了腹部的折痕。摄影师给了我们一张我的照片，我的头发软软地搭在去卡普里岛的船上的栏杆上。 “再见，蓝洞，”船夫唱道，“很快就会再来。”随后，随着风在那些怪异的城堡周围呼啸而过，死者们在山上注视着意大利靴子灼热而险恶的胫骨。 。

... This ship is nice, with our heels hitting the deck together. This is the blowy corner and each time we turn it I slant forward against the wind and pull my coat together without losing step with Dick. We are chanting nonsense:
……这艘船真好，我们的脚后跟一起踩在甲板上。这是风大的角落，每次我们转弯时，我都会逆风向前倾斜，把外套拉到一起，同时保持与迪克的同步。我们胡言乱语：

“Oh—oh—oh—oh
“哦——哦——哦——哦

Other flamingoes than me,
除了我以外还有其他火烈鸟，

Oh—oh—oh—oh
哦——哦——哦——哦

Other flamingoes than me—‘
除了我之外还有其他火烈鸟——”

Life is fun with Dick—the people in deck chairs look at us, and a woman is trying to hear what we are singing. Dick is tired of singing it, so go on alone, Dick. You will walk differently alone, dear, through a thicker atmosphere, forcing your way through the shadows of chairs, through the dripping smoke of the funnels. You will feel your own reflection sliding along the eyes of those who look at you. You are no longer insulated; but I suppose you must touch life in order to spring from it.
和迪克在一起的生活很有趣——躺椅上的人们看着我们，一个女人试图听听我们在唱什么。迪克厌倦了唱这首歌，所以独自一人继续吧，迪克。亲爱的，你会以不同的方式独自行走，穿过更浓重的气氛，穿过椅子的阴影，穿过烟囱滴下的烟雾。你会感觉到自己的倒影沿着那些看着你的人的眼睛滑动。你不再是孤立的；但我想你必须接触生活才能从中得到启发。

Sitting on the stanchion of this life-boat I look seaward and let my hair blow and shine. I am motionless against the sky and the boat is made to carry my form onward into the blue obscurity of the future, I am Pallas Athene carved reverently on the front of a galley. The waters are lapping in the public toilets and the agate green foliage of spray changes and complains about the stern.
我坐在救生艇的支柱上，看着大海，让我的头发随风飘扬，闪闪发亮。我在天空中一动不动，船是为了载着我的形状前进到未来的蓝色黑暗中而设计的，我是帕拉斯·雅典娜，虔诚地雕刻在厨房的前面。海水拍打着公共厕所，玛瑙绿的叶子喷出变化，抱怨着船尾。

... We travelled a lot that year—from Woolloomooloo Bay to Biskra. On the edge of the Sahara we ran into a plague of locusts and the chauffeur explained kindly that they were bumble-bees. The sky was low at night, full of the presence of a strange and watchful God. Oh, the poor little naked Ouled Naïl; the night was noisy with drums from Senegal and flutes and whining camels, and the natives pattering about in shoes made of old automobile tires.
……那一年我们旅行了很多地方——从乌鲁姆鲁湾到比斯克拉。在撒哈拉沙漠边缘，我们遇到了蝗灾，司机友善地解释说它们是大黄蜂。夜晚的天空很低，充满了一位陌生而警惕的上帝的存在。噢，可怜的赤身裸体的小乌尔德·奈尔；夜晚充满了来自塞内加尔的鼓声、笛子和哀鸣的骆驼，当地人穿着旧汽车轮胎制成的鞋子，叽叽喳喳地走来走去。

But I was gone again by that time—trains and beaches they were all one. That was why he took me travelling but after my second child, my little girl, Topsy, was born everything got dark again.
但那时我又离开了——火车和海滩合而为一。这就是他带我旅行的原因，但在我的第二个孩子，我的小女儿托普西出生后，一切又变得黑暗了。

... If I could get word to my husband who has seen fit to desert me here, to leave me in the hands of incompetents. You tell me my baby is black—that’s farcical, that’s very cheap. We went to Africa merely to see Timgad, since my principal interest in life is archeology. I am tired of knowing nothing and being reminded of it all the time.
……如果我能通知我的丈夫，他认为他应该把我抛弃在这里，把我留在无能的人手中。你告诉我我的孩子是黑人——这太荒唐了，这太廉价了。我们去非洲只是为了看看蒂姆加德，因为我生活的主要兴趣是考古学。我厌倦了一无所知并总是被提醒。

... When I get well I want to be a fine person like you, Dick—I would study medicine except it’s too late. We must spend my money and have a house—I’m tired of apartments and waiting for you. You’re bored with Zurich and you can’t find time for writing here and you say that it’s a confession of weakness for a scientist not to write. And I’ll look over the whole field of knowledge and pick out something and really know about it, so I’ll have it to hang on to if I go to pieces again. You’ll help me, Dick, so I won’t feel so guilty. We’ll live near a warm beach where we can be brown and young together.
……当我康复后，我想成为一个像你一样的好人，迪克——我会学习医学，但为时已晚。我们必须花我的钱买房子——我厌倦了公寓和等你。你对苏黎世感到厌倦，你找不到时间在这里写作，你说作为一个科学家不写作就是对软弱的坦白。我会审视整个知识领域，挑出一些东西，真正了解它，这样，当我再次崩溃时，我就能抓住它。迪克，你会帮助我，这样我就不会感到那么内疚了。我们将住在温暖的海滩附近，在那里我们可以一起晒黑、晒太阳。

... This is going to be Dick’s work house. Oh, the idea came to us both at the same moment. We had passed Tarmes a dozen times and we rode up here and found the houses empty, except two stables. When we bought we acted through a Frenchman but the navy sent spies up here in no time when they found that Americans had bought part of a hill village. They looked for cannons all through the building material, and finally Baby had to twitch wires for us at the Affaires Etrangères in Paris.
...这将是迪克的工作室。哦，我们俩同时想到了这个主意。我们已经经过塔尔梅斯十几次了，我们骑马来到这里，发现除了两个马厩外，房子空无一人。当我们购买时，我们是通过一名法国人行事的，但当海军发现美国人购买了一个山村的一部分时，他们立即派了间谍到这里。他们在整个建筑材料中寻找大炮，最后贝比不得不在巴黎的 Affaires Etrangères 为我们拉电线。

No one comes to the Riviera in summer, so we expect to have a few guests and to work. There are some French people here—Mistinguet last week, surprised to find the hotel open, and Picasso and the man who wrote Pas sur la Bouche.
夏天没有人来里维埃拉，所以我们预计会有一些客人并工作。这里有一些法国人——上周的米斯汀格特，惊讶地发现酒店开门了，还有毕加索和《Pas sur la Bouche》的作者。

... Dick, why did you register Mr. and Mrs. Diver instead of Doctor and Mrs. Diver? I just wondered—it just floated through my mind.—You’ve taught me that work is everything and I believe you. You used to say a man knows things and when he stops knowing things he’s like anybody else, and the thing is to get power before he stops knowing things. If you want to turn things topsy-turvy, all right, but must your Nicole follow you walking on her hands, darling?
...迪克，为什么你注册的是戴弗先生和夫人，而不是戴弗医生和夫人？我只是想知道——它只是浮现在我的脑海里——你教会了我工作就是一切，我相信你。你曾经说过，一个人知道一些事情，当他不再知道一些事情时，他就和其他人一样了，而问题是在他停止知道一些事情之前获得权力。如果你想把事情搞得天翻地覆，那好吧，但是亲爱的，你的妮可必须跟着你走路吗？

... Tommy says I am silent. Since I was well the first time I talked a lot to Dick late at night, both of us sitting up in bed and lighting cigarettes, then diving down afterward out of the blue dawn and into the pillows, to keep the light from our eyes. Sometimes I sing, and play with the animals, and I have a few friends too—Mary, for instance. When Mary and I talk neither of us listens to the other. Talk is men. When I talk I say to myself that I am probably Dick. Already I have even been my son, remembering how wise and slow he is. Sometimes I am Doctor Dohmler and one time I may even be an aspect of you, Tommy Barban. Tommy is in love with me, I think, but gently, reassuringly. Enough, though, so that he and Dick have begun to disapprove of each other. All in all, everything has never gone better. I am among friends who like me. I am here on this tranquil beach with my husband and two children. Everything is all right—if I can finish translating this damn recipe for chicken a la Maryland into French. My toes feel warm in the sand.
...汤米说我沉默。因为我第一次在深夜和迪克聊了很多，所以我俩都坐在床上，点燃香烟，然后从蓝色的黎明中潜入枕头，以防止光线照射到我们的眼睛。有时我唱歌，和动物玩耍，我也有一些朋友——例如玛丽。当玛丽和我说话时，我们谁也不听对方说话。说话的是男人。当我说话时，我对自己说我可能就是迪克。我什至已经成为我的儿子了，记得他是多么聪明和迟钝。有时我是多姆勒医生，有时我什至可能是你的一部分，汤米·巴尔班。我想，汤米爱上了我，但爱的方式是温柔的、令人安心的。不过，这已经足够让他和迪克开始互相不赞成了。总而言之，一切都变得前所未有的好。我是喜欢我的朋友之一。我和我的丈夫以及两个孩子来到了这个宁静的海滩。一切都好——如果我能把这个该死的马里兰州鸡肉食谱翻译成法语的话。我的脚趾在沙子里感觉温暖。

‘Yes, I’ll look. More new people—oh, that girl—yes. Who did you say she looked like... . No, I haven’t, we don’t get much chance to see the new American pictures over here. Rosemary who? Well, we’re getting very fashionable for July—seems very peculiar to me. Yes, she’s lovely, but there can be too many people.’
‘是的，我会看看。更多新朋友——哦，那个女孩——是的。你说她像谁……不，我没有，我们在这里没有太多机会看到新的美国照片。迷迭香是谁？嗯，七月我们变得非常时尚——对我来说似乎很奇怪。是的，她很可爱，但是人太多了。”

XI

Doctor Richard Diver and Mrs. Elsie Speers sat in the Café des Alliées in August, under cool and dusty trees. The sparkle of the mica was dulled by the baked ground, and a few gusts of mistral from down the coast seeped through the Esterel and rocked the fishing boats in the harbor, pointing the masts here and there at a featureless sky.
八月，理查德·戴弗医生和埃尔西·斯皮尔斯夫人坐在联盟咖啡馆里，坐在凉爽、布满灰尘的树下。云母的光芒因烘烤的地面而变得暗淡，几股密斯塔拉风从海岸吹来，穿过埃斯特雷尔河，摇晃着港口里的渔船，让桅杆四处指向毫无特色的天空。

‘I had a letter this morning,’ said Mrs. Speers. ‘What a terrible time you all must have had with those Negroes! But Rosemary said you were perfectly wonderful to her.’
“今天早上我收到一封信，”斯皮尔斯夫人说。 ‘你们和那些黑人一起度过了多么可怕的时光啊！但罗斯玛丽说你对她来说非常好。”

‘Rosemary ought to have a service stripe. It was pretty harrowing— the only person it didn’t disturb was Abe North—he flew off to Havre—he probably doesn’t know about it yet.’
“迷迭香应该有一条服务条纹。这非常令人痛苦——唯一没有打扰的人是阿贝·诺斯——他飞到了阿弗尔——他可能还不知道这件事。

‘I’m sorry Mrs. Diver was upset,’ she said carefully.
“我很抱歉戴弗夫人感到不安，”她小心翼翼地说。

Rosemary had written:
迷迭香写道：

Nicole seemed Out of her Mind. I didn’t want to come South with them because I felt Dick had enough on his hands.
妮可似乎疯了。我不想和他们一起去南方，因为我觉得迪克手头的事情已经够多了。

‘She’s all right now.’ He spoke almost impatiently. ‘So you’re leaving to-morrow. When will you sail?’
“她现在没事了。”他几乎不耐烦地说道。 “所以你明天就要离开。”你什么时候启航？

‘Right away.’
'马上。'

‘My God, it’s awful to have you go.’
“天哪，你走了真是太糟糕了。”

‘We’re glad we came here. We’ve had a good time, thanks to you. You’re the first man Rosemary ever cared for.’
‘我们很高兴来到这里。我们度过了一段愉快的时光，谢谢你。你是罗斯玛丽关心的第一个男人。

Another gust of wind strained around the porphyry hills of la Napoule. There was a hint in the air that the earth was hurrying on toward other weather; the lush midsummer moment outside of time was already over.
又一阵风吹过拉纳普尔的斑岩山丘。空气中有一种暗示，地球正急速走向另一种天气。时间之外郁郁葱葱的仲夏时刻已经结束了。

‘Rosemary’s had crushes but sooner or later she always turned the man over to me—‘ Mrs. Speers laughed, ‘—for dissection.’
“罗斯玛丽曾经暗恋过他，但她迟早总会把这个男人交给我——”斯皮尔斯夫人笑道，“——让我解剖。”

‘So I was spared.’
“所以我才幸免于难。”

‘There was nothing I could have done. She was in love with you before I ever saw you. I told her to go ahead.’
‘我无能为力。在我见到你之前，她就已经爱上你了。我告诉她继续。

He saw that no provision had been made for him, or for Nicole, in Mrs. Speers’ plans—and he saw that her amorality sprang from the conditions of her own withdrawal. It was her right, the pension on which her own emotions had retired. Women are necessarily capable of almost anything in their struggle for survival and can scarcely be convicted of such man-made crimes as ‘cruelty.’ So long as the shuffle of love and pain went on within proper walls Mrs. Speers could view it with as much detachment and humor as a eunuch. She had not even allowed for the possibility of Rosemary’s being damaged—or was she certain that she couldn’t be?
他看到斯皮尔斯夫人的计划中没有为他或妮可做出任何规定——而且他看到她的不道德行为源于她自己的退出条件。这是她的权利，是她自己的情感得以退休的养老金。在为生存而奋斗的过程中，女性几乎可以做任何事情，而且几乎不会被判犯有“残忍”等人为罪行。只要爱与痛苦的洗牌在适当的围墙内进行，斯皮尔斯夫人就可以用同样的态度来看待它。太监的超然和幽默。她甚至没有考虑到罗斯玛丽受到伤害的可能性——或者她确信自己不会受到伤害？

‘If what you say is true I don’t think it did her any harm.’ He was keeping up to the end the pretense that he could still think objectively about Rosemary. ‘She’s over it already. Still—so many of the important times in life begin by seeming incidental.’
“如果你说的是真的，我认为这不会对她造成任何伤害。”他一直假装自己仍然可以客观地思考罗斯玛丽。 ‘她已经结束了。尽管如此，生命中的许多重要时刻都是从看似偶然开始的。

‘This wasn’t incidental,’ Mrs. Speers insisted. ‘You were the first man—you’re an ideal to her. In every letter she says that.’
“这并非偶然，”斯皮尔斯夫人坚称。 “你是第一个男人——你是她的理想。”她在每封信中都这么说。

‘She’s so polite.’
“她很有礼貌。”

‘You and Rosemary are the politest people I’ve ever known, but she means this.’
“你和罗斯玛丽是我认识的最有礼貌的人，但她是认真的。”

‘My politeness is a trick of the heart.’
“我的礼貌是内心的把戏。”

This was partly true. From his father Dick had learned the somewhat conscious good manners of the young Southerner coming north after the Civil War. Often he used them and just as often he despised them because they were not a protest against how unpleasant selfishness was but against how unpleasant it looked.
这在一定程度上是正确的。迪克从他父亲那里学到了内战后来到北方的年轻南方人多少有意识的礼貌。他经常使用它们，也经常鄙视它们，因为它们不是抗议自私是多么令人不快，而是抗议它看起来多么令人不愉快。

‘I’m in love with Rosemary,’ he told her suddenly. ‘It’s a kind of self-indulgence saying that to you.’
“我爱上了罗斯玛丽，”他突然告诉她。 “对你这么说是一种自我放纵。”

It seemed very strange and official to him, as if the very tables and chairs in the Café des Alliées would remember it forever. Already he felt her absence from these skies: on the beach he could only remember the sun-torn flesh of her shoulder; at Tarmes he crushed out her footprints as he crossed the garden; and now the orchestra launching into the Nice Carnival Song, an echo of last year’s vanished gaieties, started the little dance that went on all about her. In a hundred hours she had come to possess all the world’s dark magic; the blinding belladonna, the caffein converting physical into nervous energy, the mandragora that imposes harmony.
对他来说，这似乎非常奇怪和正式，仿佛联盟咖啡馆的桌椅都会永远记住它。他已经感觉到她已经离开了这片天空：在海滩上，他只记得她肩膀上被太阳晒伤的肉；在海滩上，他只记得她肩膀上被太阳晒伤的肉；在塔尔梅斯，他穿过花园时踩碎了她的脚印。现在管弦乐队奏起了美妙的嘉年华歌曲，这是对去年消失的欢乐的回响，开始了围绕着她的小舞蹈。在一百小时内，她已经掌握了世界上所有的黑暗魔法。令人眼花缭乱的颠茄，将体力转化为神经能量的咖啡因，以及带来和谐的曼陀罗。

With an effort he once more accepted the fiction that he shared Mrs. Speers’ detachment.
经过一番努力，他再次接受了这样的事实：他和斯皮尔斯夫人一样冷漠。

‘You and Rosemary aren’t really alike,’ he said. ‘The wisdom she got from you is all molded up into her persona, into the mask she faces the world with. She doesn’t think; her real depths are Irish and romantic and illogical.’
“你和罗斯玛丽其实并不相似，”他说。 “她从你那里得到的智慧都融入了她的人格，融入了她面对世界的面具。”她不认为；她真正的深度是爱尔兰式的、浪漫的、不合逻辑的。”

Mrs. Speers knew too that Rosemary, for all her delicate surface, was a young mustang, perceptibly by Captain Doctor Hoyt, U.S.A. Cross-sectioned, Rosemary would have displayed an enormous heart, liver and soul, all crammed close together under the lovely shell.
斯皮尔斯夫人也知道，罗斯玛丽虽然外表精致，但却是一匹年轻的野马，被美国霍伊特博士船长明显地察觉到。将罗斯玛丽剖开后，会展现出一颗巨大的心脏、肝脏和灵魂，所有这些都在可爱的外壳下紧密地挤在一起。 。

Saying good-by, Dick was aware of Elsie Speers’ full charm, aware that she meant rather more to him than merely a last unwillingly relinquished fragment of Rosemary. He could possibly have made up Rosemary—he could never have made up her mother. If the cloak, spurs and brilliants in which Rosemary had walked off were things with which he had endowed her, it was nice in contrast to watch her mother’s grace knowing it was surely something he had not evoked. She had an air of seeming to wait, as if for a man to get through with something more important than herself, a battle or an operation, during which he must not be hurried or interfered with. When the man had finished she would be waiting, without fret or impatience, somewhere on a highstool, turning the pages of a newspaper.
道别时，迪克意识到埃尔西·斯皮尔斯的全部魅力，意识到她对他来说意义重大，而不仅仅是迷迭香最后一个不情愿放弃的片段。他可能编造了罗斯玛丽——他永远不可能编造出她的母亲。如果罗斯玛丽离开时穿着的斗篷、马刺和亮片都是他赋予她的东西，那么看到她母亲的优雅，知道这肯定不是他唤起的，形成鲜明对比，真是太好了。她的神态似乎在等待，仿佛在等待一个男人完成比自己更重要的事情，无论是一场战斗还是一次行动，在这期间他不能匆忙或干涉。当那个男人完成后，她会毫无烦恼或不耐烦地在高脚凳上等待，翻着报纸。

‘Good-by—and I want you both to remember always how fond of you Nicole and I have grown.’
“再见——我希望你们永远记住妮可和我是多么喜欢你们。”

Back at the Villa Diana, he went to his work-room, and opened the shutters, closed against the mid-day glare. On his two long tables, in ordered confusion, lay the materials of his book. Volume I, concerned with Classification, had achieved some success in a small subsidized edition. He was negotiating for its reissue. Volume II was to be a great amplification of his first little book, A Psychology for Psychiatrists. Like so many men he had found that he had only one or two ideas—that his little collection of pamphlets now in its fiftieth German edition contained the germ of all he would ever think or know.
回到戴安娜别墅，他走进自己的工作室，打开百叶窗，将正午的强光关上。他的两张长桌上，杂乱地摆放着他的书的材料。第一卷涉及分类，在小型补贴版中取得了一些成功。他正在就重新发行该书进行谈判。第二卷是对他的第一本小书《精神病学家心理学》的极大扩充。像许多人一样，他发现自己只有一两个想法——他那本小册子现在有第五十版德文版，包含了他所想到或知道的一切的萌芽。

But he was currently uneasy about the whole thing. He resented the wasted years at New Haven, but mostly he felt a discrepancy between the growing luxury in which the Divers lived, and the need for display which apparently went along with it. Remembering his Rumanian friend’s story, about the man who had worked for years on the brain of an armadillo, he suspected that patient Germans were sitting close to the libraries of Berlin and Vienna callously anticipating him. He had about decided to brief the work in its present condition and publish it in an undocumented volume of a hundred thousand words as an introduction to more scholarly volumes to follow.
但他现在对整件事感到不安。他对在纽黑文浪费的岁月感到不满，但最重要的是，他感到戴弗一家日益奢华的生活与显然与之相伴的展示需求之间存在着差异。想起他的罗马尼亚朋友的故事，关于一个人多年来研究犰狳大脑的故事，他怀疑耐心的德国人正坐在柏林和维也纳的图书馆附近，冷漠地等待着他。他几乎决定简要介绍这部作品的现状，并将其以十万字的无文献卷的形式出版，作为后续更多学术著作的介绍。

He confirmed this decision walking around the rays of late afternoon in his work-room. With the new plan he could be through by spring. It seemed to him that when a man with his energy was pursued for a year by increasing doubts, it indicated some fault in the plan.
他在午后的工作室里走着，确认了这个决定。按照新计划，他可以在春天之前度过难关。在他看来，当一个像他这样精力充沛的人一年来受到越来越多的怀疑的追捕时，就表明计划出了问题。

He laid the bars of gilded metal that he used as paperweights along the sheaves of notes. He swept up, for no servant was allowed in here, treated his washroom sketchily with Bon Ami, repaired a screen and sent off an order to a publishing house in Zurich. Then he drank an ounce of gin with twice as much water.
他把用作镇纸的镀金金属条放在一捆钞票上。他打扫了一遍，因为这里不允许仆人进来，他和好朋友粗略地打理了他的洗手间，修理了一个屏风，并向苏黎世的一家出版社发出了一份订单。然后他喝了一盎司杜松子酒和两倍的水。

He saw Nicole in the garden. Presently he must encounter her and the prospect gave him a leaden feeling. Before her he must keep up a perfect front, now and to-morrow, next week and next year. All night in Paris he had held her in his arms while she slept light under the luminol; in the early morning he broke in upon her confusion before it could form, with words of tenderness and protection, and she slept again with his face against the warm scent of her hair. Before she woke he had arranged everything at the phone in the next room. Rosemary was to move to another hotel. She was to be ‘Daddy’s Girl’ and even to give up saying good-by to them. The proprietor of the hotel, Mr. McBeth, was to be the three Chinese monkeys. Packing amid the piled boxes and tissue paper of many purchases, Dick and Nicole left for the Riviera at noon.
他在花园里看到了妮可。现在他必须见到她了，这个前景给他一种沉重的感觉。在她面前，他必须保持完美的外表，现在、明天、下周和明年。在巴黎的整个晚上，他都把她搂在怀里，而她则在鲁米诺的照射下睡得很浅。清晨，他在她的困惑形成之前用温柔和保护的话语打断了她，她又睡着了，他的脸贴着她头发温暖的香味。在她醒来之前，他已经通过隔壁房间的电话安排好了一切。罗斯玛丽要搬到另一家酒店。她要成为“爸爸的女儿”，甚至要放弃与他们道别。酒店的老板麦克贝斯先生就是三只中国猴。中午，迪克和妮可在一堆堆的盒子和纸巾中收拾好行李，出发前往里维埃拉。

Then there was a reaction. As they settled down in the wagon-lit Dick saw that Nicole was waiting for it, and it came quickly and desperately, before the train was out of the ceinture—his only instinct was to step off while the train was still going slow, rush back and see where Rosemary was, what she was doing. He opened a book and bent his pince-nez upon it, aware that Nicole was watching him from her pillow across the compartment. Unable to read, he pretended to be tired and shut his eyes but she was still watching him, and though still she was half asleep from the hangover of the drug, she was relieved and almost happy that he was hers again.
然后就有了反应。当他们在车灯照亮的车厢里安顿下来时，迪克看到妮可正在等它，而它来得又快又绝望，在火车开出终点站之前——他唯一的本能就是在火车仍然开得很慢、很急的时候下车。回来看看罗斯玛丽在哪里，她在做什么。他打开一本书，把夹鼻眼镜放在上面，意识到妮可正在隔间的枕头上看着他。他无法读书，假装很累，闭上了眼睛，但她仍在注视着他，虽然她仍因药物的宿醉而处于半睡半醒的状态，但她松了一口气，几乎很高兴他又是她的了。

It was worse with his eyes shut for it gave a rhythm of finding and losing, finding and losing; but so as not to appear restless he lay like that until noon. At luncheon things were better—it was always a fine meal; a thousand lunches in inns and restaurants, wagon-lits, buffets, and aeroplanes were a mighty collation to have taken together. The familiar hurry of the train waiters, the little bottles of wine and mineral water, the excellent food of the Paris-Lyons-Méditerranee gave them the illusion that everything was the same as before, but it was almost the first trip he had ever taken with Nicole that was a going away rather than a going toward. He drank a whole bottle of wine save for Nicole’s single glass; they talked about the house and the children. But once back in the compartment a silence fell over them like the silence in the restaurant across from the Luxembourg. Receding from a grief, it seems necessary to retrace the same steps that brought us there. An unfamiliar impatience settled on Dick; suddenly Nicole said:
当他闭上眼睛时，情况更糟，因为它给人一种寻找和失去、寻找和失去的节奏；但为了不显得焦躁不安，他就这样躺到中午。午餐时情况好多了——总是一顿美餐。在旅馆和餐馆、马车、自助餐和飞机上吃的一千顿午餐是一个巨大的组合。火车服务员熟悉的匆忙，小瓶装的葡萄酒和矿泉水，巴黎-里昂-地中海的美味佳肴，让他们有一种一切都和以前一样的错觉，但这几乎是他第一次旅行对妮可来说，那是一种远离而不是走向。除了妮可的一杯酒之外，他喝掉了一整瓶酒；他们谈论房子和孩子。但回到车厢后，他们陷入了一片寂静，就像卢森堡对面餐厅里的寂静一样。从悲痛中走出来后，似乎有必要重温当年的脚步。迪克感到一种不寻常的不耐烦。妮可突然说道：

‘It seemed too bad to leave Rosemary like that—do you suppose she’ll be all right?’
“就这样离开罗斯玛丽似乎太糟糕了——你认为她会没事吗？”

‘Of course. She could take care of herself anywhere—‘ Lest this belittle Nicole’s ability to do likewise, he added, ‘After all, she’s an actress, and even though her mother’s in the background she HAS to look out for herself.’
'当然。她可以在任何地方照顾自己——以免这贬低妮可的能力，他补充道，“毕竟，她是一名演员，即使她母亲在幕后，她也必须照顾自己。”

‘She’s very attractive.’
“她非常有魅力。”

‘She’s an infant.’
“她还是个婴儿。”

‘She’s attractive though.’
“不过她很有吸引力。”

They talked aimlessly back and forth, each speaking for the other.
他们漫无目的地聊着天，各自为对方说话。

‘She’s not as intelligent as I thought,’ Dick offered.
“她不像我想象的那么聪明，”迪克说道。

‘She’s quite smart.’
“她很聪明。”

‘Not very, though—there’s a persistent aroma of the nursery.’
“不过不太好——苗圃里有一股持久的香味。”

‘She’s very—very pretty,’ Nicole said in a detached, emphatic way, ‘and I thought she was very good in the picture.’
“她非常非常漂亮，”妮可以一种超然、强调的方式说道，“我认为她在照片中表现得非常好。”

‘She was well directed. Thinking it over, it wasn’t very individual.’
‘她的指导很好。仔细想想，这不是很有个性。”

‘I thought it was. I can see how she’d be very attractive to men.’
” “我以为是的。我可以看出她对男人来说非常有吸引力。

His heart twisted. To what men? How many men?
他的心扭曲了。对什么男人？有多少男人？

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?
——你介意我把窗帘拉下来吗？

—Please do, it’s too light in here.
——请这样做，这里太亮了。

Where now? And with whom?
现在在哪里？和谁一起？

‘In a few years she’ll look ten years older than you.’
“几年后，她看起来就会比你老十岁。”

‘On the contrary. I sketched her one night on a theatre program, I think she’ll last.’
'相反。有一天晚上，我在一个戏剧节目中为她画了素描，我想她会持续下去。

They were both restless in the night. In a day or two Dick would try to banish the ghost of Rosemary before it became walled up with them, but for the moment he had no force to do it. Sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than of a pleasure and the memory so possessed him that for the moment there was nothing to do but to pretend. This was more difficult because he was currently annoyed with Nicole, who, after all these years, should recognize symptoms of strain in herself and guard against them. Twice within a fortnight she had broken up: there had been the night of the dinner at Tarmes when he had found her in her bedroom dissolved in crazy laughter telling Mrs. McKisco she could not go in the bathroom because the key was thrown down the well. Mrs. McKisco was astonished and resentful, baffled and yet in a way comprehending. Dick had not been particularly alarmed then, for afterward Nicole was repentant. She called at Gausse’s Hotel but the McKiscos were gone.
夜里，两人都心神不宁。一两天后，迪克会试图在罗斯玛丽的鬼魂被他们围困之前将其驱逐，但目前他没有力量这样做。有时候，摆脱痛苦比摆脱快乐更难，而记忆如此占据他，以至于此刻除了假装之外别无他法。这更困难，因为他现在对妮可很恼火，这么多年过去了，妮可应该认识到自己紧张的症状并加以防范。两周之内，她两次分手：有一次在塔尔姆斯吃晚饭的那天晚上，他发现她在卧室里，疯狂地大笑，告诉麦基斯科太太她不能去浴室，因为钥匙被扔进了井里。 。麦基斯科夫人感到惊讶、愤恨、困惑，但又有些理解。迪克当时并没有特别惊慌，因为后来妮可悔悟了。她到高斯旅馆打电话，但麦基斯科夫妇已经走了。

The collapse in Paris was another matter, adding significance to the first one. It prophesied possibly a new cycle, a new pousse of the malady. Having gone through unprofessional agonies during her long relapse following Topsy’s birth, he had, perforce, hardened himself about her, making a cleavage between Nicole sick and Nicole well. This made it difficult now to distinguish between his selfprotective professional detachment and some new coldness in his heart. As an indifference cherished, or left to atrophy, becomes an emptiness, to this extent he had learned to become empty of Nicole, serving her against his will with negations and emotional neglect. One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it.
巴黎的崩溃是另一回事，它为第一个问题增添了意义。它可能预示着一种新的循环，一种新的疾病。托普西出生后，她的病情长期复发，在经历了非专业的痛苦之后，他不得不对她表现得冷酷无情，在妮可生病和妮可良好之间产生了分歧。这让他现在很难区分他自我保护的职业超然和他内心新出现的冷漠。当一种所珍视的冷漠，或者任其萎缩，变成一种空虚时，他已经学会了对妮可变得空虚，用否定和情感忽视来违背自己的意愿来服务她。有人写道伤疤已痊愈，这与皮肤的病理学松散平行，但在个人的生活中却没有这样的事情。有开放性伤口，有时缩小到针刺大小，但伤口仍然存在。痛苦的痕迹更类似于失去一根手指或失去一只眼睛。我们也许一年中不会错过他们一分钟，但如果我们错过了，也无能为力。

十二

He found Nicole in the garden with her arms folded high on her shoulders. She looked at him with straight gray eyes, with a child’s searching wonder.
他在花园里发现妮可，她双臂高高地交叉在肩上。她用一双笔直的灰色眼睛看着他，带着孩子般的好奇心。

‘I went to Cannes,’ he said. ‘I ran into Mrs. Speers. She’s leaving to-morrow. She wanted to come up and say good-by to you, but I slew the idea.’
“我去了戛纳，”他说。 “我遇到了斯皮尔斯夫人。她明天就要离开。她想上来和你告别，但我打消了这个念头。

‘I’m sorry. I’d like to have seen her. I like her.’
'对不起。我很想见见她。我喜欢她。'

‘Who else do you think I saw—Bartholomew Tailor.’
“你认为我还看到了谁——巴塞洛缪·泰勒。”

‘You didn’t.’
“你没有。”

‘I couldn’t have missed that face of his, the old experienced weasel. He was looking over the ground for Ciro’s Menagerie— they’ll all be down next year. I suspected Mrs. Abrams was a sort of outpost.’
“我不可能错过他那张脸，那是一只经验丰富的老黄鼠狼。”他正在地上寻找西罗的动物园——明年它们都会倒塌。我怀疑艾布拉姆斯夫人是某种前哨基地。

‘And Baby was outraged the first summer we came here.’
“我们来到这里的第一个夏天，宝贝很愤怒。”

‘They don’t really give a damn where they are, so I don’t see why they don’t stay and freeze in Deauville.’
“他们根本不在乎自己在哪里，所以我不明白他们为什么不留在多维尔冻僵。”

‘Can’t we start rumors about cholera or something?’
“我们不能散播有关霍乱之类的谣言吗？”

‘I told Bartholomew that some categories died off like flies here— I told him the life of a suck was as short as the life of a machine-gunner in the war.’
“我告诉巴塞洛缪，有些类别在这里像苍蝇一样消失了——我告诉他，傻瓜的生命就像战争中机枪手的生命一样短暂。”

‘You didn’t.’
“你没有。”

‘No, I didn’t,’ he admitted. ‘He was very pleasant. It was a beautiful sight, he and I shaking hands there on the boulevard. The meeting of Sigmund Freud and Ward McAllister.’
“不，我没有，”他承认。 ‘他非常令人愉快。这是一个美丽的景象，他和我在林荫大道上握手。西格蒙德·弗洛伊德和沃德·麦卡利斯特的会面。

Dick didn’t want to talk—he wanted to be alone so that his thoughts about work and the future would overpower his thoughts of love and to-day. Nicole knew about it but only darkly and tragically, hating him a little in an animal way, yet wanting to rub against his shoulder.
迪克不想说话——他想一个人呆着，这样他对工作和未来的想法就会压倒他对爱情和今天的想法。妮可知道这一点，但只是阴暗而悲惨，有点像动物一样恨他，却又想蹭他的肩膀。

‘The darling,’ Dick said lightly.
“亲爱的，”迪克轻声说。

He went into the house, forgetting something he wanted to do there, and then remembering it was the piano. He sat down whistling and played by ear:
他走进屋子，忘记了自己想做的事，然后才想起那是钢琴。他坐下来吹着口哨，随耳吹奏：

“Just picture you upon my knee
“想象一下你坐在我的膝盖上

With tea for two and two for tea
两人茶和两人茶

And me for you and you for me—‘
我为你，你为我——”

Through the melody flowed a sudden realization that Nicole, hearing it, would guess quickly at a nostalgia for the past fortnight. He broke off with a casual chord and left the piano.
旋律中流淌着一种突然的意识到，妮可听到这首歌，很快就会猜测出对过去两周的怀念。他随手弹奏了一个和弦，然后离开了钢琴。

It was hard to know where to go. He glanced about the house that Nicole had made, that Nicole’s grandfather had paid for. He owned only his work house and the ground on which it stood. Out of three thousand a year and what dribbled in from his publications he paid for his clothes and personal expenses, for cellar charges, and for Lanier’s education, so far confined to a nurse’s wage. Never had a move been contemplated without Dick’s figuring his share. Living rather ascetically, travelling third-class when he was alone, with the cheapest wine, and good care of his clothes, and penalizing himself for any extravagances, he maintained a qualified financial independence. After a certain point, though, it was difficult— again and again it was necessary to decide together as to the uses to which Nicole’s money should be put. Naturally Nicole, wanting to own him, wanting him to stand still forever, encouraged any slackness on his part, and in multiplying ways he was constantly inundated by a trickling of goods and money. The inception of the idea of the cliff villa which they had elaborated as a fantasy one day was a typical example of the forces divorcing them from the first simple arrangements in Zurich.
很难知道该去哪里。他扫视了一下妮可建造的房子，那是妮可的祖父出钱建造的。他只拥有自己的工作室和工作室所在的土地。每年从他的出版物中拿出三千块钱，他用来支付他的衣服和个人开支、地窖费用和拉尼尔的教育费用，到目前为止，他的工资仅限于护士的工资。迪克从来没有考虑过自己的份额，而没有考虑过采取任何行动。他过着苦行僧般的生活，独自旅行时乘坐三等舱，带着最便宜的酒，精心保养自己的衣服，并惩罚自己的奢侈行为，保持了一定的经济独立。然而，到了一定程度之后，事情就变得困难了——需要一次又一次地共同决定妮可的钱应该用来做什么。自然地，妮可想要拥有他，想要他永远站在原地，鼓励他的任何懈怠，并以多种方式不断地被源源不断的商品和金钱淹没。有一天，他们将悬崖别墅的想法阐述为一种幻想，这一想法的开始就是使他们脱离苏黎世最初的简单安排的力量的典型例子。

‘Wouldn’t it be fun if—‘ it had been; and then, ‘Won’t it be fun when—‘
“如果——”是的，那不是很有趣吗？然后，‘这不是很有趣吗——’

It was not so much fun. His work became confused with Nicole’s problems; in addition, her income had increased so fast of late that it seemed to belittle his work. Also, for the purpose of her cure, he had for many years pretended to a rigid domesticity from which he was drifting away, and this pretense became more arduous in this effortless immobility, in which he was inevitably subjected to microscopic examination. When Dick could no longer play what he wanted to play on the piano, it was an indication that life was being refined down to a point. He stayed in the big room a long time listening to the buzz of the electric clock, listening to time.
没那么有趣。他的工作与妮可的问题混淆了。此外，她的收入最近增长得如此之快，以至于似乎贬低了他的工作。而且，为了治愈她的病，他多年来一直假装过着一种刻板的家庭生活，而他正在逐渐摆脱这种家庭生活，而这种假装在这种毫不费力的静止状态中变得更加困难，在这种状态下，他不可避免地要接受显微镜检查。当迪克无法再在钢琴上弹奏他想弹奏的曲子时，就表明生活正在被精炼到一定程度。他在大房间里呆了很久，听着电钟的嗡嗡声，听着时间。

In November the waves grew black and dashed over the sea wall onto the shore road—such summer life as had survived disappeared and the beaches were melancholy and desolate under the mistral and rain. Gausse’s Hotel was closed for repairs and enlargement and the scaffolding of the summer Casino at Juan les Pins grew larger and more formidable. Going into Cannes or Nice, Dick and Nicole met new people—members of orchestras, restaurateurs, horticultural enthusiasts, shipbuilders—for Dick had bought an old dinghy—and members of the Syndicat d’Initiative. They knew their servants well and gave thought to the children’s education. In December, Nicole seemed well-knit again; when a month had passed without tension, without the tight mouth, the unmotivated smile, the unfathomable remark, they went to the Swiss Alps for the Christmas holidays.
十一月，海浪变黑，冲过海堤，冲到岸边的路上——幸存下来的夏季生命消失了，海滩在密斯塔拉风和雨水的照射下显得忧郁而荒凉。高斯酒店因维修和扩建而关闭，胡安莱潘夏季赌场的脚手架变得更大、更强大。进入戛纳或尼斯，迪克和妮可结识了新朋友——管弦乐队成员、餐馆老板、园艺爱好者、造船商——因为迪克买了一艘旧小艇——以及倡议组织的成员。他们很了解仆人，也很关心孩子的教育。十二月，妮可看起来又恢复了良好的状态。当一个月过去了，没有紧张，没有紧闭的嘴巴，没有漫无目的的微笑，没有深不可测的话语，他们去瑞士阿尔卑斯山过圣诞假期。

XIII
十三

With his cap, Dick slapped the snow from his dark blue ski-suit before going inside. The great hall, its floor pockmarked by two decades of hobnails, was cleared for the tea dance, and four-score young Americans, domiciled in schools near Gstaad, bounced about to the frolic of ‘Don’t Bring Lulu,’ or exploded violently with the first percussions of the Charleston. It was a colony of the young, simple, and expensive—the Sturmtruppen of the rich were at St. Moritz. Baby Warren felt that she had made a gesture of renunciation in joining the Divers here.
迪克用帽子拍掉深蓝色滑雪服上的积雪，然后走进去。大厅的地板上布满了二十年的平头钉，被清理出来供茶舞会使用，住在格施塔德附近学校的四名美国年轻人在“别带露露”的嬉戏声中跳来跳去，或者猛烈地爆炸。随着查尔斯顿的第一声打击乐。这是一个年轻人的聚居地，简单而昂贵——富人的冲锋队就在圣莫里茨。沃伦宝宝觉得她加入戴弗斯这里就等于做出了放弃的姿态。

Dick picked out the two sisters easily across the delicately haunted, soft-swaying room—they were poster-like, formidable in their snow costumes, Nicole’s of cerulean blue, Baby’s of brick red. The young Englishman was talking to them; but they were paying no attention, lulled to the staring point by the adolescent dance.
迪克轻松地在这间闹鬼、摇曳的房间里认出了两姐妹——她们就像海报一样，穿着雪衣，令人敬畏，妮可的天蓝色，宝贝的砖红色。年轻的英国人正在跟他们说话。但他们并没有注意，被青春期的舞蹈所吸引，全神贯注。

Nicole’s snow-warm face lighted up further as she saw Dick. ‘Where is he?’
当妮可看到迪克时，她雪白温暖的脸变得更加明亮。 '他在哪里？'

‘He missed the train—I’m meeting him later.’ Dick sat down, swinging a heavy boot over his knee. ‘You two look very striking together. Every once in a while I forget we’re in the same party and get a big shock at seeing you.’
“他错过了火车——我稍后会见他。”迪克坐下来，把一只沉重的靴子放在膝盖上。 ‘你们两个在一起看起来非常引人注目。有时我会忘记我们是在同一个聚会，看到你时会感到非常震惊。”

Baby was a tall, fine-looking woman, deeply engaged in being almost thirty. Symptomatically she had pulled two men with her from London, one scarcely down from Cambridge, one old and hard with Victorian lecheries. Baby had certain spinsters’ characteristics— she was alien from touch, she started if she was touched suddenly, and such lingering touches as kisses and embraces slipped directly through the flesh into the forefront of her consciousness. She made few gestures with her trunk, her body proper—instead, she stamped her foot and tossed her head in almost an old-fashioned way. She relished the foretaste of death, prefigured by the catastrophes of friends—persistently she clung to the idea of Nicole’s tragic destiny.
贝比是个身材高挑、相貌俊美的女人，已经快三十岁了。她从伦敦拉来了两个男人，其中一个是从剑桥来的，另一个又老又硬，还有维多利亚时代的好色。贝比具有某些老处女的特征——她对触摸感到陌生，如果突然被触摸她就会惊慌，而诸如亲吻和拥抱之类挥之不去的触摸直接穿过肉体滑入她意识的最前沿。她几乎没有用躯干和身体做任何手势——相反，她跺着脚，以一种几乎老式的方式摇头。她享受着朋友们的灾难所预示的死亡的预尝——她始终坚信妮可的悲惨命运。

Baby’s younger Englishman had been chaperoning the women down appropriate inclines and harrowing them on the bob-run. Dick, having turned an ankle in a too ambitious telemark, loafed gratefully about the ‘nursery slope’ with the children or drank kvass with a Russian doctor at the hotel.
贝比的年轻英国人一直陪伴着妇女们走下适当的斜坡，并在鲍勃跑步中折磨她们。迪克在一次过于雄心勃勃的电报中扭伤了脚踝，满怀感激地和孩子们一起在“托儿所斜坡”上闲逛，或者在旅馆里和一位俄罗斯医生一起喝格瓦斯。

‘Please be happy, Dick,’ Nicole urged him. ‘Why don’t you meet some of these ickle durls and dance with them in the afternoon?’
“请开心点，迪克，”妮可催促他。 “你为什么不认识一下这些小家伙，下午和他们一起跳舞呢？”

‘What would I say to them?’
“我要对他们说什么？”

Her low almost harsh voice rose a few notes, simulating a plaintive coquetry: ‘Say: ‘Ickle durl, oo is de pwettiest sing.’ What do you think you say?’
她低沉得近乎刺耳的声音提高了几个音调，模仿着一种哀怨的卖弄风情：“说：‘Ickle dul，oo is de pwettiest sing.’你觉得你会说什么？”

‘I don’t like ickle durls. They smell of castile soap and peppermint. When I dance with them, I feel as if I’m pushing a baby carriage.’
“我不喜欢镰刀。”它们有卡斯蒂利亚肥皂和薄荷的味道。当我和他们一起跳舞时，我感觉自己就像在推着婴儿车。”

It was a dangerous subject—he was careful, to the point of selfconsciousness, to stare far over the heads of young maidens.
这是一个危险的话题——他小心翼翼地盯着年轻少女的头顶，甚至到了不自在的程度。

‘There’s a lot of business,’ said Baby. ‘First place, there’s news from home—the property we used to call the station property. The railroads only bought the centre of it at first. Now they’ve bought the rest, and it belonged to Mother. It’s a question of investing the money.’
“生意很多，”宝贝说。 “首先，有来自家乡的消息——我们过去称之为车站的房产。铁路公司一开始只买了它的中心部分。现在他们已经买下了剩下的，它属于母亲了。这是一个投资钱的问题。

Pretending to be repelled by this gross turn in the conversation, the Englishman made for a girl on the floor. Following him for an instant with the uncertain eyes of an American girl in the grip of a life-long Anglophilia, Baby continued defiantly:
英国人假装对谈话中的这种粗俗转变感到厌恶，向地板上的一个女孩走去。贝比用一个终生亲英的美国女孩那种不确定的目光追随了他一会儿，挑衅地继续说道：

‘It’s a lot of money. It’s three hundred thousand apiece. I keep an eye on my own investments but Nicole doesn’t know anything about securities, and I don’t suppose you do either.’
‘这是很多钱。每人三十万。我关注自己的投资，但妮可对证券一无所知，我想你也不懂。

‘I’ve got to meet the train,’ Dick said evasively.
“我得去赶火车。”迪克闪烁其词地说。

Outside he inhaled damp snowflakes that he could no longer see against the darkening sky. Three children sledding past shouted a warning in some strange language; he heard them yell at the next bend and a little farther on he heard sleigh-bells coming up the hill in the dark. The holiday station glittered with expectancy, boys and girls waiting for new boys and girls, and by the time the train arrived, Dick had caught the rhythm, and pretended to Franz Gregorovius that he was clipping off a half-hour from an endless roll of pleasures. But Franz had some intensity of purpose at the moment that fought through any superimposition of mood on Dick’s part. ‘I may get up to Zurich for a day,’ Dick had written, ‘or you can manage to come to Lausanne.’ Franz had managed to come all the way to Gstaad.
外面，他吸入了潮湿的雪花，在昏暗的天空中他再也看不到雪花了。三个孩子乘雪橇经过，用某种奇怪的语言大声警告；他听到他们在下一个拐弯处大喊大叫，再往前走一点，他听到黑暗中雪橇的铃声传上山。假日车站充满了期待，男孩和女孩们等待着新的男孩和女孩，当火车到达时，迪克已经抓住了节奏，并假装对弗兰茨·格雷戈罗维斯说，他正在从无休止的滚动中缩短半个小时的时间。乐趣。但弗兰茨此刻有某种强烈的目标，可以克服迪克的任何情绪叠加。 “我可能会去苏黎世呆一天，”迪克写道，“或者你也可以设法来洛桑。”弗兰茨设法一路来到格施塔德。

He was forty. Upon his healthy maturity reposed a set of pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in a somewhat stuffy safety from which he could despise the broken rich whom he reeducated. His scientific heredity might have bequeathed him a wider world but he seemed to have deliberately chosen the standpoint of an humbler class, a choice typified by his selection of a wife. At the hotel Baby Warren made a quick examination of him, and failing to find any of the hall-marks she respected, the subtler virtues or courtesies by which the privileged classes recognized one another, treated him thereafter with her second manner. Nicole was always a little afraid of him. Dick liked him, as he liked his friends, without reservations.
他四十岁了。他在健康成熟的基础上表现出了一套愉快的官方礼仪，但他最自在的感觉是在一种有点闷热的安全感中，在这种安全感中，他可以鄙视他所再教育的那些破产的富人。他的科学遗传或许给他留下了更广阔的天地，但他似乎刻意选择了卑微阶级的立场，这一选择以他对妻子的选择为代表。在旅馆里，贝贝·沃伦对他进行了快速的检查，但没有找到任何她所尊重的标志，即特权阶层相互认可的微妙美德或礼貌，此后她以第二种方式对待他。妮可总是有点怕他。迪克毫无保留地喜欢他，就像喜欢他的朋友一样。

For the evening they were sliding down the hill into the village, on those little sleds which serve the same purpose as gondolas do in Venice. Their destination was a hotel with an old-fashioned Swiss tap-room, wooden and resounding, a room of clocks, kegs, steins, and antlers. Many parties at long tables blurred into one great party and ate fondue—a peculiarly indigestible form of Welsh rarebit, mitigated by hot spiced wine.
晚上，他们乘坐那些小雪橇从山上滑下来进入村庄，这些小雪橇的用途与威尼斯的贡多拉相同。他们的目的地是一家旅馆，里面有一间老式瑞士酒吧间，木制的，声音响亮，房间里摆满了钟表、小桶、啤酒杯和鹿角。许多聚会在长桌旁聚成一个盛大的聚会，吃火锅——一种特别难消化的威尔士干酪，配以热香料葡萄酒。

It was jolly in the big room; the younger Englishman remarked it and Dick conceded that there was no other word. With the pert heady wine he relaxed and pretended that the world was all put together again by the gray-haired men of the golden nineties who shouted old glees at the piano, by the young voices and the bright costumes toned into the room by the swirling smoke. For a moment he felt that they were in a ship with landfall just ahead; in the faces of all the girls was the same innocent expectation of the possibilities inherent in the situation and the night. He looked to see if that special girl was there and got an impression that she was at the table behind them—then he forgot her and invented a rigmarole and tried to make his party have a good time.
大房间里一片欢乐。年轻的英国人说了这句话，迪克承认没有别的词了。喝着令人陶醉的酒，他放松下来，假装世界又被那些在钢琴上高声欢呼的上世纪九十年代的白发老人、年轻的声音和明亮的服装重新组合在一起了。抽烟。有那么一刻，他感觉他们是在一艘即将登陆的船上。所有女孩的脸上都流露出同样天真的期待，期待着这种情况和夜晚所固有的可能性。他看了看那个特别的女孩是否在那儿，并得到一个印象，她坐在他们后面的桌子上——然后他忘记了她，并发明了一种胡言乱语，试图让他的聚会玩得很开心。

‘I must talk to you,’ said Franz in English. ‘I have only twentyfour hours to spend here.’
“我必须和你谈谈，”弗朗茨用英语说。 “我只有二十四小时可以在这里度过。”

‘I suspected you had something on your mind.’
“我怀疑你有什么心事。”

‘I have a plan that is—so marvellous.’ His hand fell upon Dick’s knee. ‘I have a plan that will be the making of us two.’
“我有一个计划——太棒了。”他的手落在迪克的膝盖上。 “我有一个计划，它将帮助我们两个人。”

‘Well?’
'出色地？'

‘Dick—there is a clinic we could have together—the old clinic of Braun on the Zugersee. The plant is all modern except for a few points. He is sick—he wants to go up in Austria, to die probably. It is a chance that is just insuperable. You and me—what a pair! Now don’t say anything yet until I finish.’
“迪克——我们可以一起开一家诊所——祖格湖上布劳恩的老诊所。除了少数地方外，该工厂都很现代化。他病了——他想去奥地利，可能会死。这是一个无法克服的机会。你和我——真是一对啊！现在在我说完之前什么也别说。”

From the yellow glint in Baby’s eyes, Dick saw she was listening.
从宝贝眼中闪烁的黄色光芒，迪克看出她在听。

‘We must undertake it together. It would not bind you too tight— it would give you a base, a laboratory, a centre. You could stay in residence say no more than half the year, when the weather is fine. In winter you could go to France or America and write your texts fresh from clinical experience.’ He lowered his voice. ‘And for the convalescence in your family, there are the atmosphere and regularity of the clinic at hand.’ Dick’s expression did not encourage this note so Franz dropped it with the punctuation of his tongue leaving his lip quickly. ‘We could be partners. I the executive manager, you the theoretician, the brilliant consultant and all that. I know myself—I know I have no genius and you have. But, in my way, I am thought very capable; I am utterly competent at the most modern clinical methods. Sometimes for months I have served as the practical head of the old clinic. The professor says this plan is excellent, he advises me to go ahead. He says he is going to live forever, and work up to the last minute.’
‘我们必须共同承担这件事。它不会把你束缚得太紧——它会给你一个基地、一个实验室、一个中心。如果天气好的话，你可以在家里呆不超过半年。冬天你可以去法国或美国，根据临床经验写下你的文字。”他压低了声音。 “为了你家人的康复，还有诊所的气氛和规律。”迪克的表情并没有鼓励这句话，所以弗兰兹随着舌头的标点符号迅速离开嘴唇而把它扔掉了。 “我们可以成为合作伙伴。我是执行经理，你是理论家，出色的顾问等等。我了解我自己——我知道我没有天才，而你有。但是，以我的方式，我被认为非常有能力；我完全能够胜任最现代的临床方法。有时，我连续几个月担任老诊所的实际负责人。教授说这个计划非常好，他建议我继续。他说他会永远活下去，并且会工作到最后一刻。”

Dick formed imaginary pictures of the prospect as a preliminary to any exercise of judgment.
迪克对前景进行了想象，作为任何判断的第一步。

‘What’s the financial angle?’ he asked.
“财务角度是什么？”他问道。

Franz threw up his chin, his eyebrows, the transient wrinkles of his forehead, his hands, his elbows, his shoulders; he strained up the muscles of his legs, so that the cloth of his trousers bulged, pushed up his heart into his throat and his voice into the roof of his mouth.
弗朗兹扬起下巴、眉毛、前额、双手、肘部、肩膀上短暂的皱纹；他绷紧了双腿的肌肉，裤子的布料鼓了起来，把他的心推到了喉咙里，把他的声音推到了上颚。

‘There we have it! Money!’ he bewailed. ‘I have little money. The price in American money is two hundred thousand dollars. The innovation—ary—‘ he tasted the coinage doubtfully, ‘—steps, that you will agree are necessary, will cost twenty thousand dollars American. But the clinic is a gold mine—I tell you, I haven’t seen the books. For an investment of two hundred and twenty thousand dollars we have an assured income of—‘
‘我们有了！钱！”他哀叹道。 ‘我钱很少。以美元计算的价格是二十万美元。创新——ary——”他怀疑地品尝了这个货币，“——你会同意是必要的步骤，将花费两万美元美国。但诊所是一座金矿——我告诉你，我还没看过书。对于二十二万美元的投资，我们有保证的收入是——”

Baby’s curiosity was such that Dick brought her into the conversation.
贝比的好奇心让迪克把她带入谈话中。

‘In your experience, Baby,’ he demanded, ‘have you found that when a European wants to see an American VERY pressingly it is invariably something concerned with money?’
“根据你的经验，宝贝，”他问道，“你有没有发现，当一个欧洲人非常迫切地想见美国人时，总是与金钱有关？”

‘What is it?’ she said innocently.
“这是什么？”她天真地说。

‘This young Privat-dozent thinks that he and I ought to launch into big business and try to attract nervous breakdowns from America.’
“这位年轻的私人讲师认为他和我应该开展大生意，并试图吸引来自美国的精神崩溃。”

Worried, Franz stared at Baby as Dick continued:
弗兰兹担心地盯着宝贝，迪克继续说道：

‘But who are we, Franz? You bear a big name and I’ve written two textbooks. Is that enough to attract anybody? And I haven’t got that much money—I haven’t got a tenth of it.’ Franz smiled cynically. ‘Honestly I haven’t. Nicole and Baby are rich as Croesus but I haven’t managed to get my hands on any of it yet.’
“但是我们是谁，弗朗兹？你的名字很大，我写了两本教科书。这足以吸引任何人吗？而我没有那么多钱——连十分之一都没有。”弗兰兹愤世嫉俗地笑道。 ‘老实说我没有。妮可和宝贝像克罗伊索斯一样富有，但我还没有得到任何东西。

They were all listening now—Dick wondered if the girl at the table behind was listening too. The idea attracted him. He decided to let Baby speak for him, as one often lets women raise their voices over issues that are not in their hands. Baby became suddenly her grandfather, cool and experimental.
现在他们都在听——迪克想知道后面那桌的女孩是否也在听。这个想法吸引了他。他决定让贝比为他说话，因为人们经常让女性就自己无法掌控的问题发出自己的声音。贝比突然变成了她的祖父，冷静而富有实验性。

‘I think it’s a suggestion you ought to consider, Dick. I don’t know what Doctor Gregory was saying—but it seems to me—‘
“我认为这是你应该考虑的建议，迪克。我不知道格雷戈里医生在说什么——但在我看来——”

Behind him the girl had leaned forward into a smoke ring and was picking up something from the floor. Nicole’s face, fitted into his own across the table—her beauty, tentatively nesting and posing, flowed into his love, ever braced to protect it.
在他身后，女孩向前倾身进入烟圈，正在从地板上捡起什么东西。妮可的脸，与桌子对面他的脸融为一体——她的美丽，试探性地依偎着，摆着姿势，流入他的爱中，永远准备着保护它。

‘Consider it, Dick,’ Franz urged excitedly. ‘When one writes on psychiatry, one should have actual clinical contacts. Jung writes, Bleuler writes, Freud writes, Forel writes, Adler writes—also they are in constant contact with mental disorder.’
“考虑一下，迪克，”弗朗兹兴奋地催促道。 “当一个人写精神病学时，应该有实际的临床接触。荣格写作，布洛伊勒写作，弗洛伊德写作，福雷尔写作，阿德勒写作——而且他们也经常与精神障碍接触。

‘Dick has me,’ laughed Nicole. ‘I should think that’d be enough mental disorder for one man.’
“迪克有我，”妮可笑道。 “我认为这对于一个人来说已经足够精神障碍了。”

‘That’s different,’ said Franz cautiously.
“那是不同的，”弗兰茨小心翼翼地说。

Baby was thinking that if Nicole lived beside a clinic she would always feel quite safe about her.
贝比在想，如果妮可住在诊所旁边，她总会对她感到很安全。

‘We must think it over carefully,’ she said.
“我们必须仔细考虑一下，”她说。

Though amused at her insolence, Dick did not encourage it.
迪克虽然对她的无礼感到好笑，但并不鼓励她这样做。

‘The decision concerns me, Baby,’ he said gently. ‘It’s nice of you to want to buy me a clinic.’
“这个决定与我有关，宝贝，”他温和地说。 “你想给我买一家诊所，真是太好了。”

Realizing she had meddled, Baby withdrew hurriedly:
意识到自己多管闲事，Baby连忙退了出去：

‘Of course, it’s entirely your affair.’
“当然，这完全是你的事。”

‘A thing as important as this will take weeks to decide. I wonder how I like the picture of Nicole and me anchored to Zurich—‘ He turned to Franz, anticipating: ‘—I know. Zurich has a gashouse and running water and electric light—I lived there three years.’
“像这样重要的事情需要几周的时间才能做出决定。我不知道我是否喜欢妮可和我在苏黎世的照片——”他转向弗兰兹，期待着：“——我知道。苏黎世有一家煤气房、自来水和电灯——我在那里住了三年。”

‘I will leave you to think it over,’ said Franz. ‘I am confident—‘
“我会让你考虑一下，”弗朗茨说。 '我有信心-'

One hundred pair of five-pound boots had begun to clump toward the door, and they joined the press. Outside in the crisp moonlight, Dick saw the girl tying her sled to one of the sleighs ahead. They piled into their own sleigh and at the crisp-cracking whips the horses strained, breasting the dark air. Past them figures ran and scrambled, the younger ones shoving each other from sleds and runners, landing in the soft snow, then panting after the horses to drop exhausted on a sled or wail that they were abandoned. On either side the fields were beneficently tranquil; the space through which the cavalcade moved was high and limitless. In the country there was less noise as though they were all listening atavistically for wolves in the wide snow.
一百双五磅重的靴子已经开始向门口聚集，加入了媒体的行列。在外面清脆的月光下，迪克看到女孩把她的雪橇绑在前面的一辆雪橇上。他们挤进自己的雪橇，马鞭发出清脆的噼啪声，马匹在黑暗的空气中奋力前行。一些人奔跑着、攀爬着从他们身边经过，年轻的孩子们从雪橇和赛跑者身上互相推搡，落在柔软的雪地上，然后气喘吁吁地跟在马匹后面，精疲力尽地倒在雪橇上，或者哀号着他们被遗弃了。两边的田野非常宁静。队伍行进的空间很高，无边无际。乡间的噪音较少，仿佛他们都在大雪中探听狼群的踪迹。

In Saanen, they poured into the municipal dance, crowded with cow herders, hotel servants, shop-keepers, ski teachers, guides, tourists, peasants. To come into the warm enclosed place after the pantheistic animal feeling without, was to reassume some absurd and impressive knightly name, as thunderous as spurred boots in war, as football cleats on the cement of a locker-room floor. There was conventional yodelling, and the familiar rhythm of it separated Dick from what he had first found romantic in the scene. At first he thought it was because he had hounded the girl out of his consciousness; then it came to him under the form of what Baby had said: ‘We must think it over carefully—‘ and the unsaid lines back of that: ‘We own you, and you’ll admit it sooner or later. It is absurd to keep up the pretense of independence.’
在萨嫩，他们涌入市政舞会，挤满了牧牛人、酒店服务员、店主、滑雪老师、导游、游客和农民。在经历了泛神论动物的感觉之后，进入温暖的封闭空间，就是重新承担一些荒谬而令人印象深刻的骑士名字，就像战争中的带刺靴子一样雷鸣般，就像更衣室水泥地板上的足球鞋一样雷鸣。有传统的约德尔歌，熟悉的节奏使迪克与他最初在场景中发现的浪漫分开。起初他以为这是因为他把那个女孩从他的意识中赶了出来；后来他才意识到。然后他想到了贝比所说的话：“我们必须仔细考虑一下——”以及后面那句未说出口的台词：“我们拥有你，你迟早会承认这一点。”继续假装独立是荒谬的。”

It had been years since Dick had bottled up malice against a creature—since freshman year at New Haven when he had come upon a popular essay about ‘mental hygiene.’ Now he lost his temper at Baby and simultaneously tried to coop it up within him, resenting her cold rich insolence. It would be hundreds of years before any emergent Amazons would ever grasp the fact that a man is vulnerable only in his pride, but delicate as Humpty-Dumpty once that is meddled with—though some of them paid the fact a cautious lipservice. Doctor Diver’s profession of sorting the broken shells of another sort of egg had given him a dread of breakage. But:
迪克已经很多年没有对某种生物压抑过恶意了——自从在纽黑文读一年级时，他读到了一篇关于“心理卫生”的热门文章。现在，他对宝贝发脾气，同时又试图把它藏在心里。 ，怨恨她冷酷无礼的傲慢。任何新兴的亚马逊人都需要数百年的时间才能认识到这样一个事实：一个人仅在他的骄傲方面是脆弱的，但一旦受到干涉，就会像矮胖子一样脆弱——尽管他们中的一些人在口头上谨慎地表达了这一事实。戴弗医生的职业是分类另一种鸡蛋的破损蛋壳，这让他害怕鸡蛋破损。但：

‘There’s too much good manners,’ he said on the way back to Gstaad in the smooth sleigh.
“礼貌太多了，”他在乘坐平稳的雪橇返回格施塔德的路上说道。

‘Well, I think that’s nice,’ said Baby.
“嗯，我觉得这很好，”宝贝说。

‘No, it isn’t,’ he insisted to the anonymous bundle of fur. ‘Good manners are an admission that everybody is so tender that they have to be handled with gloves. Now, human respect—you don’t call a man a coward or a liar lightly, but if you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can’t distinguish what SHOULD be respected in them.’
“不，不是的，”他对着那堆不知名的毛皮坚持说。 “良好的举止意味着承认每个人都非常温柔，以至于必须戴着手套来对待他们。现在，人类的尊重——你不会轻易地称一个人为胆小鬼或骗子，但如果你一生都在照顾别人的感情并满足他们的虚荣心，你就会变得无法区分他们身上什么应该受到尊重。

‘I think Americans take their manners rather seriously,’ said the elder Englishman.
“我认为美国人相当重视他们的礼仪，”那位年长的英国人说。

‘I guess so,’ said Dick. ‘My father had the kind of manners he inherited from the days when you shot first and apologized afterward. Men armed—why, you Europeans haven’t carried arms in civil life since the beginning of the eighteenth century—‘
“我想是的，”迪克说。 “我父亲的礼貌是从你先开枪然后道歉的时代继承下来的。武装起来的人——为什么，你们欧洲人自十八世纪初以来就没有在公民生活中携带武器——”

‘Not actually, perhaps—‘
“实际上并非如此，或许——”

‘Not ACT-ually. Not really.’
'实际上不。并不真地。'

‘Dick, you’ve always had such beautiful manners,’ said Baby conciliatingly.
“迪克，你的举止总是那么漂亮。”贝比安抚地说。

The women were regarding him across the zoo of robes with some alarm. The younger Englishman did not understand—he was one of the kind who were always jumping around cornices and balconies, as if they thought they were in the rigging of a ship—and filled the ride to the hotel with a preposterous story about a boxing match with his best friend in which they loved and bruised each other for an hour, always with great reserve. Dick became facetious.
女人们在长袍的动物园里看着他，有些惊慌。年轻的英国人不明白——他是那种总是在飞檐和阳台上跳来跳去的人，好像他们以为自己在一艘船的索具上——并在去酒店的路上讲了一个关于拳击比赛的荒谬故事。和他最好的朋友在一起，他们互相爱着，互相伤害了一个小时，但总是非常谨慎。迪克变得很滑稽。

‘So every time he hit you you considered him an even better friend?’
“所以每次他打你的时候，你都认为他是一个更好的朋友？”

‘I respected him more.’
“我更尊重他了。”

‘It’s the premise I don’t understand. You and your best friend scrap about a trivial matter—‘
‘这是我不明白的前提。你和你最好的朋友因为一件小事而争吵——”

‘If you don’t understand, I can’t explain it to you,’ said the young Englishman coldly.
“如果你不明白，我无法向你解释。”年轻的英国人冷冷地说。

—This is what I’ll get if I begin saying what I think, Dick said to himself.
——如果我开始说出我的想法，这就是我会得到的结果，迪克对自己说。

He was ashamed at baiting the man, realizing that the absurdity of the story rested in the immaturity of the attitude combined with the sophisticated method of its narration.
他对引诱这个人感到羞愧，他意识到这个故事的荒谬之处在于态度的不成熟和叙述方法的复杂性。

The carnival spirit was strong and they went with the crowd into the grill, where a Tunisian barman manipulated the illumination in a counterpoint, whose other melody was the moon off the ice rink staring in the big windows. In that light, Dick found the girl devitalized, and uninteresting—he turned from her to enjoy the darkness, the cigarette points going green and silver when the lights shone red, the band of white that fell across the dancers as the door to the bar was opened and closed.
狂欢气氛很浓，他们随着人群走进烧烤店，突尼斯酒保以对位方式控制灯光，他的另一个旋律是溜冰场上的月亮在大窗户里凝视。在这种光线下，迪克发现这个女孩失去了活力，而且毫无趣味——他转过身去享受黑暗，当灯光闪烁红光时，烟头变成绿色和银色，白色的带子落在舞者身上，就像酒吧的门一样被打开和关闭。

‘Now tell me, Franz,’ he demanded, ‘do you think after sitting up all night drinking beer, you can go back and convince your patients that you have any character? Don’t you think they’ll see you’re a gastropath?’
“现在告诉我，弗朗茨，”他要求道，“你认为在喝了整晚啤酒之后，你可以回去让你的病人相信你有性格吗？你不认为他们会发现你是胃病患者吗？

‘I’m going to bed,’ Nicole announced. Dick accompanied her to the door of the elevator.
“我要睡觉了，”妮可宣布。迪克陪她走到电梯门口。

‘I’d come with you but I must show Franz that I’m not intended for a clinician.’
“我愿意和你一起去，但我必须向弗兰兹表明，我不适合当临床医生。”

Nicole walked into the elevator.
妮可走进电梯。

‘Baby has lots of common sense,’ she said meditatively.
“宝贝有很多常识。”她若有所思地说。

‘Baby is one of—‘
“宝贝是其中之一——”

The door slashed shut—facing a mechanical hum, Dick finished the sentence in his mind, ‘—Baby is a trivial, selfish woman.’
门猛地关上，面对着机械的嗡嗡声，迪克在脑海中完成了这句话：“——宝贝是个琐碎自私的女人。”

But two days later, sleighing to the station with Franz, Dick admitted that he thought favorably upon the matter.
但两天后，迪克和弗兰茨一起乘雪橇前往车站，他承认他对此事持积极态度。

‘We’re beginning to turn in a circle,’ he admitted. ‘Living on this scale, there’s an unavoidable series of strains, and Nicole doesn’t survive them. The pastoral quality down on the summer Riviera is all changing anyhow—next year they’ll have a Season.’
“我们正开始原地踏步，”他承认道。 “生活在这样的规模下，不可避免地会遇到一系列的压力，而妮可却无法幸免。”无论如何，夏季里维埃拉的田园风光正在发生变化——明年他们将迎来一个季节。

They passed the crisp green rinks where Wiener waltzes blared and the colors of many mountain schools flashed against the pale-blue skies.
他们经过清新的绿色溜冰场，那里响起了维也纳华尔兹的声音，许多山地学校的色彩在淡蓝色的天空下闪烁。

‘—I hope we’ll be able to do it, Franz. There’s nobody I’d rather try it with than you—‘
“——我希望我们能够做到，弗兰兹。没有人比你更愿意和我一起尝试——”

Good-by, Gstaad! Good-by, fresh faces, cold sweet flowers, flakes in the darkness. Good-by, Gstaad, good-by!
再见，格施塔德！再见，新鲜的面孔，冰冷甜美的花朵，黑暗中的雪花。再见，格施塔德，再见！

XIV
十四

Dick awoke at five after a long dream of war, walked to the window and stared out it at the Zugersee. His dream had begun in sombre majesty; navy blue uniforms crossed a dark plaza behind bands playing the second movement of Prokofieff’s ‘Love of Three Oranges.’ Presently there were fire engines, symbols of disaster, and a ghastly uprising of the mutilated in a dressing station. He turned on his bed-lamp light and made a thorough note of it ending with the half-ironic phrase: ‘Non-combatant’s shell-shock.’
迪克在经历了一场漫长的战争梦后，五点钟醒来，走到窗前，凝视着窗外的祖格湖。他的梦想是在阴沉的威严中开始的。深蓝色制服穿过黑暗的广场，乐队后面正在演奏普罗科菲耶夫的《三个橘子之恋》的第二乐章。不久，消防车出现了，这是灾难的象征，在更衣站里，残害者的可怕起义。他打开床头灯，彻底记下这一切，并以半讽刺的短语结尾：“非战斗人员的炮弹休克症。”

As he sat on the side of his bed, he felt the room, the house and the night as empty. In the next room Nicole muttered something desolate and he felt sorry for whatever loneliness she was feeling in her sleep. For him time stood still and then every few years accelerated in a rush, like the quick re-wind of a film, but for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty.
当他坐在床边时，他感觉房间、房子和夜晚都是空虚的。妮可在隔壁房间里嘟囔着一些凄凉的话，他为她在睡梦中感受到的孤独感感到难过。对他来说，时间是静止的，然后每隔几年就匆匆加速，就像电影的快速倒带一样，但对妮可来说，岁月随着时钟、日历和生日而流逝，伴随着她易逝的美丽的辛酸。

Even this past year and a half on the Zugersee seemed wasted time for her, the seasons marked only by the workmen on the road turning pink in May, brown in July, black in September, white again in Spring. She had come out of her first illness alive with new hopes, expecting so much, yet deprived of any subsistence except Dick, bringing up children she could only pretend gently to love, guided orphans. The people she liked, rebels mostly, disturbed her and were bad for her—she sought in them the vitality that had made them independent or creative or rugged, sought in vain—for their secrets were buried deep in childhood struggles they had forgotten. They were more interested in Nicole’s exterior harmony and charm, the other face of her illness. She led a lonely life owning Dick who did not want to be owned.
即使过去的一年半在祖格湖上的时间对她来说似乎也是浪费的，季节的标志只是路上的工人在五月变成粉红色，七月变成棕色，九月变成黑色，春天又变成白色。她带着新的希望从第一次生病中恢复过来，期待如此之多，但除了迪克之外，她被剥夺了任何生计，抚养着她只能假装温柔地爱着的孩子们，引导着孤儿们。她喜欢的人，大多是反叛者，打扰了她，对她不利——她在他们身上寻找使他们独立、富有创造力或粗犷的活力，但徒劳无功——因为他们的秘密深深埋藏在他们已经忘记的童年斗争中。他们更感兴趣的是妮可外表的和谐和魅力，这是她疾病的另一面。她拥有不想被拥有的迪克，过着孤独的生活。

Many times he had tried unsuccessfully to let go his hold on her. They had many fine times together, fine talks between the loves of the white nights, but always when he turned away from her into himself he left her holding Nothing in her hands and staring at it, calling it many names, but knowing it was only the hope that he would come back soon.
他曾多次试图松开她的手，但都没有成功。他们在一起度过了许多美好的时光，在白夜的爱人之间进行了愉快的交谈，但总是当他转身离开她，回到自己身边时，他让她手里拿着什么都没有，盯着它，用许多名字称呼它，但知道这只是希望他能尽快回来。

He scrunched his pillow hard, lay down, and put the back of his neck against it as a Japanese does to slow the circulation, and slept again for a time. Later, while he shaved, Nicole awoke and marched around, giving abrupt, succinct orders to children and servants. Lanier came in to watch his father shave—living beside a psychiatric clinic he had developed an extraordinary confidence in and admiration for his father, together with an exaggerated indifference toward most other adults; the patients appeared to him either in their odd aspects, or else as devitalized, over-correct creatures without personality. He was a handsome, promising boy and Dick devoted much time to him, in the relationship of a sympathetic but exacting officer and respectful enlisted man.
他用力揉捏枕头，躺下，像日本人那样用颈背抵住枕头以减缓血液循环，然后又睡了一会儿。后来，当他刮胡子的时候，妮可醒了，大步走来走去，对孩子和仆人发出唐突而简洁的命令。拉尼尔进来看他父亲刮胡子——住在一家精神病诊所旁边，他对父亲产生了非凡的信心和钦佩，同时对大多数其他成年人表现出过分的冷漠；在他看来，这些病人要么表现得很奇怪，要么就是缺乏活力、过于正确、没有个性的生物。他是一个英俊、有前途的男孩，迪克在他身上投入了很多时间，与他的关系就像一个富有同情心但要求严格的军官和受人尊敬的士兵。

‘Why,’ Lanier asked, ‘do you always leave a little lather on the top of your hair when you shave?’
“为什么，”拉尼尔问道，“你刮胡子时总是在头发顶部留下一点泡沫吗？”

Cautiously Dick parted soapy lips: ‘I have never been able to find out. I’ve often wondered. I think it’s because I get the first finger soapy when I make the line of my side-burn, but how it gets up on top of my head I don’t know.’
迪克小心翼翼地张开肥皂般的嘴唇：“我一直没能找到答案。”我经常想知道。我想这是因为当我画鬓角的线条时，我的第一根手指沾上了肥皂，但我不知道它是如何爬到我的头顶上的。

‘I’m going to watch it all to-morrow.’
“明天我要看完这一切。”

‘That’s your only question before breakfast?’
“这是你早餐前唯一的问题吗？”

‘I don’t really call it a question.’
“我真的不认为这是一个问题。”

‘That’s one on you.’
“那是你身上的一个。”

Half an hour later Dick started up to the administration building. He was thirty-eight—still declining a beard he yet had a more medical aura about him than he had worn upon the Riviera. For eighteen months now he had lived at the clinic—certainly one of the best-appointed in Europe. Like Dohmler’s it was of the modern type—no longer a single dark and sinister building but a small, scattered, yet deceitfully integrated village—Dick and Nicole had added much in the domain of taste, so that the plant was a thing of beauty, visited by every psychologist passing through Zurich. With the addition of a caddy house it might very well have been a country club. The Eglantine and the Beeches, houses for those sunk into eternal darkness, were screened by little copses from the main building, camouflaged strong-points. Behind was a large truck farm, worked partly by the patients. The workshops for ergotherapy were three, placed under a single roof and there Doctor Diver began his morning’s inspection. The carpentry shop, full of sunlight, exuded the sweetness of sawdust, of a lost age of wood; always half a dozen men were there, hammering, planing, buzzing— silent men, who lifted solemn eyes from their work as he passed through. Himself a good carpenter, he discussed with them the efficiency of some tools for a moment in a quiet, personal, interested voice. Adjoining was the book-bindery, adapted to the most mobile of patients who were not always, however, those who had the greatest chance for recovery. The last chamber was devoted to beadwork, weaving and work in brass. The faces of the patients here wore the expression of one who had just sighed profoundly, dismissing something insoluble—but their sighs only marked the beginning of another ceaseless round of ratiocination, not in a line as with normal people but in the same circle. Round, round, and round. Around forever. But the bright colors of the stuffs they worked with gave strangers a momentary illusion that all was well, as in a kindergarten. These patients brightened as Doctor Diver came in. Most of them liked him better than they liked Doctor Gregorovius. Those who had once lived in the great world invariably liked him better. There were a few who thought he neglected them, or that he was not simple, or that he posed. Their responses were not dissimilar to those that Dick evoked in nonprofessional life, but here they were warped and distorted.
半小时后迪克出发前往行政大楼。他三十八岁了——胡须仍在脱落，但他的身上比在里维埃拉时更有医学气息。他在这家诊所住了十八个月了——这无疑是欧洲设备最好的诊所之一。就像多姆勒的那样，它是现代类型的——不再是一座黑暗而险恶的建筑，而是一个小而分散的、但具有欺骗性的综合村庄——迪克和妮可在品味领域添加了很多东西，因此这种植物是一种美丽的东西，每一位经过苏黎世的心理学家都拜访过。如果加上一个球童屋，它很可能是一个乡村俱乐部。 Eglantine 和 Beeches 是为那些陷入永恒黑暗的人建造的房屋，主楼周围有小灌木丛，它们是伪装的据点。后面是一个大型卡车农场，部分工作由病人负责。运动治疗工作室共有三个，位于一个屋顶下，戴弗医生就在那里开始了早上的检查。木工店里阳光明媚，散发着木屑的甜味，散发着古老木头的味道。总是有六六个人在那儿，敲击、刨削、嗡嗡作响——沉默的人，当他经过时，他们抬起严肃的目光从他们的工作上。他本身就是一位优秀的木匠，他用一种安静、个性化、感兴趣的声音与他们讨论了一些工具的效率。毗邻的是书籍装订厂，适合流动性最强的患者，但这些患者并不总是最有可能康复的患者。最后一个房间专门用于珠饰、编织和黄铜加工。 这里的病人脸上都带着一种深深叹息的表情，对一些无法解决的事情不屑一顾——但他们的叹息只是标志着又一轮无休止的推理的开始，不像正常人那样排在一条线上，而是在同一个圈子里。圆、圆、圆。永远围绕。但他们所使用的东西的鲜艳颜色给陌生人一种短暂的错觉，以为一切都很好，就像在幼儿园一样。当戴弗医生进来时，这些病人都高兴起来。他们中的大多数人喜欢他胜过喜欢格雷戈罗维斯医生。曾经生活在大千世界的人，无不更加喜欢他。有一些人认为他忽视了他们，或者认为他不简单，或者他装腔作势。他们的反应与迪克在非职业生活中引起的反应没有什么不同，但在这里他们被扭曲和扭曲了。

One Englishwoman spoke to him always about a subject which she considered her own.
一位英国女人总是和他谈论一个她认为属于自己的话题。

‘Have we got music to-night?’
“今晚有音乐吗？”

‘I don’t know,’ he answered. ‘I haven’t seen Doctor Ladislau. How did you enjoy the music that Mrs. Sachs and Mr. Longstreet gave us last night?’
“我不知道，”他回答道。 “我还没见过拉迪斯劳医生。你觉得昨晚萨克斯夫人和朗斯特里特先生给我们演奏的音乐怎么样？

‘It was so-so.’
“一般般。”

‘I thought it was fine—especially the Chopin.’
“我认为这很好——尤其是肖邦。”

‘I thought it was so-so.’
“我觉得一般般。”

‘When are you going to play for us yourself?’
“你什么时候要亲自为我们演奏？”

She shrugged her shoulders, as pleased at this question as she had been for several years.
她耸耸肩，对这个问题感到高​​兴，就像多年来她一直感到的那样。

‘Some time. But I only play so-so.’
‘有时间吧。但我只是打得马马虎虎。

They knew that she did not play at all—she had had two sisters who were brilliant musicians, but she had never been able to learn the notes when they had been young together.
他们知道她根本不会演奏——她有两个姐妹都是出色的音乐家，但当她们年轻的时候，她从来没能学会音符。

From the workshop Dick went to visit the Eglantine and the Beeches. Exteriorly these houses were as cheerful as the others; Nicole had designed the decoration and the furniture on a necessary base of concealed grills and bars and immovable furniture. She had worked with so much imagination—the inventive quality, which she lacked, being supplied by the problem itself—that no instructed visitor would have dreamed that the light, graceful filagree work at a window was a strong, unyielding end of a tether, that the pieces reflecting modern tubular tendencies were stancher than the massive creations of the Edwardians—even the flowers lay in iron fingers and every casual ornament and fixture was as necessary as a girder in a skyscraper. Her tireless eyes had made each room yield up its greatest usefulness. Complimented, she referred to herself brusquely as a master plumber.
迪克从工作室出发去参观了 Eglantine 和 Beeches。从外观上看，这些房子和其他房子一样令人愉快。妮可在隐蔽的烤架、酒吧和不可移动的家具的必要基础上设计了装饰和家具。她的工作充满了想象力——她所缺乏的创造性品质是由问题本身所提供的——没有一个受过训练的参观者会想到窗户上轻盈、优雅的金丝工艺品是一根坚固、不屈的绳索末端，反映现代管状倾向的作品比爱德华七世时代的大规模创作更坚固——甚至连花朵都放在铁手指上，每一个随意的装饰品和固定装置都像摩天大楼中的大梁一样必要。她孜孜不倦的目光让每个房间都发挥出了最大的用处。受到称赞后，她粗暴地称自己为水管工大师。

For those whose compasses were not depolarized there seemed many odd things in these houses. Doctor Diver was often amused in the Eglantine, the men’s building—here there was a strange little exhibitionist who thought that if he could walk unclothed and unmolested from the Êtoile to the Place de la Concorde he would solve many things—and, perhaps, Dick thought, he was quite right.
对于那些指南针没有去极化的人来说，这些房子里似乎有很多奇怪的东西。戴弗医生经常在埃格朗廷（Eglantine）男士大楼里逗乐——这里有一个奇怪的小暴露狂，他认为如果他能赤身裸体、不受骚扰地从埃托瓦勒走到协和广场，他就能解决很多问题——也许，迪克想想，他说得很对。

His most interesting case was in the main building. The patient was a woman of thirty who had been in the clinic six months; she was an American painter who had lived long in Paris. They had no very satisfactory history of her. A cousin had happened upon her all mad and gone and after an unsatisfactory interlude at one of the whoopee cures that fringed the city, dedicated largely to tourist victims of drug and drink, he had managed to get her to Switzerland. On her admittance she had been exceptionally pretty— now she was a living agonizing sore. All blood tests had failed to give a positive reaction and the trouble was unsatisfactorily catalogued as nervous eczema. For two months she had lain under it, as imprisoned as in the Iron Maiden. She was coherent, even brilliant, within the limits of her special hallucinations.
他最有趣的案例是在主楼。病人是一位三十岁的女性，已经在诊所呆了六个月了。她是一位长期居住在巴黎的美国画家。他们对她没有非常满意的历史记录。一位表弟碰巧遇见了她，她疯了，走了，在城市边缘的一个狂欢疗法中度过了一段不令人满意的插曲，该疗法主要针对吸毒和酗酒的游客受害者，他设法将她带到了瑞士。当她承认时，她曾经非常漂亮——现在她是一个活生生的痛苦的疮。所有血液检查均未呈阳性反应，该问题被归类为神经性湿疹，结果令人不满意。她在它下面躺了两个月，就像被囚禁在铁处女号里一样。在她特殊的幻觉范围内，她是条理清晰的，甚至是才华横溢的。

She was particularly his patient. During spells of overexcitement he was the only doctor who could ‘do anything with her.’ Several weeks ago, on one of many nights that she had passed in sleepless torture Franz had succeeded in hypnotizing her into a few hours of needed rest, but he had never again succeeded. Hypnosis was a tool that Dick had distrusted and seldom used, for he knew that he could not always summon up the mood in himself—he had once tried it on Nicole and she had scornfully laughed at him.
她尤其是他的病人。在她过度兴奋的时期，他是唯一一个可以“对她做任何事情”的医生。几周前，在她遭受不眠折磨的许多个夜晚之一，弗兰兹成功地催眠了她，让她得到了几个小时的必要休息，但他再也没有成功过。催眠是迪克不信任且很少使用的工具，因为他知道他并不总是能唤起自己的情绪——他曾经在妮可身上尝试过，但她轻蔑地嘲笑了他。

The woman in room twenty could not see him when he came in—the area about her eyes was too tightly swollen. She spoke in a strong, rich, deep, thrilling voice.
当他进来时，二十号房间的女人看不到他——她的眼睛周围肿得太紧了。她说话的声音有力、浑厚、低沉、令人兴奋。

‘How long will this last? Is it going to be forever?’
'这会持续多久？它会永远吗？

‘It’s not going to be very long now. Doctor Ladislau tells me there are whole areas cleared up.’
‘现在不会太久了。拉迪斯劳医生告诉我，整个区域都被清理干净了。”

‘If I knew what I had done to deserve this I could accept it with equanimity.’
“如果我知道我做了什么而要受到这样的惩罚，我就能坦然接受。”

‘It isn’t wise to be mystical about it—we recognize it as a nervous phenomenon. It’s related to the blush—when you were a girl, did you blush easily?’
“对此保持神秘感并不明智——我们认为这是一种神经现象。这和脸红有关——你小时候很容易脸红吗？

She lay with her face turned to the ceiling.
她躺着，脸转向天花板。

‘I have found nothing to blush for since I cut my wisdom teeth.’
“自从我拔了智齿之后，我就没有什么可脸红的了。”

‘Haven’t you committed your share of petty sins and mistakes?’
“你没有犯过一些小罪和小错误吗？”

‘I have nothing to reproach myself with.’
“我没有什么可责备自己的。”

‘You’re very fortunate.’
“你真幸运。”

The woman thought a moment; her voice came up through her bandaged face afflicted with subterranean melodies:
女人想了一会儿；她的声音从她缠着绷带的脸上传出，饱受地下旋律的折磨：

‘I’m sharing the fate of the women of my time who challenged men to battle.’
“我正在分享我那个时代向男性发起战斗挑战的女性的命运。”

‘To your vast surprise it was just like all battles,’ he answered, adopting her formal diction.
“令你大吃一惊的是，这就像所有的战斗一样，”他回答道，采用了她正式的措辞。

‘Just like all battles.’ She thought this over. ‘You pick a setup, or else win a Pyrrhic victory, or you’re wrecked and ruined— you’re a ghostly echo from a broken wall.’
“就像所有的战斗一样。”她想了想。 “你选择一个布局，否则就会赢得一场皮洛士般的胜利，或者你就会被毁掉——你就是断壁残壁中的幽灵般的回声。”

‘You are neither wrecked nor ruined,’ he told her. ‘Are you quite sure you’ve been in a real battle?’
“你既没有被毁坏，也没有被毁掉，”他告诉她。 “你确定你参加过真正的战斗吗？”

‘Look at me!’ she cried furiously.
“看着我！”她愤怒地喊道。

‘You’ve suffered, but many women suffered before they mistook themselves for men.’ It was becoming an argument and he retreated. ‘In any case you mustn’t confuse a single failure with a final defeat.’
“你受苦了，但很多女人在误以为自己是男人之前也受过苦。”这逐渐成为一场争论，他退缩了。 “无论如何，你不能将一次失败与最终失败混为一谈。”

She sneered. ‘Beautiful words,’ and the phrase transpiring up through the crust of pain humbled him.
她冷笑。 “美丽的话语”，这句话从痛苦的外壳中流露出来，让他感到谦卑。

‘We would like to go into the true reasons that brought you here—‘ he began but she interrupted.
“我们想探究一下你来到这里的真正原因——”他开始说道，但她打断了他。

‘I am here as a symbol of something. I thought perhaps you would know what it was.’
“我来这里是为了某种东西的象征。我想也许你会知道那是什么。

‘You are sick,’ he said mechanically.
“你病了。”他机械地说。

‘Then what was it I had almost found?’
“那我差点就找到了什么？”

‘A greater sickness.’
“一场更严重的疾病。”

‘That’s all?’
'就这样？'

‘That’s all.’ With disgust he heard himself lying, but here and now the vastness of the subject could only be compressed into a lie. ‘Outside of that there’s only confusion and chaos. I won’t lecture to you—we have too acute a realization of your physical suffering. But it’s only by meeting the problems of every day, no matter how trifling and boring they seem, that you can make things drop back into place again. After that—perhaps you’ll be able again to examine—‘
“仅此而已。”他厌恶地听到自己在撒谎，但此时此地，这个话题的浩瀚只能压缩成谎言。 “除此之外，只有混乱和混乱。我不会对你说教——我们对你身体上的痛苦了解得太清楚了。但只有解决每天的问题，无论它们看起来多么琐碎和无聊，你才能让事情恢复原状。之后——也许你可以再次检查——”

He had slowed up to avoid the inevitable end of his thought: ‘—the frontiers of consciousness.’ The frontiers that artists must explore were not for her, ever. She was fine-spun, inbred— eventually she might find rest in some quiet mysticism. Exploration was for those with a measure of peasant blood, those with big thighs and thick ankles who could take punishment as they took bread and salt, on every inch of flesh and spirit.
他放慢了脚步，以避免他的思想不可避免的终结：“——意识的边界。”艺术家必须探索的边界永远不适合她。她天资聪颖，近亲结婚——最终她可能会在某种安静的神秘主义中找到休息。探索是为那些有一定农民血统的人，那些大腿粗、脚踝粗的人准备的，他们可以在吃面包和盐时承受惩罚，在每一寸肉体和精神上。

—Not for you, he almost said. It’s too tough a game for you.
——不适合你，他几乎说道。这对你来说太难了。

Yet in the awful majesty of her pain he went out to her unreservedly, almost sexually. He wanted to gather her up in his arms, as he so often had Nicole, and cherish even her mistakes, so deeply were they part of her. The orange light through the drawn blind, the sarcophagus of her figure on the bed, the spot of face, the voice searching the vacuity of her illness and finding only remote abstractions.
然而，在她极度痛苦的情况下，他毫无保留地向她倾诉，几乎是性的。他想把她抱在怀里，就像他经常拥抱妮可一样，甚至珍惜她的错误，因为它们深深地成为了她的一部分。橙色的光透过拉着的百叶窗，她在床上的石棺，脸上的斑点，声音在寻找她疾病的空虚，但只找到遥远的抽象。

As he arose the tears fled lava-like into her bandages.
当他站起来时，眼泪像熔岩一样流进她的绷带里。

‘That is for something,’ she whispered. ‘Something must come out of it.’
“那是为了某事，”她低声说道。 “一定能从中得到一些东西。”

He stooped and kissed her forehead.
他弯下腰​​，吻了吻她的额头。

‘We must all try to be good,’ he said.
“我们都必须努力做好人，”他说。

Leaving her room he sent the nurse in to her. There were other patients to see: an American girl of fifteen who had been brought up on the basis that childhood was intended to be all fun—his visit was provoked by the fact that she had just hacked off all her hair with a nail scissors. There was nothing much to be done for her—a family history of neurosis and nothing stable in her past to build on. The father, normal and conscientious himself, had tried to protect a nervous brood from life’s troubles and had succeeded merely in preventing them from developing powers of adjustment to life’s inevitable surprises. There was little that Dick could say: ‘Helen, when you’re in doubt you must ask a nurse, you must learn to take advice. Promise me you will.’
离开她的房间，他把护士送到她身边。还有其他病人要看：一个十五岁的美国女孩，她从小就被认为童年就是充满乐趣的，而他的来访是因为她刚刚用指甲剪剪掉了所有的头发。她没有什么可以做的——她有神经症家族史，过去也没有什么稳定的基础。父亲本人是一个正常而认真的人，曾试图保护神经质的孩子们免受生活中的麻烦，但成功的只是阻止他们发展出适应生活中不可避免的意外的能力。迪克几乎无话可说：‘海伦，当你有疑问时，你必须询问护士，你必须学会​​听取建议。答应我你会的。

What was a promise with the head sick? He looked in upon a frail exile from the Caucasus buckled securely in a sort of hammock which in turn was submerged in a warm medical bath, and upon the three daughters of a Portuguese general who slid almost imperceptibly toward paresis. He went into the room next to them and told a collapsed psychiatrist that he was better, always better, and the man tried to read his face for conviction, since he hung on the real world only through such reassurance as he could find in the resonance, or lack of it, in Doctor Diver’s voice. After that Dick discharged a shiftless orderly and by then it was the lunch hour.
脑子有病的时候有什么承诺？他看到一位来自高加索地区的流放者身体虚弱，被安全地扣在吊床上，吊床又浸入温暖的医疗浴中，还看到一位葡萄牙将军的三个女儿几乎不知不觉地陷入了瘫痪。他走进他们旁边的房间，告诉一位昏倒的精神科医生，他好多了，总是好起来，那个人试图从他的脸上看出信念，因为他只能通过他在共鸣中找到的安慰来坚持现实世界。戴弗医生的声音里有“”，或者“没有”。之后，迪克遣散了一名懒惰的勤务兵，那时已经是午餐时间了。

XV

Meals with the patients were a chore he approached with apathy. The gathering, which of course did not include residents at the Eglantine or the Beeches, was conventional enough at first sight, but over it brooded always a heavy melancholy. Such doctors as were present kept up a conversation but most of the patients, as if exhausted by their morning’s endeavor, or depressed by the company, spoke little, and ate looking into their plates.
与病人一起吃饭是一件苦差事，他对此漠不关心。这次聚会，当然不包括埃格兰廷酒店或比奇酒店的居民，乍一看很平常，但其上空总是笼罩着一种沉重的忧郁。在场的医生们一直在交谈，但大多数病人似乎因为早上的努力而疲惫不堪，或者因为有人陪伴而感到沮丧，他们很少说话，只是看着自己的盘子吃饭。

Luncheon over, Dick returned to his villa. Nicole was in the salon wearing a strange expression.
午餐结束后，迪克回到了自己的别墅。妮可在沙龙里，表情很奇怪。

‘Read that,’ she said.
“读一下，”她说。

He opened the letter. It was from a woman recently discharged, though with skepticism on the part of the faculty. It accused him in no uncertain terms of having seduced her daughter, who had been at her mother’s side during the crucial stage of the illness. It presumed that Mrs. Diver would be glad to have this information and learn what her husband was ‘really like.’
他打开了信。这是一位最近出院的女性发出的，尽管教职员工对此表示怀疑。它毫不含糊地指控他引诱了她的女儿，而她的女儿在疾病的关键阶段一直陪伴在她母亲身边。据推测，戴弗夫人会很高兴获得这些信息并了解她的丈夫“真正喜欢什么”。

Dick read the letter again. Couched in clear and concise English he yet recognized it as the letter of a maniac. Upon a single occasion he had let the girl, a flirtatious little brunette, ride into Zurich with him, upon her request, and in the evening had brought her back to the clinic. In an idle, almost indulgent way, he kissed her. Later, she tried to carry the affair further, but he was not interested and subsequently, probably consequently, the girl had come to dislike him, and taken her mother away.
迪克又读了一遍这封信。虽然这封信是用清晰简洁的英语写成的，但他还是认出了这是一个疯子写的信。有一次，他应那个轻浮的黑发女孩的要求，让她和他一起骑车去苏黎世，并在晚上把她带回诊所。他以一种闲散的、近乎放纵的方式吻了她。后来，她试图进一步发展这件事，但他不感兴趣，随后，可能因此，女孩开始不喜欢他，并带走了她的母亲。

‘This letter is deranged,’ he said. ‘I had no relations of any kind with that girl. I didn’t even like her.’
“这封信很混乱，”他说。 “我和那个女孩没有任何关系。我什至不喜欢她。

‘Yes, I’ve tried thinking that,’ said Nicole.
“是的，我试过这么想，”妮可说。

‘Surely you don’t believe it?’
“你肯定不相信吗？”

‘I’ve been sitting here.’
“我一直坐在这里。”

He sank his voice to a reproachful note and sat beside her.
他压低声音，带着责备的语气，坐在她身边。

‘This is absurd. This is a letter from a mental patient.’
‘这太荒谬了。这是一封来自精神病人的信。

‘I was a mental patient.’
“我是一名精神病人。”

He stood up and spoke more authoritatively.
他站了起来，语气更加权威。

‘Suppose we don’t have any nonsense, Nicole. Go and round up the children and we’ll start.’
“假设我们没有任何废话，妮可。去把孩子们围起来，我们就开始。”

In the car, with Dick driving, they followed the little promontories of the lake, catching the burn of light and water in the windshield, tunnelling through cascades of evergreen. It was Dick’s car, a Renault so dwarfish that they all stuck out of it except the children, between whom Mademoiselle towered mastlike in the rear seat. They knew every kilometer of the road—where they would smell the pine needles and the black stove smoke. A high sun with a face traced on it beat fierce on the straw hats of the children.
在迪克驾驶的车里，他们沿着湖边的小海角行驶，在挡风玻璃上捕捉到光线和水的灼烧感，穿过瀑布般的常青树。那是迪克的车，一辆雷诺汽车，太小了，除了孩子们之外，他们都从车里伸出来，后座上的小姐像桅杆一样高耸在孩子们中间。他们熟悉道路的每一公里——在那里他们会闻到松针和黑炉子的烟味。一轮高高的太阳，画着一张脸，猛烈地照在孩子们的草帽上。

Nicole was silent; Dick was uneasy at her straight hard gaze. Often he felt lonely with her, and frequently she tired him with the short floods of personal revelations that she reserved exclusively for him, ‘I’m like this—I’m more like that,’ but this afternoon he would have been glad had she rattled on in staccato for a while and given him glimpses of her thoughts. The situation was always most threatening when she backed up into herself and closed the doors behind her.
妮可沉默了。迪克对她直视而严厉的目光感到不安。和她在一起时，他经常感到孤独，而且她常常会因为她专门为他保留的短暂的个人启示而让他感到厌倦，“我是这样的——我更像是那样，”但今天下午，他会很高兴她断断续续地说了一会儿，让他瞥见了她的想法。当她倒退并关上身后的门时，情况总是最危险的。

At Zug Mademoiselle got out and left them. The Divers approached the Agiri Fair through a menagerie of mammoth steamrollers that made way for them. Dick parked the car, and as Nicole looked at him without moving, he said: ‘Come on, darl.’ Her lips drew apart into a sudden awful smile, and his belly quailed, but as if he hadn’t seen it he repeated: ‘Come on. So the children can get out.’
到了楚格，小姐下了车，留下了他们。潜水员们穿过一大群巨大的压路机来到了阿吉里集市，这些压路机为他们让路。迪克停好车，当妮可一动不动地看着他时，他说：“来吧，亲爱的。”她的嘴唇突然张开，露出一个可怕的微笑，他的肚子颤抖着，但他好像没有看到一样，又重复了一遍。 ： '快点。这样孩子们就可以出去了。

‘Oh, I’ll come all right,’ she answered, tearing the words from some story spinning itself out inside her, too fast for him to grasp. ‘Don’t worry about that. I’ll come—‘
“哦，我会来的，没问题。”她回答道，嘴里扯着一些在她心里旋转的故事，速度太快了，他无法理解。 ‘别担心这个。我会来-'

‘Then come.’
'那就来吧。'

She turned from him as he walked beside her but the smile still flickered across her face, derisive and remote. Only when Lanier spoke to her several times did she manage to fix her attention upon an object, a Punch-and-Judy show, and to orient herself by anchoring to it.
当他走在她身边时，她转过身去，但她的脸上仍然闪烁着微笑，嘲讽而遥远。只有当拉尼尔与她交谈了几次后，她才设法将注意力集中在一个物体上，即一场潘趣与朱迪的表演，并通过锚定它来确定自己的方向。

Dick tried to think what to do. The dualism in his views of her— that of the husband, that of the psychiatrist—was increasingly paralyzing his faculties. In these six years she had several times carried him over the line with her, disarming him by exciting emotional pity or by a flow of wit, fantastic and disassociated, so that only after the episode did he realize with the consciousness of his own relaxation from tension, that she had succeeded in getting a point against his better judgment.
迪克试图思考该怎么做。他对她的看法中的二元论——丈夫的观点，精神科医生的观点——越来越使他的能力瘫痪。在这六年里，她好几次带着他越过了界限，通过令人兴奋的怜悯之情或通过一连串的机智、幻想和分离来解除他的戒备，所以只有在这件事发生之后，他才意识到自己放松了紧张，她成功地得到了与他更好的判断相反的观点。

A discussion with Topsy about the guignol—as to whether the Punch was the same Punch they had seen last year in Cannes—having been settled, the family walked along again between the booths under the open sky. The women’s bonnets, perching over velvet vests, the bright, spreading skirts of many cantons, seemed demure against the blue and orange paint of the wagons and displays. There was the sound of a whining, tinkling hootchy-kootchy show.
与托普西关于吉尼诺的讨论——关于这支潘趣酒是否是他们去年在戛纳看到的同一种潘趣酒——讨论完毕后，一家人又在露天的摊位之间行走。女士们的帽子盖在天鹅绒背心上，还有许多州的明亮、展开的裙子，在马车和展品的蓝色和橙色油漆的映衬下显得端庄。现场传来一阵呜呜、叮叮当当的表演声。

Nicole began to run very suddenly, so suddenly that for a moment Dick did not miss her. Far ahead he saw her yellow dress twisting through the crowd, an ochre stitch along the edge of reality and unreality, and started after her. Secretly she ran and secretly he followed. As the hot afternoon went shrill and terrible with her flight he had forgotten the children; then he wheeled and ran back to them, drawing them this way and that by their arms, his eyes jumping from booth to booth.
妮可突然开始奔跑，如此突然以至于迪克一时没有错过她。在前面很远的地方，他看到她的黄色裙子在人群中蜿蜒而行，一条赭色的线迹沿着现实与虚幻的边缘，开始追随她。她偷偷地跑，他偷偷地跟着。随着她的飞行，炎热的下午变得刺耳而可怕，他忘记了孩子们。然后他转身跑回他们身边，抓住他们的胳膊，把他们拉来拉去，眼睛在一个摊位上跳来跳去。

‘Madame,’ he cried to a young woman behind a white lottery wheel, ‘Est-ce que je peux laisser ces petits avec vous deux minutes? C’est très urgent—je vous donnerai dix francs.’
“女士，”他对白色彩票轮后面的一位年轻女子喊道，“Est-ce que je peux laisser ces petits avec vous deux 分钟吗？”这是非常紧急的——je vous donnerai dix francs。

‘Mais oui.’
“Mais oui。”

He headed the children into the booth. ‘Alors—restez avec cette gentille dame.’
他领着孩子们走进了摊位。 “Alors——restez avec cette gentille dame。”

‘Oui, Dick.’
“哎呀，迪克。”

He darted off again but he had lost her; he circled the merry-goround keeping up with it till he realized he was running beside it, staring always at the same horse. He elbowed through the crowd in the buvette; then remembering a predilection of Nicole’s he snatched up an edge of a fortuneteller’s tent and peered within. A droning voice greeted him: ‘La septième fille d’une septième fille née sur les rives du Nil—entrez, Monsieur—‘
他再次飞奔而去，但他已经失去了她。他绕着旋转木马转了一圈，跟上它，直到他意识到自己正在旁边跑，而且总是盯着同一匹马。他用胳膊肘挤过小酒馆里的人群。然后想起妮可的一个偏爱，他抓起算命师帐篷的边缘，朝里面看去。一个单调的声音向他打招呼：“La septième fille d’une septième fille née sur les rives du Nil——entrez，先生——”

Dropping the flap he ran along toward where the plaisance terminated at the lake and a small ferris wheel revolved slowly against the sky. There he found her.
他放下襟翼，朝湖边游乐园的尽头跑去，一个小摩天轮在天空中缓缓旋转。在那里他找到了她。

She was alone in what was momentarily the top boat of the wheel, and as it descended he saw that she was laughing hilariously; he slunk back in the crowd, a crowd which, at the wheel’s next revolution, spotted the intensity of Nicole’s hysteria.
她独自一人坐在摩天轮最上面的船上，当摩天轮下降时，他看到她正在哈哈大笑。他偷偷溜回人群中，在方向盘下一转时，人群发现了妮可歇斯底里的强度。

‘Regardez-moi ça!’
“再见，我！”

‘Regarde donc cette Anglaise!’
“向英国人致敬！”

Down she dropped again—this time the wheel and its music were slowing and a dozen people were around her car, all of them impelled by the quality of her laughter to smile in sympathetic idiocy. But when Nicole saw Dick her laughter died—she made a gesture of slipping by and away from him but he caught her arm and held it as they walked away.
她又倒下了——这一次，方向盘和音乐都变慢了，她的车周围围了十几个人，所有人都被她的笑声所驱使，露出同情的白痴微笑。但当妮可看到迪克时，她的笑声戛然而止——她做了一个从他身边溜走的手势，但他抓住了她的手臂，在他们走开时握住了它。

‘Why did you lose control of yourself like that?’
“你为什么这么失控？”

‘You know very well why.’
“你很清楚为什么。”

‘No, I don’t.’
“不，我不。”

‘That’s just preposterous—let me loose—that’s an insult to my intelligence. Don’t you think I saw that girl look at you—that little dark girl. Oh, this is farcical—a child, not more than fifteen. Don’t you think I saw?’
“这太荒谬了——让我放松——这是对我智力的侮辱。你不觉得我看到那个女孩看着你吗——那个黑皮肤的小女孩。哦，这真是滑稽——一个孩子，还不到十五岁。你以为我没看见吗？

‘Stop here a minute and quiet down.’
“在这里停一下，安静点。”

They sat at a table, her eyes in a profundity of suspicion, her hand moving across her line of sight as if it were obstructed. ‘I want a drink—I want a brandy.’
他们坐在一张桌子旁，她的眼神里充满了深深的怀疑，她的手在视线上移动，好像视线被遮挡了一样。 “我想要一杯饮料——我想要一杯白兰地。”

‘You can’t have brandy—you can have a bock if you want it.’
“你不能喝白兰地——如果你想要的话，你可以喝一杯博克。”

‘Why can’t I have a brandy?’
“为什么我不能喝白兰地？”

‘We won’t go into that. Listen to me—this business about a girl is a delusion, do you understand that word?’
‘我们不会讨论这个。听我说——关于女孩的事都是错觉，你明白这个词吗？

‘It’s always a delusion when I see what you don’t want me to see.’
“当我看到你不希望我看到的东西时，这总是一种错觉。”

He had a sense of guilt as in one of those nightmares where we are accused of a crime which we recognize as something undeniably experienced, but which upon waking we realize we have not committed. His eyes wavered from hers.
他有一种负罪感，就像在一场噩梦中，我们被指控犯有一项罪行，我们承认这是不可否认的经历，但醒来后我们意识到我们没有犯下这一罪行。他的目光从她的身上移开。

‘I left the children with a gypsy woman in a booth. We ought to get them.’
“我把孩子们留给了一个吉普赛女人在一个摊位里。我们应该得到它们。

‘Who do you think you are?’ she demanded. ‘Svengali?’
“你以为你是谁？”她问道。 “斯文加利？”

Fifteen minutes ago they had been a family. Now as she was crushed into a corner by his unwilling shoulder, he saw them all, child and man, as a perilous accident.
十五分钟前他们还是一家人。现在，当她被他不情愿的肩膀压到角落时，他把他们所有人，无论是孩子还是男人，都视为一场危险的事故。

‘We’re going home.’
“我们要回家了。”

‘Home!’ she roared in a voice so abandoned that its louder tones wavered and cracked. ‘And sit and think that we’re all rotting and the children’s ashes are rotting in every box I open? That filth!’
“回家！”她用一种被遗弃的声音吼道，声音变得颤抖和破裂。 ‘然后坐下来想想我们都在腐烂，孩子们的骨灰在我打开的每个盒子里都腐烂了？那个污秽！’

Almost with relief he saw that her words sterilized her, and Nicole, sensitized down to the corium of the skin, saw the withdrawal in his face. Her own face softened and she begged, ‘Help me, help me, Dick!’
他几乎松了口气，因为她的话语让她变得绝育，而妮可，敏感到皮肤的真皮层，看到了他脸上的退缩。她自己的脸色变得柔和起来，她恳求道：“救救我，救救我，迪克！”

A wave of agony went over him. It was awful that such a fine tower should not be erected, only suspended, suspended from him. Up to a point that was right: men were for that, beam and idea, girder and logarithm; but somehow Dick and Nicole had become one and equal, not opposite and complementary; she was Dick too, the drought in the marrow of his bones. He could not watch her disintegrations without participating in them. His intuition rilled out of him as tenderness and compassion—he could only take the characteristically modern course, to interpose—he would get a nurse from Zurich, to take her over to-night.
一阵痛苦袭上他的心头。可怕的是，如此精美的塔不应该被竖立起来，而只是悬挂着，悬挂在他身上。在某种程度上，这是正确的：男人就是这样做的，梁和想法，梁和对数；但不知何故，迪克和妮可已经成为一体，平等，而不是对立和互补。她也是迪克，是他骨髓里的干旱。他不能眼睁睁地看着她的崩溃而不参与其中。他的直觉从他身上涌出温柔和同情心——他只能采取典型的现代方式进行干预——他会从苏黎世找一名护士，今晚来接她。

‘You CAN help me.’
'你可以帮助我。'

Her sweet bullying pulled him forward off his feet. ‘You’ve helped me before—you can help me now.’
她甜蜜的欺凌把他拉得站不稳。 “你以前帮助过我——现在你可以帮助我了。”

‘I can only help you the same old way.’
“我只能以同样的方式帮助你。”

‘Some one can help me.’
“有人可以帮助我。”

‘Maybe so. You can help yourself most. Let’s find the children.’
'也许是这样。你最能帮助自己。我们去找孩子们吧。

There were numerous lottery booths with white wheels—Dick was startled when he inquired at the first and encountered blank disavowals. Evil-eyed, Nicole stood apart, denying the children, resenting them as part of a downright world she sought to make amorphous. Presently Dick found them, surrounded by women who were examining them with delight like fine goods, and by peasant children staring.
那里有很多带有白色轮子的彩票摊位——当迪克第一次询问并遭到空白否认时，他吃了一惊。妮可目光邪恶，站在一边，否认孩子们，憎恨他们，认为他们是她试图塑造的一个彻头彻尾的世界的一部分。不久迪克就找到了它们，周围都是妇女，她们像精美的商品一样高兴地审视着它们，农家孩子也盯着它们。

‘Merci, Monsieur, ah Monsieur est trop généreux. C’était un plaisir, M’sieur, Madame. Au revoir, mes petits.’
“谢谢，先生，啊先生，这是最伟大的。” C’était un plaisir，先生，女士。再见，我的小。

They started back with a hot sorrow streaming down upon them; the car was weighted with their mutual apprehension and anguish, and the children’s mouths were grave with disappointment. Grief presented itself in its terrible, dark unfamiliar color. Somewhere around Zug, Nicole, with a convulsive effort, reiterated a remark she had made before about a misty yellow house set back from the road that looked like a painting not yet dry, but it was just an attempt to catch at a rope that was playing out too swiftly.
他们往回走，一股强烈的悲伤袭上心头。车里充满了他们彼此的忧虑和痛苦，孩子们的嘴里满是失望。悲伤以其可怕的、黑暗的、陌生的颜色呈现出来。在楚格附近的某个地方，妮可用一种痉挛般的努力，重复了她之前说过的一句话，说的是一座雾蒙蒙的黄色房子，远离道路，看起来就像一幅尚未干燥的画，但这只是试图抓住一根绳子，那是一根绳子。玩得太快了。

Dick tried to rest—the struggle would come presently at home and he might have to sit a long time, restating the universe for her. A ‘schizophrêne’ is well named as a split personality—Nicole was alternately a person to whom nothing need be explained and one to whom nothing COULD be explained. It was necessary to treat her with active and affirmative insistence, keeping the road to reality always open, making the road to escape harder going. But the brilliance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through, over and around a dike. It requires the united front of many people to work against it. He felt it necessary that this time Nicole cure herself; he wanted to wait until she remembered the other times, and revolted from them. In a tired way, he planned that they would again resume the régime relaxed a year before.
迪克试图休息——家里很快就会有斗争，他可能要坐很长时间，为她重述宇宙。 “精神分裂症”被恰当地称为人格分裂——妮可要么是一个不需要向其解释任何事情的人，要么是一个无法向其解释任何事情的人。要用积极、肯定的坚持对待她，让通往现实的路永远畅通，让逃避的路更难走。但疯狂的辉煌和多才多艺就像水渗入堤坝、堤坝上方和周围的足智多谋。它需要很多人的统一战线来共同对抗。他觉得这一次妮可有必要治好自己的病。他想等到她记起其他的事，并厌恶它们。他疲惫地计划着他们将再次恢复一年前宽松的制度。

He had turned up a hill that made a short cut to the clinic, and now as he stepped on the accelerator for a short straightaway run parallel to the hillside the car swerved violently left, swerved right, tipped on two wheels and, as Dick, with Nicole’s voice screaming in his ear, crushed down the mad hand clutching the steering wheel, righted itself, swerved once more and shot off the road; it tore through low underbrush, tipped again and settled slowly at an angle of ninety degrees against a tree.
他翻上了一座小山，从那里抄近路到了诊所，现在，当他踩下油门，与山坡平行地进行短距离直跑时，汽车猛烈地向左转向，向右转向，两个轮子翻倒，正如迪克所说，妮可的声音在他耳边尖叫，压垮了抓着方向盘的疯狂手，恢复正常，再次转向，冲出了路面。它冲破低矮的灌木丛，再次倾斜，以九十度角缓慢地靠在一棵树上。

The children were screaming and Nicole was screaming and cursing and trying to tear at Dick’s face. Thinking first of the list of the car and unable to estimate it Dick bent away Nicole’s arm, climbed over the top side and lifted out the children; then he saw the car was in a stable position. Before doing anything else he stood there shaking and panting.
孩子们在尖叫，妮可又尖叫又咒骂，试图撕扯迪克的脸。迪克首先想到了汽车的清单，但无法估计它，于是他弯开妮可的手臂，爬到车顶，把孩子们抱了出来；然后他看到车子已经停稳了。在做其他事情之前，他站在那里颤抖着，气喘吁吁。

‘You—!’ he cried.
“你——！”他喊道。

She was laughing hilariously, unashamed, unafraid, unconcerned. No one coming on the scene would have imagined that she had caused it; she laughed as after some mild escape of childhood.
她笑得很开心，毫不羞耻，无所畏惧，毫不关心。任何来到现场的人都不会想到这是她造成的。她笑起来，仿佛刚刚逃离了童年。

‘You were scared, weren’t you?’ she accused him. ‘You wanted to live!’
“你很害怕，不是吗？”她指责他。 “你想活下去！”

She spoke with such force that in his shocked state Dick wondered if he had been frightened for himself—but the strained faces of the children, looking from parent to parent, made him want to grind her grinning mask into jelly.
她说话的力度如此之大，以至于迪克在震惊的状态下怀疑自己是否也被自己吓到了——但是孩子们紧张的表情，从父母到父母，让他想把她咧着嘴笑的面具磨成果冻。

Directly above them, half a kilometer by the winding road but only a hundred yards climbing, was an inn; one of its wings showed through the wooded hill.
在他们的正上方，沿着蜿蜒的道路半公里处，但只有一百码的爬坡距离，有一家旅馆。它的一只翅膀透过树木繁茂的山丘露出来。

‘Take Topsy’s hand,’ he said to Lanier, ‘like that, tight, and climb up that hill—see the little path? When you get to the inn tell them ‘La voiture Divare est cassée.’ Some one must come right down.’
“握住托普西的手，”他对拉尼尔说，“就这样，紧紧地爬上那座山——看到那条小路了吗？当你到达旅馆时，告诉他们“La voiture Divare est cassée”。必须有人马上下来。

Lanier, not sure what had happened, but suspecting the dark and unprecedented, asked:
拉尼尔不确定发生了什么事，但怀疑事情的黑暗和前所未有，问道：

‘What will you do, Dick?’
“你会怎么做，迪克？”

‘We’ll stay here with the car.’
“我们会开着车留在这里。”

Neither of them looked at their mother as they started off. ‘Be careful crossing the road up there! Look both ways!’ Dick shouted after them.
出发时，他们俩都没有看妈妈一眼。 ‘那边过马路要小心！向两边看！”迪克在他们身后喊道。

He and Nicole looked at each other directly, their eyes like blazing windows across a court of the same house. Then she took out a compact, looked in its mirror, and smoothed back the temple hair. Dick watched the children climbing for a moment until they disappeared among the pines half way up; then he walked around the car to see the damage and plan how to get it back on the road. In the dirt he could trace the rocking course they had pursued for over a hundred feet; he was filled with a violent disgust that was not like anger.
他和妮可直视对方，他们的眼睛就像同一栋房子的庭院里燃烧的窗户。然后她拿出一个粉盒，对着镜子，抚平太阳穴的头发。迪克看着孩子们爬了一会儿，直到他们消失在半山腰的松树中。然后他绕着汽车走一圈，查看损坏情况，并计划如何将其重新上路。在泥土中，他可以追踪他们已经行驶了一百多英尺的摇晃路线。他心中充满了一种不像愤怒的强烈厌恶。

In a few minutes the proprietor of the inn came running down.
没几分钟，客栈老板就跑下来了。

‘My God!’ he exclaimed. ‘How did it happen, were you going fast? What luck! Except for that tree you’d have rolled down hill!’
“天哪！”他惊呼道。 ‘怎么会这样，你跑得快吗？多么幸运啊！如果不是那棵树，你早就从山上滚下来了！”

Taking advantage of Emile’s reality, the wide black apron, the sweat upon the rolls of his face, Dick signalled to Nicole in a matter-of-fact way to let him help her from the car; whereupon she jumped over the lower side, lost her balance on the slope, fell to her knees and got up again. As she watched the men trying to move the car her expression became defiant. Welcoming even that mood Dick said:
迪克利用埃米尔的现实，宽大的黑围裙，脸上的汗水，以一种实事求是的方式向妮可示意，让他扶她下车；然后，妮可看到了迪克。于是她从下面跳了下去，在斜坡上失去平衡，跪倒在地，又站起来。当她看着那些试图移动汽车的人时，她的表情变得挑衅。迪克甚至对这种情绪表示欢迎，他说：

‘Go and wait with the children, Nicole.’
“妮可，去和孩子们一起等待吧。”

Only after she had gone did he remember that she had wanted cognac, and that there was cognac available up there—he told Emile never mind about the car; they would wait for the chauffeur and the big car to pull it up onto the road. Together they hurried up to the inn.
直到她走后，他才想起她想要干邑白兰地，而且那里有干邑白兰地——他告诉埃米尔别介意汽车；他告诉埃米尔，别介意汽车的事。他们会等待司机和大车把它拉到路上。两人一起急忙赶往客栈。

‘I want to go away,’ he told Franz. ‘For a month or so, for as long as I can.’
“我想离开，”他告诉弗朗兹。 “一个月左右，只要我能，就可以。”

‘Why not, Dick? That was our original arrangement—it was you who insisted on staying. If you and Nicole—‘
“为什么不呢，迪克？这是我们原本的安排，是你坚持留下来的。如果你和妮可——”

‘I don’t want to go away with Nicole. I want to go away alone. This last thing knocked me sideways—if I get two hours’ sleep in twenty-four, it’s one of Zwingli’s miracles.’
“我不想和妮可一起离开。我想一个人走开。最后一件事让我大吃一惊——如果我能在二十四小时内睡两个小时，那就是慈运理的奇迹之一。

‘You wish a real leave of abstinence.’
“你希望真正禁欲。”

‘The word is ‘absence.’ Look here: if I go to Berlin to the Psychiatric Congress could you manage to keep the peace? For three months she’s been all right and she likes her nurse. My God, you’re the only human being in this world I can ask this of.’
“这个词就是‘缺席’。看这里：如果我去柏林参加精神病学大会，你能设法维持和平吗？”三个月来她一切都很好，她喜欢她的护士。我的上帝，你是这个世界上我唯一能提出这样的要求的人。

Franz grunted, considering whether or not he could be trusted to think always of his partner’s interest.
弗兰茨咕哝着，考虑着是否可以相信他总是会考虑他伴侣的利益。

In Zurich the next week Dick drove to the airport and took the big plane for Munich. Soaring and roaring into the blue he felt numb, realizing how tired he was. A vast persuasive quiet stole over him, and he abandoned sickness to the sick, sound to the motors, direction to the pilot. He had no intention of attending so much as a single session of the congress—he could imagine it well enough, new pamphlets by Bleuler and the elder Forel that he could much better digest at home, the paper by the American who cured dementia præcox by pulling out his patient’s teeth or cauterizing their tonsils, the half-derisive respect with which this idea would be greeted, for no more reason than that America was such a rich and powerful country. The other delegates from America—red-headed Schwartz with his saint’s face and his infinite patience in straddling two worlds, as well as dozens of commercial alienists with hang-dog faces, who would be present partly to increase their standing, and hence their reach for the big plums of the criminal practice, partly to master novel sophistries that they could weave into their stock in trade, to the infinite confusion of all values. There would be cynical Latins, and some man of Freud’s from Vienna. Articulate among them would be the great Jung, bland, supervigorous, on his rounds between the forests of anthropology and the neuroses of school-boys. At first there would be an American cast to the congress, almost Rotarian in its forms and ceremonies, then the closer-knit European vitality would fight through, and finally the Americans would play their trump card, the announcement of colossal gifts and endowments, of great new plants and training schools, and in the presence of the figures the Europeans would blanch and walk timidly. But he would not be there to see.
下周迪克在苏黎世开车前往机场，乘坐大飞机飞往慕尼黑。翱翔在蔚蓝的天空中，他感到麻木，意识到自己有多累。一种巨大的、有说服力的安静悄然袭上他的心头，他把疾病留给了病人，把声音留给了发动机，把方向留给了飞行员。他根本不打算参加一次国会会议——他可以很好地想象，布洛伊勒和老福雷尔写的新小册子，他在家可以更好地消化，还有美国人治愈早发性痴呆的论文。拔掉病人的牙齿或烧灼他们的扁桃体，这种想法会受到半嘲笑的尊重，原因无非是美国是一个如此富裕和强大的国家。其他来自美国的代表——红头发的施瓦茨，有着圣人般的面孔，对跨越两个世界有着无限的耐心，还有数十名面容阴沉的商业精神病学家，他们出席的部分原因是为了提高自己的地位，从而扩大影响力对于犯罪实践中的大人物来说，部分是为了掌握新奇的诡辩，他们可以将其编织到他们的交易中，从而对所有价值观造成无限混乱。会有愤世嫉俗的拉丁人，以及一些来自维也纳的弗洛伊德之人。其中最能表达的就是伟大的荣格，他温和而充满活力，在人类学的森林和学生的神经症之间徘徊。首先会有美国人参加大会，其形式和仪式几乎是扶轮社的，然后更紧密的欧洲活力将发挥作用，最后美国人将打出他们的王牌，​​宣布巨额礼物和捐赠，伟大的新工厂和培训学校，在这些人物面前，欧洲人会脸色苍白，走路胆怯。 但他不会去那里看。

They skirted the Vorarlberg Alps, and Dick felt a pastoral delight in watching the villages. There were always four or five in sight, each one gathered around a church. It was simple looking at the earth from far off, simple as playing grim games with dolls and soldiers. This was the way statesmen and commanders and all retired people looked at things. Anyhow, it was a good draft of relief.
他们绕过福拉尔贝格阿尔卑斯山，迪克在观看这些村庄时感到一种田园般的快乐。视线中总是有四五个人，每个人都聚集在一座教堂周围。从远处看地球很简单，就像和洋娃娃和士兵玩残酷的游戏一样简单。这就是政治家、指挥官和所有退休人员看待事物的方式。不管怎样，这对我来说是一次很好的缓解。

An Englishman spoke to him from across the aisle but he found something antipathetic in the English lately. England was like a rich man after a disastrous orgy who makes up to the household by chatting with them individually, when it is obvious to them that he is only trying to get back his self-respect in order to usurp his former power.
一名英国人在过道对面与他交谈，但他最近发现英国人有些反感。英格兰就像一个富人在一场灾难性的狂欢之后，通过与家人单独聊天来弥补，而他们很明显，他只是想夺回自尊，以篡夺他以前的权力。

Dick had with him what magazines were available on the station quays: The Century, The Motion Picture, L’lllustration, and the Fliegende Blätter, but it was more fun to descend in his imagination into the villages and shake hands with the rural characters. He sat in the churches as he sat in his father’s church in Buffalo, amid the starchy must of Sunday clothes. He listened to the wisdom of the Near East, was Crucified, Died, and was Buried in the cheerful church, and once more worried between five or ten cents for the collection plate, because of the girl who sat in the pew behind.
迪克随身携带了车站码头上可以找到的杂志：《世纪》、《电影》、《插画》和《Fliegende Blätter》，但更有趣的是，在他的想象中深入村庄，与乡村人物握手。他坐在教堂里，就像坐在他父亲位于布法罗的教堂里一样，周围都是周日穿着的僵硬的衣服。他聆听了近东的智慧，被钉在十字架上，死了，被埋葬在欢乐的教堂里，并再次担心五美分或十美分的收集盘，因为坐在后面长凳上的女孩。

The Englishman suddenly borrowed his magazines with a little small change of conversation, and Dick, glad to see them go, thought of the voyage ahead of him. Wolf-like under his sheep’s clothing of long-staple Australian wool, he considered the world of pleasure— the incorruptible Mediterranean with sweet old dirt caked in the olive trees, the peasant girl near Savona with a face as green and rose as the color of an illuminated missal. He would take her in his hands and snatch her across the border ...
英国人突然借了他的杂志，谈话做了一点小小的改变，迪克很高兴看到他们离开，想到了他前面的航行。他像狼一样披着澳大利亚长绒羊毛的羊皮，思考着快乐的世界——纯洁的地中海，橄榄树上结满了甜蜜的陈旧污垢，萨沃纳附近的农家女孩，脸色像绿色和玫瑰色一样一本彩绘弥撒书他要把她捧在手里，带她跨过国境……

... but there he deserted her—he must press on toward the Isles of Greece, the cloudy waters of unfamiliar ports, the lost girl on shore, the moon of popular songs. A part of Dick’s mind was made up of the tawdry souvenirs of his boyhood. Yet in that somewhat littered Five-and-Ten, he had managed to keep alive the low painful fire of intelligence.
……但他在那里抛弃了她——他必须继续前往希腊诸岛、陌生港口的浑浊海水、岸上迷失的女孩、流行歌曲的月亮。迪克的一部分心思是由他童年时期的庸俗纪念品组成的。然而，在那个有点乱七八糟的五和十中，他成功地保持了低沉痛苦的智慧之火。

十七

Tommy Barban was a ruler, Tommy was a hero—Dick happened upon him in the Marienplatz in Munich, in one of those cafés, where small gamblers diced on ‘tapestry’ mats. The air was full of politics, and the slap of cards.
汤米·巴尔班是一位统治者，汤米是一位英雄——迪克在慕尼黑玛利亚广场的一家咖啡馆里偶然遇见了他，那里的小赌徒们在“挂毯”垫子上掷骰子。空气中充满了政治和打牌的声音。

Tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh: ‘Um-buh—ha-ha! Um-buh—ha-ha!’ As a rule, he drank little; courage was his game and his companions were always a little afraid of him. Recently an eighth of the area of his skull had been removed by a Warsaw surgeon and was knitting under his hair, and the weakest person in the café could have killed him with a flip of a knotted napkin.
汤米坐在桌旁，放声大笑：“嗯——哈哈！”嗯——噗——哈哈哈！”他通常喝得很少。他的游戏就是勇敢，而他的同伴们总是有点害怕他。最近，他头骨的八分之​​一被华沙的外科医生切除，并在他的头发下编织，咖啡馆里最弱的人可能会用一张打结的餐巾翻转杀死他。

‘—this is Prince Chillicheff—‘ A battered, powder-gray Russian of fifty, ‘—and Mr. McKibben—and Mr. Hannan—‘ the latter was a lively ball of black eyes and hair, a clown; and he said immediately to Dick:
“——这是奇利切夫王子——”一个五十岁的、面色苍白、面色苍白的俄罗斯人，“——还有麦基本先生——还有汉南先生——”后者是一个活泼的黑眼睛和黑头发的球，一个小丑；他立即对迪克说：

‘The first thing before we shake hands—what do you mean by fooling around with my aunt?’
“握手之前的第一件事——你跟我姑姑鬼混是什么意思？”

‘Why, I—‘
'为什么我-'

‘You heard me. What are you doing here in Munich anyhow?’
‘你听到我说的话了。你来慕尼黑做什么？

‘Um-bah—ha-ha!’ laughed Tommy.
“嗯——哈哈哈！”汤米笑道。

‘Haven’t you got aunts of your own? Why don’t you fool with them?’
‘你没有自己的阿姨吗？你为什么不愚弄他们呢？

Dick laughed, whereupon the man shifted his attack:
迪克笑了一声，那人便转移了攻击：

‘Now let’s not have any more talk about aunts. How do I know you didn’t make up the whole thing? Here you are a complete stranger with an acquaintance of less than half an hour, and you come up to me with a cock-and-bull story about your aunts. How do I know what you have concealed about you?’
‘现在我们不要再谈论阿姨了。我怎么知道这一切不是你编造的？在这里，你是一个完全陌生的人，认识还不到半小时，你就向我讲述了关于你阿姨们的荒唐故事。我怎么知道你隐瞒了什么？

Tommy laughed again, then he said good-naturedly, but firmly, ‘That’s enough, Carly. Sit down, Dick—how’re you? How’s Nicole?’
汤米又笑了，然后他和蔼但坚定地说：“够了，卡莉。”坐下，迪克——你好吗？妮可怎么样？

He did not like any man very much nor feel their presence with much intensity—he was all relaxed for combat; as a fine athlete playing secondary defense in any sport is really resting much of the time, while a lesser man only pretends to rest and is at a continual and self-destroying nervous tension.
他不太喜欢任何人，也不太强烈地感受到他们的存在——他在战斗中很放松；作为一名在任何运动中进行二级防守的优秀运动员，大部分时间实际上都是在休息，而一个较弱的人只是假装休息，并且处于持续的、自我毁灭的紧张状态中。

Hannan, not entirely suppressed, moved to an adjoining piano, and with recurring resentment on his face whenever he looked at Dick, played chords, from time to time muttering, ‘Your aunts,’ and, in a dying cadence, ‘I didn’t say aunts anyhow. I said pants.’
汉南并没有完全被压抑，他走到旁边的一架钢琴前，每当他看着迪克时，他的脸上就会反复出现怨恨，弹奏和弦，时不时地咕哝着，“你的阿姨们”，然后，以一种垂死的节奏，“我没有”无论如何，不​​要说阿姨。我说裤子。

‘Well, how’re you?’ repeated Tommy. ‘You don’t look so—‘ he fought for a word, ‘—so jaunty as you used to, so spruce, you know what I mean.’
“嗯，你好吗？”汤米重复道。 “你看起来不像——”他拼命想找一个词，“——像以前那样高兴，那么整洁，你知道我的意思。”

The remark sounded too much like one of those irritating accusations of waning vitality and Dick was about to retort by commenting on the extraordinary suits worn by Tommy and Prince Chillicheff, suits of a cut and pattern fantastic enough to have sauntered down Beale Street on a Sunday—when an explanation was forthcoming.
这句话听起来太像是对活力衰退的恼人指责之一，迪克正要反驳汤米和奇利切夫王子所穿的非凡西装，这些西装的剪裁和图案都非常出色，足以在周日漫步在比尔街。 ——当解释即将到来时。

‘I see you are regarding our clothes,’ said the Prince. ‘We have just come out of Russia.’
“我看出你在关心我们的衣服，”王子说。 “我们刚刚从俄罗斯出来。”

‘These were made in Poland by the court tailor,’ said Tommy. ‘That’s a fact—Pilsudski’s own tailor.’
“这些是由宫廷裁缝在波兰制作的，”汤米说。 “这是事实——毕苏斯基自己的裁缝。”

‘You’ve been touring?’ Dick asked.
“你一直在巡演吗？”迪克问。

They laughed, the Prince inordinately meanwhile clapping Tommy on the back.
他们大笑起来，同时王子还异常地拍着汤米的背。

‘Yes, we have been touring. That’s it, touring. We have made the grand Tour of all the Russias. In state.’
“是的，我们一直在巡演。就是这样，巡演。我们已经完成了整个俄罗斯的盛大环游。处于状态。

Dick waited for an explanation. It came from Mr. McKibben in two words.
迪克等待着一个解释。麦基本先生用两个词说出了这句话。

‘They escaped.’
“他们逃走了。”

‘Have you been prisoners in Russia?’
“你在俄罗斯当过囚犯吗？”

‘It was I,’ explained Prince Chillicheff, his dead yellow eyes staring at Dick. ‘Not a prisoner but in hiding.’
“是我，”奇利切夫王子解释道，他那双死气沉沉的黄眼睛盯着迪克。 “不是囚犯，而是躲藏起来的。”

‘Did you have much trouble getting out?’
“你出去有困难吗？”

‘Some trouble. We left three Red Guards dead at the border. Tommy left two—‘ He held up two fingers like a Frenchman—‘I left one.’
‘有些麻烦。我们让三名红卫兵死在边境。汤米留下了两根——”他像法国人一样举起两根手指——“我留下了一根。”

‘That’s the part I don’t understand,’ said Mr. McKibben. ‘Why they should have objected to your leaving.’
“这是我不明白的部分，”麦基本先生说。 “为什么他们应该反对你离开。”

Hannan turned from the piano and said, winking at the others: ‘Mac thinks a Marxian is somebody who went to St. Mark’s school.’
汉南从钢琴旁转过身来，对其他人挤挤眼，说道：“麦克认为马克思主义者就是上过圣马可学校的人。”

It was an escape story in the best tradition—an aristocrat hiding nine years with a former servant and working in a government bakery; the eighteen-year-old daughter in Paris who knew Tommy Barban... . During the narrative Dick decided that this parched papier mâché relic of the past was scarcely worth the lives of three young men. The question arose as to whether Tommy and Chillicheff had been frightened.
这是一个最传统的逃亡故事——一个贵族和一个前仆人一起躲藏了九年，在一家政府面包店工作；巴黎十八岁的女儿认识汤米·巴尔班……在叙述过程中，迪克认为，过去这个干燥的纸浆遗迹根本不值得三个年轻人的生命。问题是汤米和奇利切夫是否受到了惊吓。

‘When I was cold,’ Tommy said. ‘I always get scared when I’m cold. During the war I was always frightened when I was cold.’
“当我很冷的时候，”汤米说。 “当我冷的时候，我总是会感到害怕。战争期间，当我感到寒冷时，我总是感到害怕。

McKibben stood up.
麦基本站了起来。

‘I must leave. To-morrow morning I’m going to Innsbruck by car with my wife and children—and the governess.’
'我得走了。明天早上我要和我的妻子、孩子以及家庭女教师一起开车去因斯布鲁克。

‘I’m going there to-morrow, too,’ said Dick.
“我明天也要去那里，”迪克说。

‘Oh, are you?’ exclaimed McKibben. ‘Why not come with us? It’s a big Packard and there’s only my wife and my children and myself— and the governess—‘
“哦，是吗？”麦基本惊呼道。 ‘为什么不跟我们一起去？这是一辆大帕卡德车，里面只有我的妻子、孩子和我自己——还有家庭女教师——”

‘I can’t possibly—‘
“我不可能——”

‘Of course she’s not really a governess,’ McKibben concluded, looking rather pathetically at Dick. ‘As a matter of fact my wife knows your sister-in-law, Baby Warren.’
“当然，她并不是真正的家庭教师，”麦基本总结道，相当可怜地看着迪克。 “事实上，我妻子认识你的嫂子，宝贝沃伦。”

But Dick was not to be drawn in a blind contract.
但迪克不会被签订盲目合同。

‘I’ve promised to travel with two men.’
“我答应和两个男人一起旅行。”

‘Oh,’ McKibben’s face fell. ‘Well, I’ll say good-by.’ He unscrewed two blooded wire-hairs from a nearby table and departed; Dick pictured the jammed Packard pounding toward Innsbruck with the McKibbens and their children and their baggage and yapping dogs— and the governess.
“哦，”麦基本的脸沉了下来。 “好吧，我要说再见了。”他从旁边的桌子上拔下两根沾满血的金属丝，然后就离开了。迪克想象着被塞住的帕卡德号带着麦基本一家、他们的孩子、他们的行李、狂吠的狗，以及家庭女教师，猛冲向因斯布鲁克。

‘The paper says they know the man who killed him,’ said Tommy. ‘But his cousins did not want it in the papers, because it happened in a speakeasy. What do you think of that?’
“报纸上说他们认识杀了他的人，”汤米说。 “但他的堂兄弟们不希望这件事出现在报纸上，因为这件事发生在一家地下酒吧里。你对那个怎么想的？'

‘It’s what’s known as family pride.’
“这就是所谓的家庭自豪感。”

Hannan played a loud chord on the piano to attract attention to himself.
汉南在钢琴上弹奏出响亮的和弦，以吸引别人的注意。

‘I don’t believe his first stuff holds up,’ he said. ‘Even barring the Europeans there are a dozen Americans can do what North did.’
“我不相信他的第一个东西能站得住脚，”他说。 “即使除了欧洲人之外，还有十几个美国人可以做诺斯所做的事情。”

It was the first indication Dick had had that they were talking about Abe North.
这是迪克第一次感觉到他们正在谈论阿贝·诺斯。

‘The only difference is that Abe did it first,’ said Tommy.
“唯一的区别是亚伯先做了这件事，”汤米说。

‘I don’t agree,’ persisted Hannan. ‘He got the reputation for being a good musician because he drank so much that his friends had to explain him away somehow—‘
“我不同意，”汉南坚持道。 “他获得了优秀音乐家的声誉，因为他喝得太多，以至于他的朋友们不得不以某种方式解释他——”

‘What’s this about Abe North? What about him? Is he in a jam?’
‘安倍·诺斯这是怎么回事？那么他呢？他遇到麻烦了吗？

‘Didn’t you read The Herald this morning?’
“你今天早上没有读《先驱报》吗？”

‘No.’
'不。'

‘He’s dead. He was beaten to death in a speakeasy in New York. He just managed to crawl home to the Racquet Club to die—‘
'他死了。他在纽约的一家地下酒吧被殴打致死。他刚刚爬回网球俱乐部的家就死了——”

‘Abe North?’
“阿贝·诺斯？”

‘Yes, sure, they—‘
“是的，当然，他们——”

‘Abe North?’ Dick stood up. ‘Are you sure he’s dead?’
“阿贝·诺斯？”迪克站了起来。 “你确定他死了吗？”

Hannan turned around to McKibben: ‘It wasn’t the Racquet Club he crawled to—it was the Harvard Club. I’m sure he didn’t belong to the Racquet.’
汉南转身对麦基本说：“他爬去的不是网球俱乐部，而是哈佛俱乐部。”我确信他不属于 Racquet。

‘The paper said so,’ McKibben insisted.
“报纸上是这么说的，”麦基本坚持说。

‘It must have been a mistake. I’m quite sure.’
‘这肯定是一个错误。我很确定。

‘Beaten to death in a speakeasy.’
“在地下酒吧里被打死。”

‘But I happen to know most of the members of the Racquet Club,’ said Hannan. ‘It MUST have been the Harvard Club.’
“但我碰巧认识网球俱乐部的大多数成员，”汉南说。 “肯定是哈佛俱乐部。”

Dick got up, Tommy too. Prince Chillicheff started out of a wan study of nothing, perhaps of his chances of ever getting out of Russia, a study that had occupied him so long that it was doubtful if he could give it up immediately, and joined them in leaving.
迪克站了起来，汤米也站了起来。奇利切夫王子一开始只是在进行一项苍白的研究，也许是他离开俄罗斯的机会，这项研究已经占据了他这么长时间，以至于怀疑他是否可以立即放弃，然后和他们一起离开了。

‘Abe North beaten to death.’
“阿倍·诺斯被打死了。”

On the way to the hotel, a journey of which Dick was scarcely aware, Tommy said:
在迪克几乎没有意识到的去旅馆的路上，汤米说道：

‘We’re waiting for a tailor to finish some suits so we can get to Paris. I’m going into stock-broking and they wouldn’t take me if I showed up like this. Everybody in your country is making millions. Are you really leaving to-morrow? We can’t even have dinner with you. It seems the Prince had an old girl in Munich. He called her up but she’d been dead five years and we’re having dinner with the two daughters.’
“我们正在等待裁缝完成一些西装，这样我们就可以前往巴黎。我要进入股票经纪行业，如果我像这样出现，他们就不会接受我。你们国家的每个人都赚了数百万美元。你明天真的要走吗？我们甚至不能和你一起吃晚饭。看来王子在慕尼黑有一个老姑娘。他给她打电话，但她已经去世五年了，我们正在和两个女儿共进晚餐。

The Prince nodded.
王子点点头。

‘Perhaps I could have arranged for Doctor Diver.’
“也许我可以安排戴弗医生。”

‘No, no,’ said Dick hastily.
“不，不，”迪克急忙说道。

He slept deep and awoke to a slow mournful march passing his window. It was a long column of men in uniform, wearing the familiar helmet of 1914, thick men in frock coats and silk hats, burghers, aristocrats, plain men. It was a society of veterans going to lay wreaths on the tombs of the dead. The column marched slowly with a sort of swagger for a lost magnificence, a past effort, a forgotten sorrow. The faces were only formally sad but Dick’s lungs burst for a moment with regret for Abe’s death, and his own youth of ten years ago.
他睡得很沉，醒来时，窗外传来缓慢、悲伤的行进声。这是一长列穿着制服、戴着熟悉的 1914 年头盔的人，有穿着长袍、戴着丝绸帽子的粗壮男人，有市民、贵族、普通人。这是一个退伍军人协会，向死者的坟墓敬献花圈。队伍缓慢地行进，带着一种失落的辉煌、过去的努力、被遗忘的悲伤。他们脸上的表情只是表面上的悲伤，但迪克的肺部有一瞬间因对亚伯的死和自己十年前的青春而感到遗憾。

十八

He reached Innsbruck at dusk, sent his bags up to a hotel and walked into town. In the sunset the Emperor Maximilian knelt in prayer above his bronze mourners; a quartet of Jesuit novices paced and read in the university garden. The marble souvenirs of old sieges, marriages, anniversaries, faded quickly when the sun was down, and he had erbsen-suppe with würstchen cut up in it, drank four helles of Pilsener and refused a formidable dessert known as ‘kaiser-schmarren.’
他在黄昏时到达因斯布鲁克，将行李送到一家旅馆，然后步行进城。夕阳下，马克西米利安皇帝跪在他的青铜哀悼者上方祈祷。四个耶稣会新手在大学花园里踱步、读书。昔日的围城、婚姻、周年纪念日的大理石纪念品，在太阳落山时很快就消失了，他吃了一份切碎香肠的晚餐，喝了四杯比尔森啤酒，拒绝了一种名为“凯撒施马伦”的令人敬畏的甜点。

Despite the overhanging mountains Switzerland was far away, Nicole was far away. Walking in the garden later when it was quite dark he thought about her with detachment, loving her for her best self. He remembered once when the grass was damp and she came to him on hurried feet, her thin slippers drenched with dew. She stood upon his shoes nestling close and held up her face, showing it as a book open at a page.
尽管瑞士距离高山很远，但妮可也很远。后来天黑了，他在花园里散步时，他超然地想着她，爱着她最好的自己。他记得有一次，草地湿漉漉的，她脚步匆匆地向他走来，单薄的拖鞋沾满了露水。她紧紧地站在他的鞋子上，抬起脸，就像一本翻开的书。

‘Think how you love me,’ she whispered. ‘I don’t ask you to love me always like this, but I ask you to remember. Somewhere inside me there’ll always be the person I am to-night.’
“想想你有多爱我，”她低声说道。 ‘我不要求你永远这样爱我，但我要求你记住。在我内心的某个地方，永远都会有今晚的我。

But Dick had come away for his soul’s sake, and he began thinking about that. He had lost himself—he could not tell the hour when, or the day or the week, the month or the year. Once he had cut through things, solving the most complicated equations as the simplest problems of his simplest patients. Between the time he found Nicole flowering under a stone on the Zurichsee and the moment of his meeting with Rosemary the spear had been blunted.
但迪克是为了灵魂的缘故而离开的，他开始思考这一点。他迷失了自己——他无法分辨是在什么时候，是哪一天或哪一周，是哪一个月或哪一年。一旦他解决了问题，就可以像解决最简单的病人最简单的问题一样解决最复杂的方程。从他发现妮可在苏黎世湖的一块石头下绽放到他与罗斯玛丽见面的那一刻，长矛已经钝了。

Watching his father’s struggles in poor parishes had wedded a desire for money to an essentially unacquisitive nature. It was not a healthy necessity for security—he had never felt more sure of himself, more thoroughly his own man, than at the time of his marriage to Nicole. Yet he had been swallowed up like a gigolo, and somehow permitted his arsenal to be locked up in the Warren safety-deposit vaults.
看着他父亲在贫困教区的挣扎，他对金钱的渴望与本质上不贪婪的本性结合在一起。这并不是一种健康的安全需要——他从来没有像与妮可结婚时那样对自己更有信心，对自己的男人更加彻底。然而他却像一个舞男一样被吞掉了，并以某种方式允许他的军火库被锁在沃伦的保险箱里。

‘There should have been a settlement in the Continental style; but it isn’t over yet. I’ve wasted eight years teaching the rich the ABC’s of human decency, but I’m not done. I’ve got too many unplayed trumps in my hand.’
“应该有一个欧陆式的定居点；但这还没有结束。我已经浪费了八年时间向富人传授人类礼仪的基础知识，但我还没有完成。我手里有太多未打出的王牌。”

He loitered among the fallow rose bushes and the beds of damp sweet indistinguishable fern. It was warm for October but cool enough to wear a heavy tweed coat buttoned by a little elastic tape at the neck. A figure detached itself from the black shape of a tree and he knew it was the woman whom he had passed in the lobby coming out. He was in love with every pretty woman he saw now, their forms at a distance, their shadows on a wall.
他在休耕的玫瑰丛和潮湿、甜美、难以辨认的蕨类植物之间徘徊。十月的天气很暖和，但也足够凉爽，可以穿一件厚重的花呢外套，脖子上用一根小松紧带扣上纽扣。一个人影从一棵黑色的树上脱离了出来，他知道那是他在大厅里经过的那个女人走了出来。他爱上了他现在看到的每一个漂亮女人，她们的身影在远处，她们的影子在墙上。

Her back was toward him as she faced the lights of the town. He scratched a match that she must have heard, but she remained motionless.
她背对着他，面对着小镇的灯光。他划了一根火柴，她一定听到了，但她一动不动。

—Was it an invitation? Or an indication of obliviousness? He had long been outside of the world of simple desires and their fulfillments, and he was inept and uncertain. For all he knew there might be some code among the wanderers of obscure spas by which they found each other quickly.
——这是邀请函吗？还是疏忽的表现？他早已脱离了简单欲望及其实现的世界，他无能且不确定。据他所知，在不起眼的温泉疗养地的流浪者之间可能存在某种密码，通过这些密码他们可以很快找到彼此。

—Perhaps the next gesture was his. Strange children should smile at each other and say, ‘Let’s play.’
——也许下一个动作是他的。陌生的孩子应该互相微笑并说：“我们来玩吧。”

He moved closer, the shadow moved sideways. Possibly he would be snubbed like the scapegrace drummers he had heard of in youth. His heart beat loud in contact with the unprobed, undissected, unanalyzed, unaccounted for. Suddenly he turned away, and, as he did, the girl, too, broke the black frieze she made with the foliage, rounded a bench at a moderate but determined pace and took the path back to the hotel.
他走近了，影子移到了一边。也许他会像他年轻时听说过的那些无用的鼓手一样受到冷落。当他接触到未经探测、未经解剖、未经分析、无法解释的事物时，他的心跳得剧烈。突然，他转过身去，女孩也像他一样，打破了用树叶做成的黑色饰带，以温和但坚定的速度绕过一张长凳，走上回旅馆的路。

With a guide and two other men, Dick started up the Birkkarspitze next morning. It was a fine feeling once they were above the cowbells of the highest pastures—Dick looked forward to the night in the shack, enjoying his own fatigue, enjoying the captaincy of the guide, feeling a delight in his own anonymity. But at mid-day the weather changed to black sleet and hail and mountain thunder. Dick and one of the other climbers wanted to go on but the guide refused. Regretfully they struggled back to Innsbruck to start again to-morrow.
第二天早上，迪克在一名向导和另外两名男子的带领下开始了比尔卡尔峰。当他们飞到最高牧场的牛铃上方时，这种感觉真好——迪克期待着棚屋里的夜晚，享受着自己的疲劳，享受着向导的职位，享受着自己的匿名性。但到了中午，天气却变成了黑雨夹雪、冰雹和山雷。迪克和其他一名登山者想继续前进，但向导拒绝了。遗憾的是，他们艰难地返回因斯布鲁克，明天再出发。

After dinner and a bottle of heavy local wine in the deserted dining-room, he felt excited, without knowing why, until he began thinking of the garden. He had passed the girl in the lobby before supper and this time she had looked at him and approved of him, but it kept worrying him: Why? When I could have had a good share of the pretty women of my time for the asking, why start that now? With a wraith, with a fragment of my desire? Why?
吃完晚饭，在空荡荡的餐厅里喝了一瓶当地的重酒后，他不知为何感到兴奋，直到他开始想起花园。晚饭前他在大厅里经过了那个女孩，这一次她看着他并认可了他，但这一直让他担心：为什么？当我本来可以与我那个时代的漂亮女人分享很多的时候，为什么现在才开始呢？带着一个幽灵，带着我的欲望碎片？为什么？

His imagination pushed ahead—the old asceticism, the actual unfamiliarity, triumphed: God, I might as well go back to the Riviera and sleep with Janice Caricamento or the Wilburhazy girl. To belittle all these years with something cheap and easy?
他的想象力向前推进——旧的禁欲主义、实际的陌生感取得了胜利：上帝啊，我还不如回到里维埃拉去和贾尼丝·卡里卡门托或威尔伯哈齐女孩一起睡觉。用便宜又简单的东西来贬低这些年？

He was still excited, though, and he turned from the veranda and went up to his room to think. Being alone in body and spirit begets loneliness, and loneliness begets more loneliness.
但他仍然很兴奋，他从阳台上转身，走进自己的房间思考。身体和精神上的孤独会产生孤独，而孤独又会产生更多的孤独。

Upstairs he walked around thinking of the matter and laying out his climbing clothes advantageously on the faint heater; he again encountered Nicole’s telegram, still unopened, with which diurnally she accompanied his itinerary. He had delayed opening it before supper—perhaps because of the garden. It was a cablegram from Buffalo, forwarded through Zurich.
他在楼上走来走去，想着这件事，并把登山服放在微弱的暖气上。他再次看到妮可的电报，仍未拆封，她每天都用这封电报陪伴他的行程。他推迟了晚饭前打开它——也许是因为花园的缘故。这是一封从布法罗发来的电报，经苏黎世转发。

‘Your father died peacefully tonight. HOLMES.’
“你的父亲今晚安详地去世了。福尔摩斯。”

He felt a sharp wince at the shock, a gathering of the forces of resistance; then it rolled up through his loins and stomach and throat.
他因震惊而猛地皱起眉头，抵抗力量正在聚集。然后它滚过他的腰部、胃部和喉咙。

He read the message again. He sat down on the bed, breathing and staring; thinking first the old selfish child’s thought that comes with the death of a parent, how will it affect me now that this earliest and strongest of protections is gone?
他又读了一遍这条信息。他坐在床上，呼吸着，凝视着。首先想想随着父母的去世而产生的自私的老孩子的想法，既然这个最早、最有力的保护已经消失，它会对我产生什么影响？

The atavism passed and he walked the room still, stopping from time to time to look at the telegram. Holmes was formally his father’s curate but actually, and for a decade, rector of the church. How did he die? Of old age—he was seventy-five. He had lived a long time.
返祖现象过去了，他仍然在房间里走来走去，时不时停下来看看电报。福尔摩斯名义上是他父亲的副牧师，但实​​际上，他在长达十年的时间里一直担任教堂的教区长。他怎么死的？年老了——他已经七十五岁了。他已经活了很长一段时间了。

Dick felt sad that he had died alone—he had survived his wife, and his brothers and sisters; there were cousins in Virginia but they were poor and not able to come North, and Holmes had had to sign the telegram. Dick loved his father—again and again he referred judgments to what his father would probably have thought or done. Dick was born several months after the death of two young sisters and his father, guessing what would be the effect on Dick’s mother, had saved him from a spoiling by becoming his moral guide. He was of tired stock yet he raised himself to that effort.
迪克为自己孤独地死去而感到悲伤——他比妻子、兄弟姐妹还活着；他还活着。弗吉尼亚有表兄弟，但他们很穷，无法北上，福尔摩斯不得不在电报上签字。迪克爱他的父亲——他一次又一次地根据他父亲可能会怎么想或怎么做来做出判断。迪克在两个妹妹去世几个月后出生，他的父亲猜测这会对迪克的母亲产生什么影响，于是成为他的道德导师，使他免于被宠坏。他已经疲惫不堪，但他仍奋起努力。

In the summer father and son walked downtown together to have their shoes shined—Dick in his starched duck sailor suit, his father always in beautifully cut clerical clothes—and the father was very proud of his handsome little boy. He told Dick all he knew about life, not much but most of it true, simple things, matters of behavior that came within his clergyman’s range. ‘Once in a strange town when I was first ordained, I went into a crowded room and was confused as to who was my hostess. Several people I knew came toward me, but I disregarded them because I had seen a grayhaired woman sitting by a window far across the room. I went over to her and introduced myself. After that I made many friends in that town.’
夏天，父子俩一起到市中心去擦鞋——迪克穿着笔挺的鸭子水手服，他的父亲总是穿着剪裁精美的牧师服——父亲为他英俊的小男孩感到非常自豪。他告诉迪克他所知道的关于生活的一切，虽然不多，但大部分是真实的、简单的事情，是他牧师能力范围内的行为问题。 “当我第一次出家时，有一次在一个陌生的城镇，我走进一个拥挤的房间，很困惑谁是我的女主人。有几个我认识的人向我走来，但我没有理睬他们，因为我看到一个灰发女人坐在房间对面的窗户旁。我走到她跟前，做了自我介绍。从那以后，我在那个镇上结识了很多朋友。”

His father had done that from a good heart—his father had been sure of what he was, with a deep pride of the two proud widows who had raised him to believe that nothing could be superior to ‘good instincts,’ honor, courtesy, and courage.
他的父亲这样做是出于一颗善良的心——他的父亲一直确信他是什么人，带着两个骄傲的寡妇的深深的自豪感，她们养大了他，让他相信没有什么比“良好的本能”、荣誉、礼貌、和勇气。

The father always considered that his wife’s small fortune belonged to his son, and in college and in medical school sent him a check for all of it four times a year. He was one of those about whom it was said with smug finality in the gilded age: ‘very much the gentleman, but not much get-up-and-go about him.’
父亲一直认为妻子的小笔财产属于儿子，在大学和医学院时，每年四次寄给他一张支票，用于支付全部财产。他是镀金时代人们对他自鸣得意的人之一：“很有绅士风度，但不太起床。”

... Dick sent down for a newspaper. Still pacing to and from the telegram open on his bureau, he chose a ship to go to America. Then he put in a call for Nicole in Zurich, remembering so many things as he waited, and wishing he had always been as good as he had intended to be.
……迪克派人去取一份报纸。他仍然在办公室里的电报上来回踱步，选择了一艘去美国的船。然后他给苏黎世的妮可打了电话，在等待的过程中想起了很多事情，并希望自己一直都像他想要的那样好。

十九

For an hour, tied up with his profound reaction to his father’s death, the magnificent façade of the homeland, the harbor of New York, seemed all sad and glorious to Dick, but once ashore the feeling vanished, nor did he find it again in the streets or the hotels or the trains that bore him first to Buffalo, and then south to Virginia with his father’s body. Only as the local train shambled into the low-forested clayland of Westmoreland County, did he feel once more identified with his surroundings; at the station he saw a star he knew, and a cold moon bright over Chesapeake Bay; he heard the rasping wheels of buckboards turning, the lovely fatuous voices, the sound of sluggish primeval rivers flowing softly under soft Indian names.
一个小时里，迪克沉浸在对父亲去世的深刻反应中，故乡的宏伟外观、纽约港对迪克来说似乎既悲伤又光荣，但一旦上岸，这种感觉就消失了，他也没有再找到这种感觉。街道、旅馆或火车首先把他带到布法罗，然后带着他父亲的尸体南下到弗吉尼亚。只有当当地的火车摇摇晃晃地驶入威斯特摩兰县低矮森林的粘土地时，他才再次感到自己与周围的环境融为一体。在车站，他看到了一颗他认识的星星，还有切萨皮克湾上空明亮的冷月。他听到四轮马车的轮子转动时发出的刺耳声音，可爱而愚蠢的声音，以及原始河流在柔和的印第安名字下缓缓流淌的声音。

Next day at the churchyard his father was laid among a hundred Divers, Dorseys, and Hunters. It was very friendly leaving him there with all his relations around him. Flowers were scattered on the brown unsettled earth. Dick had no more ties here now and did not believe he would come back. He knelt on the hard soil. These dead, he knew them all, their weather-beaten faces with blue flashing eyes, the spare violent bodies, the souls made of new earth in the forest-heavy darkness of the seventeenth century.
第二天，在教堂墓地，他的父亲被安葬在一百名潜水员、多西人和猎人中间。让他和他所有的亲戚都在他身边是非常友好的。鲜花散落在棕色的、不稳定的土地上。迪克现在与这里不再有联系，也不相信他会回来。他跪在坚硬的土地上。这些死者，他全都认识，他们饱经风霜的脸，蓝色的眼睛闪烁着光芒，他们残暴的身体，在十七世纪森林密布的黑暗中由新土组成的灵魂。

‘Good-by, my father—good-by, all my fathers.’
“再见，我的父亲——再见，我所有的父亲。”

On the long-roofed steamship piers one is in a country that is no longer here and not yet there. The hazy yellow vault is full of echoing shouts. There are the rumble of trucks and the clump of trunks, the strident chatter of cranes, the first salt smell of the sea. One hurries through, even though there’s time; the past, the continent, is behind; the future is the glowing mouth in the side of the ship; the dim, turbulent alley is too confusedly the present.
在长顶轮船码头上，你身处一个已不复存在、也尚未存在的国家。朦胧的黄色穹顶里充满了回荡的叫喊声。卡车的隆隆声、箱子的隆隆声、起重机刺耳的声音、大海的第一股咸味。尽管还有时间，但还是匆匆而过；过去，大陆，已经过去了；未来是船舷上发光的嘴；昏暗、喧闹的小巷太混乱了。

Up the gangplank and the vision of the world adjusts itself, narrows. One is a citizen of a commonwealth smaller than Andorra, no longer sure of anything. The men at the purser’s desk are as oddly shaped as the cabins; disdainful are the eyes of voyagers and their friends. Next the loud mournful whistles, the portentous vibration and the boat, the human idea—is in motion. The pier and its faces slide by and for a moment the boat is a piece accidentally split off from them; the faces become remote, voiceless, the pier is one of many blurs along the water front. The harbor flows swiftly toward the sea.
走上跳板，世界的视野就会自我调整、变窄。一个是比安道尔小的联邦的公民，对任何事情都不再有把握。事务长办公桌上的人的形状和船舱一样奇怪。航海者和他们的朋友的目光充满了蔑视。接下来是响亮的哀伤的口哨声、不祥的振动和船，人类的想法——正在运动。码头和它的表面滑过，有那么一刻，船是不小心从它们身上分离出来的一部分；人们的面孔变得遥远、无声，码头只是海滨沿岸众多模糊的事物之一。港口的水流迅速流向大海。

With it flowed Albert McKisco, labelled by the newspapers as its most precious cargo. McKisco was having a vogue. His novels were pastiches of the work of the best people of his time, a feat not to be disparaged, and in addition he possessed a gift for softening and debasing what he borrowed, so that many readers were charmed by the ease with which they could follow him. Success had improved him and humbled him. He was no fool about his capacities—he realized that he possessed more vitality than many men of superior talent, and he was resolved to enjoy the success he had earned. ‘I’ve done nothing yet,’ he would say. ‘I don’t think I’ve got any real genius. But if I keep trying I may write a good book.’ Fine dives have been made from flimsier spring-boards. The innumerable snubs of the past were forgotten. Indeed, his success was founded psychologically upon his duel with Tommy Barban, upon the basis of which, as it withered in his memory, he had created, afresh, a new self-respect.
随之而来的是阿尔伯特·麦基斯科（Albert McKisco），报纸将其称为最珍贵的货物。麦基斯科正在流行。 ”跟着他。成功使他进步，也使他谦卑。他对自己的能力并不傻——他意识到自己比许多才华横溢的人更有活力，而且他决心享受自己所赢得的成功。他会说：“我什么也没做。” “我不认为我有任何真正的天才。但如果我继续努力，我可能会写一本好书。” 出色的跳水是由脆弱的跳板完成的。过去无数的冷落都被遗忘了。事实上，他的成功在心理上是建立在他与汤米·巴尔班决斗的基础上的，在此基础上，当它在他的记忆中枯萎时，他重新创造了一种新的自尊。

Spotting Dick Diver the second day out, he eyed him tentatively, then introduced himself in a friendly way and sat down. Dick laid aside his reading and, after the few minutes that it took to realize the change in McKisco, the disappearance of the man’s annoying sense of inferiority, found himself pleased to talk to him. McKisco was ‘well-informed’ on a range of subjects wider than Goethe’s—it was interesting to listen to the innumerable facile combinations that he referred to as his opinions. They struck up an acquaintance, and Dick had several meals with them. The McKiscos had been invited to sit at the captain’s table but with nascent snobbery they told Dick that they ‘couldn’t stand that bunch.’
第二天他在外面发现了迪克·戴弗，他试探性地看了他一眼，然后友好地做了自我介绍，然后坐下了。迪克放下了书本，几分钟后才意识到麦基斯科的变化，他烦人的自卑感消失了，他发现自己很高兴能和他交谈。麦基斯科对比歌德更广泛的一系列主题都“消息灵通”——聆听他称之为自己观点的无数轻松组合是很有趣的。他们结识了一个熟人，迪克和他们一起吃了几顿饭。麦基斯科夫妇被邀请坐在船长席，但带着初生的势利，他们告诉迪克，他们“无法忍受那群人”。

Violet was very grand now, decked out by the grand couturières, charmed about the little discoveries that well-bred girls make in their teens. She could, indeed, have learned them from her mother in Boise but her soul was born dismally in the small movie houses of Idaho, and she had had no time for her mother. Now she ‘belonged’—together with several million other people—and she was happy, though her husband still shushed her when she grew violently naïve.
维奥莱特现在非常盛大，被伟大的女裁缝们打扮得漂漂亮亮的，对有教养的女孩在十几岁时的小发现很着迷。事实上，她本可以从她在博伊西的母亲那里学到这些，但她的灵魂在爱达荷州的小电影院里惨淡地诞生，她没有时间陪伴她的母亲。现在，她与其他数百万人一起“属于”了她，她很高兴，尽管当她变得天真得天真时，她的丈夫仍然让她闭嘴。

The McKiscos got off at Gibraltar. Next evening in Naples Dick picked up a lost and miserable family of two girls and their mother in the bus from the hotel to the station. He had seen them on the ship. An overwhelming desire to help, or to be admired, came over him: he showed them fragments of gaiety; tentatively he bought them wine, with pleasure saw them begin to regain their proper egotism. He pretended they were this and that, and falling in with his own plot, and drinking too much to sustain the illusion, and all this time the women, thought only that this was a windfall from heaven. He withdrew from them as the night waned and the train rocked and snorted at Cassino and Frosinone. After weird American partings in the station at Rome, Dick went to the Hotel Quirinal, somewhat exhausted.
麦基斯科夫妇在直布罗陀下车。第二天晚上，迪克在那不勒斯从酒店到车站的公共汽车上接了一个迷失而悲惨的家庭，有两个女孩和她们的母亲。他在船上见过他们。他强烈地想要帮助别人，或者被人钦佩：他向他们展示了一些欢乐的片段；他试探性地给他们买了酒，很高兴看到他们开始恢复应有的自我主义。他假装她们是这样那样的，陷入了自己的阴谋，又喝得太多以维持幻觉，而一直以来，女人们只以为这是天降横财。夜幕降临，火车摇摇晃晃，呼啸着驶向卡西诺和弗罗西诺内，他离开了他们。在罗马车站与美国人奇怪地分别后，迪克去了奎里纳尔酒店，有些疲惫。

At the desk he suddenly stared and upped his head. As if a drink were acting on him, warming the lining of his stomach, throwing a flush up into his brain, he saw the person he had come to see, the person for whom he had made the Mediterranean crossing.
办公桌前，他突然抬起头来。仿佛一杯酒作用在他身上，温暖了他的胃壁，让他的大脑一阵潮红，他看到了他来见的人，他为之横渡地中海的人。

Simultaneously Rosemary saw him, acknowledging him before placing him; she looked back startled, and, leaving the girl she was with, she hurried over. Holding himself erect, holding his breath, Dick turned to her. As she came across the lobby, her beauty all groomed, like a young horse dosed with Black-seed oil, and hoops varnished, shocked him awake; but it all came too quick for him to do anything except conceal his fatigue as best he could. To meet her starry-eyed confidence he mustered an insincere pantomime implying, ‘You WOULD turn up here—of all the people in the world.’
与此同时，罗斯玛丽看到了他，在把他安置好之前向他打招呼。她回头一惊，丢下身边的女孩，快步走了过去。迪克挺直身体，屏住呼吸，转向她。当她穿过大厅时，她的美貌打扮得漂漂亮亮，就像一匹抹过黑籽油的小马，箍着漆，这让他惊醒了。但这一切来得太快，他除了尽力掩饰自己的疲倦之外，无能为力。为了满足她不切实际的自信，他表演了一场不真诚的哑剧，暗示：“在世界上所有人中，你会出现在这里。”

Her gloved hands closed over his on the desk; ‘Dick—we’re making The Grandeur that was Rome—at least we think we are; we may quit any day.’
她戴着手套的手放在桌子上，放在他的手上。 “迪克——我们正在制作罗马的宏伟——至少我们认为是；我们随时都可能退出。

He looked at her hard, trying to make her a little self-conscious, so that she would observe less closely his unshaven face, his crumpled and slept-in collar. Fortunately, she was in a hurry.
他用力地看着她，试图让她有点难为情，这样她就不会那么仔细地观察他那张没刮胡子的脸和他那皱巴巴的、睡着了的衣领。幸好，她赶时间。

‘We begin early because the mists rise at eleven—phone me at two.’
“我们很早就出发，因为十一点起雾——两点给我打电话。”

In his room Dick collected his faculties. He left a call for noon, stripped off his clothes and dove literally into a heavy sleep.
迪克在他的房间里恢复了他的能力。他中午留下了电话，脱掉衣服，沉沉睡去。

He slept over the phone call but awoke at two, refreshed. Unpacking his bag, he sent out suits and laundry. He shaved, lay for half an hour in a warm bath and had breakfast. The sun had dipped into the Via Nazionale and he let it through the portières with a jingling of old brass rings. Waiting for a suit to be pressed, he discovered from the Corriere della Sera that ‘una novella di Sinclair Lewis ‘Wall Street’ nella quale autore analizza la vita sociale di una piccola citta Americana.’ Then he tried to think about Rosemary.
他在电话中睡着了，但两点就醒了，神清气爽。他打开包，送出了西装和洗好的衣服。他刮了胡子，在温水浴中躺了半个小时，然后吃了早餐。太阳已经照进了国家大街，他让阳光穿过门廊，发出旧铜环的叮当声。在等待打西装的时候，他从《晚邮报》上发现“辛克莱·刘易斯的《华尔街》中篇小说nella quale autore analizza la vita Sociale di una piccola citta Americana”。然后他试着去想罗斯玛丽。

At first he thought nothing. She was young and magnetic, but so was Topsy. He guessed that she had had lovers and had loved them in the last four years. Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people’s lives. Yet from this fog his affection emerged—the best contacts are when one knows the obstacles and still wants to preserve a relation. The past drifted back and he wanted to hold her eloquent giving-of-herself in its precious shell, till he enclosed it, till it no longer existed outside him. He tried to collect all that might attract her—it was less than it had been four years ago. Eighteen might look at thirty-four through a rising mist of adolescence; but twenty-two would see thirty-eight with discerning clarity. Moreover, Dick had been at an emotional peak at the time of the previous encounter; since then there had been a lesion of enthusiasm.
起初他什么也没想。她年轻而有魅力，托普西也是如此。他猜测她已经有过情人，并且在过去的四年里一直爱着他们。嗯，你永远不知道你在人们的生活中占据了多少空间。然而，他的感情从这迷雾中显现出来——最好的接触是当一个人知道有障碍但仍然想维持一种关系时。过去的时光一闪而过，他想把她雄辩的自我奉献收进那珍贵的外壳里，直到他把它包起来，直到它不再存在于他之外。他试图收集所有可能吸引她的东西——但比四年前要少。十八岁可能会透过青春期的迷雾来看待三十四岁；但二十二人可以清晰地看到三十八人。而且，上次见面时，迪克正处于情绪高峰期，所以，他的情绪非常激动。从那时起，热情就受到了损害。

When the valet returned he put on a white shirt and collar and a black tie with a pearl; the cords of his reading-glasses passed through another pearl of the same size that swung a casual inch below. After sleep, his face had resumed the ruddy brown of many Riviera summers, and to limber himself up he stood on his hands on a chair until his fountain pen and coins fell out. At three he called Rosemary and was bidden to come up. Momentarily dizzy from his acrobatics, he stopped in the bar for a gin-and-tonic.
当男仆回来时，他穿上了一件白衬衫和白衣领，系了一条镶有珍珠的黑领带；他老花镜的灯带穿过另一颗同样大小的珍​​珠，珍珠在下面一英寸处随意摆动。入睡后，他的脸又恢复了许多里维埃拉夏天的红棕色，为了让自己活动一下，他双手撑在椅子上，直到钢笔和硬币掉了出来。三点钟，他打电话给罗斯玛丽，并被邀请过来。他因杂技表演而暂时感到头晕，于是在酒吧停下来喝了一杯杜松子酒。

‘Hi, Doctor Diver!’
“嗨，戴弗医生！”

Only because of Rosemary’s presence in the hotel did Dick place the man immediately as Collis Clay. He had his old confidence and an air of prosperity and big sudden jowls.
正是因为罗斯玛丽出现在酒店，迪克才立即认定这个人就是科利斯·克莱。他依然保持着往日的自信，一副繁荣昌盛的样子，下巴突然变得很大。

‘Do you know Rosemary’s here?’ Collis asked.
“你知道罗斯玛丽在这里吗？”科利斯问道。

‘I ran into her.’
“我撞见了她。”

‘I was in Florence and I heard she was here so I came down last week. You’d never know Mama’s little girl.’ He modified the remark, ‘I mean she was so carefully brought up and now she’s a woman of the world—if you know what I mean. Believe me, has she got some of these Roman boys tied up in bags! And how!’
“我当时在佛罗伦萨，听说她在这里，所以上周我就下来了。你永远不会了解妈妈的小女儿。”他修改了这句话，“我的意思是，她是被精心抚养长大的，现在她是一个世界级的女人——如果你明白我的意思的话。相信我，她有没有把一些罗马男孩绑在袋子里！如何！'

‘You studying in Florence?’
“你在佛罗伦萨读书吗？”

‘Me? Sure, I’m studying architecture there. I go back Sunday—I’m staying for the races.’
'我？当然，我在那里学习建筑。我周日回去——我会留下来参加比赛。

With difficulty Dick restrained him from adding the drink to the account he carried in the bar, like a stock-market report.
迪克费力地阻止他把饮料添加到他在酒吧里的账户上，就像一份股市报告一样。

XX

When Dick got out of the elevator he followed a tortuous corridor and turned at length toward a distant voice outside a lighted door. Rosemary was in black pajamas; a luncheon table was still in the room; she was having coffee.
当迪克走出电梯时，他沿着一条曲折的走廊，最后转向一扇灯火通明的门外远处传来的声音。罗斯玛丽穿着黑色睡衣。房间里还留着一张午餐桌。她正在喝咖啡。

‘You’re still beautiful,’ he said. ‘A little more beautiful than ever.’
他说：“你还是那么漂亮。” “比以前更美丽一点。”

‘Do you want coffee, youngster?’
“年轻人，你想喝咖啡吗？”

‘I’m sorry I was so unpresentable this morning.’
“对不起，我今天早上表现得很不礼貌。”

‘You didn’t look well—you all right now? Want coffee?’
“你看起来不太好——现在还好吗？要咖啡吗？

‘No, thanks.’
'不，谢谢。'

‘You’re fine again, I was scared this morning. Mother’s coming over next month, if the company stays. She always asks me if I’ve seen you over here, as if she thought we were living next door. Mother always liked you—she always felt you were some one I ought to know.’
“你又好了，今天早上我很害怕。”如果公司留下的话，妈妈下个月就会过来。她总是问我是否在这里见过你，就好像她以为我们就住在隔壁一样。妈妈一直很喜欢你——她总觉得你是我应该认识的人。”

‘Well, I’m glad she still thinks of me.’
“嗯，我很高兴她仍然想着我。”

‘Oh, she does,’ Rosemary reassured him. ‘A very great deal.’
“哦，她会的，”罗斯玛丽向他保证。 “非常划算。”

‘I’ve seen you here and there in pictures,’ said Dick. ‘Once I had Daddy’s Girl run off just for myself!’
“我在照片里到处都见过你，”迪克说。 “有一次我让爸爸的女儿为了我自己跑了！”

‘I have a good part in this one if it isn’t cut.’
“如果不被剪掉的话，我在这部电影中会扮演一个很好的角色。”

She crossed behind him, touching his shoulder as she passed. She phoned for the table to be taken away and settled in a big chair.
她从他身后走过，经过时碰触了他的肩膀。她打电话要求把桌子拿走，坐在一张大椅子上。

‘I was just a little girl when I met you, Dick. Now I’m a woman.’
“当我遇见你时，我只是一个小女孩，迪克。现在我是个女人了。

‘I want to hear everything about you.’
“我想听听关于你的一切。”

‘How is Nicole—and Lanier and Topsy?’
“妮可、拉尼尔和托普西怎么样？”

‘They’re fine. They often speak of you—‘
'他们很好。他们经常谈到你——”

The phone rang. While she answered it Dick examined two novels— one by Edna Ferber, one by Albert McKisco. The waiter came for the table; bereft of its presence Rosemary seemed more alone in her black pajamas.
电话响了。在她回答的同时，迪克检查了两本小说——一本是埃德娜·费伯的，一本是阿尔伯特·麦基斯科的。服务员过来拿桌子；失去了它的存在，穿着黑色睡衣的罗斯玛丽显得更加孤独。

‘... I have a caller... . No, not very well. I’ve got to go to the costumer’s for a long fitting... . No, not now ...’
‘……我有一个来电者……不，不太好。我得去服装店做一次长时间的试穿……不，不是现在……”

As though with the disappearance of the table she felt released, Rosemary smiled at Dick—that smile as if they two together had managed to get rid of all the trouble in the world and were now at peace in their own heaven ...
仿佛随着桌子的消失，她感到如释重负，迷迭香对迪克微笑——那微笑就好像他们两个一起成功地摆脱了世界上所有的麻烦，现在在自己的天堂里得到了平静……

‘That’s done,’ she said. ‘Do you realize I’ve spent the last hour getting ready for you?’
“完成了，”她说。 “你知道我花了最后一个小时为你做准备吗？”

But again the phone called her. Dick got up to change his hat from the bed to the luggage stand, and in alarm Rosemary put her hand over the mouthpiece of the phone. ‘You’re not going!’
但电话又打给了她。迪克起身将帽子从床上换到行李架上，罗斯玛丽惊慌地把手放在电话听筒上。 “你不走！”

‘No.’
'不。'

When the communication was over he tried to drag the afternoon together saying: ‘I expect some nourishment from people now.’
沟通结束后，他试图拖延整个下午的时间，他说：“我现在希望人们能提供一些营养。”

‘Me too,’ Rosemary agreed. ‘The man that just phoned me once knew a second cousin of mine. Imagine calling anybody up for a reason like that!’
“我也是，”罗斯玛丽同意道。 “刚才给我打电话的那个人曾经认识我的一个远房表弟。想象一下，出于这样的原因给任何人打电话！

Now she lowered the lights for love. Why else should she want to shut off his view of her? He sent his words to her like letters, as though they left him some time before they reached her.
现在她为了爱把灯调暗了。否则她为什么要阻止他看她呢？他把这些话像信件一样寄给她，仿佛这些话在到达她之前就已经离开了他一段时间。

‘Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you.’ Then they kissed passionately in the centre of the floor. She pressed against him, and went back to her chair.
“很难坐在这里离你很近，又不亲吻你。”然后他们在地板中央热情地接吻。她压住他，然后回到椅子上。

It could not go on being merely pleasant in the room. Forward or backward; when the phone rang once more he strolled into the bedchamber and lay down on her bed, opening Albert McKisco’s novel. Presently Rosemary came in and sat beside him.
房间里不能再仅仅令人愉快了。向前或向后；当电话再次响起时，他走进卧室，躺在她的床上，打开阿尔伯特·麦基斯科的小说。不久，罗斯玛丽走了进来，坐在他旁边。

‘You have the longest eyelashes,’ she remarked.
“你的睫毛最长，”她说。

‘We are now back at the Junior Prom. Among those present are Miss Rosemary Hoyt, the eyelash fancier—‘
“我们现在回到少年舞会了。在场的人中有睫毛爱好者罗斯玛丽·霍伊特小姐——”

She kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay side by side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless. Her breathing was young and eager and exciting. Her lips were faintly chapped but soft in the corners.
她吻了他，他把她拉下来，让他们并排躺下，然后他们吻到两人都喘不过气来。她的呼吸年轻、急切、令人兴奋。她的嘴唇微微干裂，但嘴角却很柔软。

When they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles of his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she whispered, ‘No, not now—those things are rhythmic.’
当它们还是四肢、双脚和衣服、他的手臂和背部、她的喉咙和乳房时，她低声说道：“不，现在不是——这些东西都是有节奏的。”

Disciplined he crushed his passion into a corner of his mind, but bearing up her fragility on his arms until she was poised half a foot above him, he said lightly:
他自律地将自己的激情压入脑海的一角，却将她的脆弱抱在怀里，直到她在他上方半英尺处保持平衡，他轻轻地说：

‘Darling—that doesn’t matter.’
“亲爱的——那没关系。”

Her face had changed with his looking up at it; there was the eternal moonlight in it.
当他抬头看她时，她的脸色发生了变化。里面有永恒的月光。

‘That would be poetic justice if it should be you,’ she said. She twisted away from him, walked to the mirror, and boxed her disarranged hair with her hands. Presently she drew a chair close to the bed and stroked his cheek.
“如果是你的话，那将是诗意的正义，”她说。她转身离开他，走到镜子前，用手梳理了一下凌乱的头发。不久，她拉了一把椅子到床边，抚摸着他的脸颊。

‘Tell me the truth about you,’ he demanded.
“告诉我关于你的真相，”他要求道。

‘I always have.’
“我一直都是这样。”

‘In a way—but nothing hangs together.’
“在某种程度上——但没有任何联系。”

They both laughed but he pursued.
他们都笑了，但他追了上去。

‘Are you actually a virgin?’
“你真的是处女吗？”

‘No-o-o!’ she sang. ‘I’ve slept with six hundred and forty men—if that’s the answer you want.’
“不——哦——哦！”她唱道。 “我和六百四十个男人睡过——如果这就是你想要的答案的话。”

‘It’s none of my business.’
“这不关我的事。”

‘Do you want me for a case in psychology?’
“你想要我做一个心理学案例吗？”

‘Looking at you as a perfectly normal girl of twenty-two, living in the year nineteen twenty-eight, I guess you’ve taken a few shots at love.’
“看着你作为一个完全正常的二十二岁女孩，生活在十九二十八岁，我猜你已经对爱情进行了几次尝试。”

‘It’s all been—abortive,’ she said.
“这一切都——流产了，”她说。

Dick couldn’t believe her. He could not decide whether she was deliberately building a barrier between them or whether this was intended to make an eventual surrender more significant.
迪克不敢相信她。他无法确定她是否故意在他们之间建立障碍，或者这是否是为了让最终的投降变得更加重要。

‘Let’s go walk in the Pincio,’ he suggested.
“我们去 Pincio 散步吧，”他建议道。

He shook himself straight in his clothes and smoothed his hair. A moment had come and somehow passed. For three years Dick had been the ideal by which Rosemary measured other men and inevitably his stature had increased to heroic size. She did not want him to be like other men, yet here were the same exigent demands, as if he wanted to take some of herself away, carry it off in his pocket.
他在衣服里抖了抖身子，抚平了头发。某个时刻到来了，又不知何故过去了。三年来，迪克一直是罗斯玛丽衡量其他男人的理想对象，他的地位不可避免地提高到了英雄般的程度。她不想让他像其他男人一样，但这里却有着同样迫切的要求，仿佛他想把她的一部分带走，装进口袋里。

Walking on the greensward between cherubs and philosophers, fauns and falling water, she took his arm snugly, settling into it with a series of little readjustments, as if she wanted it to be right because it was going to be there forever. She plucked a twig and broke it, but she found no spring in it. Suddenly seeing what she wanted in Dick’s face she took his gloved hand and kissed it. Then she cavorted childishly for him until he smiled and she laughed and they began having a good time.
走在小天使和哲学家、农牧神和瀑布之间的绿地上，她紧紧地握住他的手臂，通过一系列的小调整来适应它，仿佛她希望它是正确的，因为它会永远在那里。她拔下一根树枝，折断了，但发现里面没有弹簧。突然，她从迪克的脸上看到了自己想要的东西，她握住他戴着手套的手，吻了吻它。然后她孩子气地为他欢闹，直到他笑了，她也笑了，他们开始玩得很开心。

‘I can’t go out with you to-night, darling, because I promised some people a long time ago. But if you’ll get up early I’ll take you out to the set to-morrow.’
“亲爱的，今晚我不能和你出去，因为我很久以前就答应过一些人。但如果你早起的话，明天我会带你去片场。”

He dined alone at the hotel, went to bed early, and met Rosemary in the lobby at half-past six. Beside him in the car she glowed away fresh and new in the morning sunshine. They went out through the Porta San Sebastiano and along the Appian Way until they came to the huge set of the forum, larger than the forum itself. Rosemary turned him over to a man who led him about the great props; the arches and tiers of seats and the sanded arena. She was working on a stage which represented a guard-room for Christian prisoners, and presently they went there and watched Nicotera, one of many hopeful Valentinos, strut and pose before a dozen female ‘captives,’ their eyes melancholy and startling with mascara.
他独自在酒店用餐，早早就睡觉了，六点半在大堂遇见了罗斯玛丽。车里他身边的她在早晨的阳光下显得焕然一新。他们穿过圣塞巴斯蒂亚诺门，沿着亚壁古道，来到了巨大的广场，比广场本身还大。罗斯玛丽把他交给了一个人，他带领他参观了巨大的道具。拱门、座位层和沙地竞技场。她正在一个代表基督徒囚犯看守室的舞台上工作，不久他们就到了那里，看着尼科泰拉，许多充满希望的瓦伦蒂诺之一，在十几个女性“俘虏”面前昂首阔步，摆出姿势，她们的眼神忧郁，睫毛膏令人震惊。

Rosemary appeared in a knee-length tunic.
罗斯玛丽穿着及膝长袍出现。

‘Watch this,’ she whispered to Dick. ‘I want your opinion. Everybody that’s seen the rushes says—‘
“注意这个，”她低声对迪克说。 ‘我想听听你的意见。每个见过灯心草的人都会说——”

‘What are the rushes?’
“什么是急事？”

‘When they run off what they took the day before. They say it’s the first thing I’ve had sex appeal in.’
“当他们跑掉前一天拿走的东西时。他们说这是我第一次感受到性感。”

‘I don’t notice it.’
“我没注意到。”

‘You wouldn’t! But I have.’
‘你不会的！但我有。'

Nicotera in his leopard skin talked attentively to Rosemary while the electrician discussed something with the director, meanwhile leaning on him. Finally the director pushed his hand off roughly and wiped a sweating forehead, and Dick’s guide remarked: ‘He’s on the hop again, and how!’
身穿豹皮的尼科泰拉聚精会神地与罗斯玛丽交谈，而电工则靠在他身上与主任讨论着什么。最后，导演粗暴地推开了他的手，擦了擦额头上的汗，迪克的向导说道：“他又开始跳了，怎么了！”

‘Who?’ asked Dick, but before the man could answer the director walked swiftly over to them.
“谁？”迪克问道，但还没等那人回答，导演就快步向他们走了过来。

‘Who’s on the hop—you’re on the hop yourself.’ He spoke vehemently to Dick, as if to a jury. ‘When he’s on the hop he always thinks everybody else is, and how!’ He glared at the guide a moment longer, then he clapped his hands: ‘All right—everybody on the set.’
“谁在跳跃——你自己也在跳跃。”他激烈地对迪克说话，就像对陪审团一样。 “当他在忙碌的时候，他总是认为其他人都是如此，而且怎么会这样！”他又瞪了导游一会儿，然后拍了拍手：“好吧——片场的每个人。”

It was like visiting a great turbulent family. An actress approached Dick and talked to him for five minutes under the impression that he was an actor recently arrived from London. Discovering her mistake she scuttled away in panic. The majority of the company felt either sharply superior or sharply inferior to the world outside, but the former feeling prevailed. They were people of bravery and industry; they were risen to a position of prominence in a nation that for a decade had wanted only to be entertained.
这就像拜访一个动荡的大家庭。一位女演员走近迪克并与他交谈了五分钟，以为他是刚从伦敦抵达的演员。发现自己的错误后，她惊慌失措地逃走了。公司的大多数人要么感觉自己比外面的世界明显优越，要么感觉自己比外面的世界明显低人一等，但前者的感觉占了上风。他们是勇敢而勤奋的人；在这个十年来只想娱乐的国家里，他们获得了显要的地位。

The session ended as the light grew misty—a fine light for painters, but, for the camera, not to be compared with the clear California air. Nicotera followed Rosemary to the car and whispered something to her—she looked at him without smiling as she said good-by.
会议在光线变得朦胧时结束——对于画家来说这是一个很好的光线，但对于相机来说，却无法与加州清澈的空气相比。尼科泰拉跟着罗斯玛丽上了车，低声对她说了些什么——她在道别时没有微笑地看着他。

Dick and Rosemary had luncheon at the Castelli dei Cæsari, a splendid restaurant in a high-terraced villa overlooking the ruined forum of an undetermined period of the decadence. Rosemary took a cocktail and a little wine, and Dick took enough so that his feeling of dissatisfaction left him. Afterward they drove back to the hotel, all flushed and happy, in a sort of exalted quiet. She wanted to be taken and she was, and what had begun with a childish infatuation on a beach was accomplished at last.
迪克和罗斯玛丽在凯萨里城堡 (Castelli dei Cæsari) 吃午饭，这是一家位于高露台别墅内的华丽餐厅，俯瞰着未确定的颓废时期的废墟广场。罗斯玛丽喝了一杯鸡尾酒和一点酒，迪克喝了足够多的酒，以至于他的不满情绪消失了。随后，他们驱车返回旅馆，脸色通红，心情愉悦，气氛异常安静。她想要被带走，而她确实被带走了，从海滩上幼稚的迷恋开始的一切终于完成了。

XXI
二十一

Rosemary had another dinner date, a birthday party for a member of the company. Dick ran into Collis Clay in the lobby, but he wanted to dine alone, and pretended an engagement at the Excelsior. He drank a cocktail with Collis and his vague dissatisfaction crystallized as impatience—he no longer had an excuse for playing truant to the clinic. This was less an infatuation than a romantic memory. Nicole was his girl—too often he was sick at heart about her, yet she was his girl. Time with Rosemary was self-indulgence— time with Collis was nothing plus nothing.
罗斯玛丽还有另一次晚餐约会，为公司一名成员举办的生日聚会。迪克在大堂遇到了科利斯·克莱，但他想独自用餐，并假装在怡东酒店有约会。他和科利斯一起喝了一杯鸡尾酒，他隐隐约约的不满变成了不耐烦——他不再有理由逃学。这与其说是迷恋，不如说是一段浪漫的回忆。妮可是他的女孩——他常常对她心生厌恶，但她却是他的女孩。和罗斯玛丽在一起的时间是自我放纵——和科利斯在一起的时间什么也不是。

In the doorway of the Excelsior he ran into Baby Warren. Her large beautiful eyes, looking precisely like marbles, stared at him with surprise and curiosity. ‘I thought you were in America, Dick! Is Nicole with you?’
在怡东酒店门口，他遇到了巴比·沃伦。她美丽的大眼睛，就像大理石一样，惊讶而好奇地盯着他。 “我以为你在美国，迪克！妮可和你在一起吗？

‘I came back by way of Naples.’
“我是取道那不勒斯回来的。”

The black band on his arm reminded her to say: ‘I’m so sorry to hear of your trouble.’
他手臂上的黑带提醒她说：“听到你的麻烦，我很遗憾。”

Inevitably they dined together.
他们不可避免地一起吃饭。

‘Tell me about everything,’ she demanded.
“告诉我一切，”她要求道。

Dick gave her a version of the facts, and Baby frowned. She found it necessary to blame some one for the catastrophe in her sister’s life.
迪克向她讲述了事实的一个版本，贝比皱起了眉头。她发现有必要将姐姐生活中的灾难归咎于某人。

‘Do you think Doctor Dohmler took the right course with her from the first?’
“你认为多姆勒医生从一开始就对她采取了正确的做法吗？”

‘There’s not much variety in treatment any more—of course you try to find the right personality to handle a particular case.’
“治疗方法不再有太多变化——当然，你会尝试找到合适的人来处理特定的病例。”

‘Dick, I don’t pretend to advise you or to know much about it but don’t you think a change might be good for her—to get out of that atmosphere of sickness and live in the world like other people?’
“迪克，我不会假装给你建议或了解很多，但你不认为改变可能对她有好处吗——摆脱那种疾病的氛围，像其他人一样生活在这个世界上？”

‘But you were keen for the clinic,’ he reminded her. ‘You told me you’d never feel really safe about her—‘
“但你很热衷于诊所，”他提醒她。 “你告诉我你永远不会对她感到真正安全——”

‘That was when you were leading that hermit’s life on the Riviera, up on a hill way off from anybody. I didn’t mean to go back to that life. I meant, for instance, London. The English are the best-balanced race in the world.’
“那时你在里维埃拉过着隐士的生活，在远离任何人的山上。我并不想回到那样的生活。例如，我的意思是伦敦。英国人是世界上最平衡的种族。”

‘They are not,’ he disagreed.
“他们不是，”他不同意。

‘They are. I know them, you see. I meant it might be nice for you to take a house in London for the spring season—I know a dove of a house in Talbot Square you could get, furnished. I mean, living with sane, well-balanced English people.’
'他们是。我认识他们，你看。我的意思是你在伦敦买一套房子过春天可能会很好——我知道你可以在塔尔博特广场买到一栋带家具的房子。我的意思是，和理智、平衡的英国人一起生活。”

She would have gone on to tell him all the old propaganda stories of 1914 if he had not laughed and said:
如果他没有笑着说：

‘I’ve been reading a book by Michael Arlen and if that’s—‘
“我一直在读迈克尔·阿伦的书，如果那是——”

She ruined Michael Arlen with a wave of her salad spoon.
她一挥沙拉勺就毁了迈克尔·阿伦。

‘He only writes about degenerates. I mean the worthwhile English.’
“他只写堕落者。我指的是有价值的英语。

As she thus dismissed her friends they were replaced in Dick’s mind only by a picture of the alien, unresponsive faces that peopled the small hotels of Europe.
当她就此打发朋友们离开时，迪克的脑海中只剩下了一张欧洲小旅馆里那些陌生的、反应迟钝的面孔的照片。

‘Of course it’s none of my business,’ Baby repeated, as a preliminary to a further plunge, ‘but to leave her alone in an atmosphere like that—‘
“当然，这不关我的事，”贝比重复道，作为进一步跳水的准备，“但是让她一个人呆在这样的气氛中——”

‘I went to America because my father died.’
“我去美国是因为我父亲去世了。”

‘I understand that, I told you how sorry I was.’ She fiddled with the glass grapes on her necklace. ‘But there’s so MUCH money now. Plenty for everything, and it ought to be used to get Nicole well.’
“我明白，我告诉过你我有多抱歉。”她摆弄着项链上的玻璃葡萄。 “但是现在有这么多钱。一切都足够了，应该用它来让妮可康复。

‘For one thing I can’t see myself in London.’
“一方面，我在伦敦看不到自己。”

‘Why not? I should think you could work there as well as anywhere else.’
'为什么不？我认为你可以在那里工作，也可以在其他地方工作。”

He sat back and looked at her. If she had ever suspected the rotted old truth, the real reason for Nicole’s illness, she had certainly determined to deny it to herself, shoving it back in a dusty closet like one of the paintings she bought by mistake.
他坐回原处，看着她。如果她曾经怀疑过这个腐烂的旧事实，即妮可生病的真正原因，她肯定会下定决心否认这一点，把它像她误买的一幅画一样塞回满是灰尘的壁橱里。

They continued the conversation in the Ulpia, where Collis Clay came over to their table and sat down, and a gifted guitar player thrummed and rumbled ‘Suona Fanfara Mia’ in the cellar piled with wine casks.
他们在乌尔皮亚继续谈话，科利斯·克莱走到他们的桌子旁坐下，一位才华横溢的吉他手在堆满酒桶的地窖里弹奏着“唢呐范法拉米亚”。

‘It’s possible that I was the wrong person for Nicole,’ Dick said. ‘Still she would probably have married some one of my type, some one she thought she could rely on—indefinitely.’
“我可能不适合妮可，”迪克说。 “不过，她可能会嫁给我这种类型的人，她认为自己可以无限期依赖的人。”

‘You think she’d be happier with somebody else?’ Baby thought aloud suddenly. ‘Of course it could be arranged.’
“你觉得她和别人在一起会更幸福吗？”宝贝突然自言自语道。 “当然可以安排。”

Only as she saw Dick bend forward with helpless laughter did she realize the preposterousness of her remark.
当她看到迪克弯下腰，无奈地笑起来时，她才意识到自己这句话的荒谬。

‘Oh, you understand,’ she assured him. ‘Don’t think for a moment that we’re not grateful for all you’ve done. And we know you’ve had a hard time—‘
“哦，你明白，”她向他保证。 “别以为我们不感激你所做的一切。我们知道你经历了一段艰难的时光——”

‘For God’s sake,’ he protested. ‘If I didn’t love Nicole it might be different.’
“看在上帝的份上，”他抗议道。 “如果我不爱妮可，情况可能会有所不同。”

‘But you do love Nicole?’ she demanded in alarm.
“但你确实爱妮可？”她惊恐地问道。

Collis was catching up with the conversation now and Dick switched it quickly: ‘Suppose we talk about something else—about you, for instance. Why don’t you get married? We heard you were engaged to Lord Paley, the cousin of the—‘
科利斯现在正在跟上谈话，迪克很快就转换了话题：“假设我们谈论一些别的事情——比如关于你。”你为什么不结婚？我们听说你和佩利勋爵订婚了，佩利勋爵是……的表弟

‘Oh, no.’ She became coy and elusive. ‘That was last year.’
“哦，不。”她变得腼腆、难以捉摸。 “那是去年的事了。”

‘Why don’t you marry?’ Dick insisted stubbornly.
“你为什么不结婚？”迪克固执地坚持道。

‘I don’t know. One of the men I loved was killed in the war, and the other one threw me over.’
'我不知道。我所爱的一个人在战争中丧生，另一个人把我扔了下去。

‘Tell me about it. Tell me about your private life, Baby, and your opinions. You never do—we always talk about Nicole.’
'告诉我怎么回事儿。告诉我你的私生活，宝贝，还有你的看法。你永远不会这样做——我们总是谈论妮可。

‘Both of them were Englishmen. I don’t think there’s any higher type in the world than a first-rate Englishman, do you? If there is I haven’t met him. This man—oh, it’s a long story. I hate long stories, don’t you?’
“他们都是英国人。我认为世界上没有比一流的英国人更高尚的人了，你觉得吗？如果有的话我还没见过他。这个人——哦，说来话长。我讨厌长故事，你呢？

‘And how!’ said Collis.
“怎么样！”科利斯说。

‘Why, no—I like them if they’re good.’
“为什么，不——如果它们好的话我就喜欢它们。”

‘That’s something you do so well, Dick. You can keep a party moving by just a little sentence or a saying here and there. I think that’s a wonderful talent.’
“这件事你做得很好，迪克。只需随处的一句话或一句话，就能让聚会继续进行下去。我认为这是一个很棒的天赋。

‘It’s a trick,’ he said gently. That made three of her opinions he disagreed with.
“这是一个诡计，”他温和地说。这使得他不同意她的三个观点。

‘Of course I like formality—I like things to be just so, and on the grand scale. I know you probably don’t but you must admit it’s a sign of solidity in me.’
“我当然喜欢拘谨——我喜欢事情就这样，而且规模宏大。我知道你可能不这么认为，但你必须承认这是我坚强的标志。

Dick did not even bother to dissent from this.
迪克甚至懒得对此提出异议。

‘Of course I know people say, Baby Warren is racing around over Europe, chasing one novelty after another, and missing the best things in life, but I think on the contrary that I’m one of the few people who really go after the best things. I’ve known the most interesting people of my time.’ Her voice blurred with the tinny drumming of another guitar number, but she called over it, ‘I’ve made very few big mistakes—‘
“当然，我知道人们会说，宝贝沃伦正在欧洲各地奔跑，追逐一个又一个新奇事物，错过了生活中最美好的事物，但我认为相反，我是少数几个真正追求新事物的人之一。”最好的事情。我认识了那个时代最有趣的人。”她的声音因另一首吉他曲目的微弱鼓声而变得模糊，但她大声喊道，“我很少犯过大错误——”

‘—Only the very big ones, Baby.’
“——只有很大的，宝贝。”

She had caught something facetious in his eye and she changed the subject. It seemed impossible for them to hold anything in common. But he admired something in her, and he deposited her at the Excelsior with a series of compliments that left her shimmering.
她从他眼中看出了一些滑稽的东西，于是她改变了话题。他们似乎不可能有任何共同点。但他欣赏她身上的某些东西，并把她安置在怡东酒店，并给予了她一系列的赞美，让她容光焕发。

Rosemary insisted on treating Dick to lunch next day. They went to a little trattoria kept by an Italian who had worked in America, and ate ham and eggs and waffles. Afterward, they went to the hotel. Dick’s discovery that he was not in love with her, nor she with him, had added to rather than diminished his passion for her. Now that he knew he would not enter further into her life, she became the strange woman for him. He supposed many men meant no more than that when they said they were in love—not a wild submergence of soul, a dipping of all colors into an obscuring dye, such as his love for Nicole had been. Certain thoughts about Nicole, that she should die, sink into mental darkness, love another man, made him physically sick.
罗斯玛丽坚持第二天请迪克吃午饭。他们去了一个在美国工作过的意大利人开的小餐馆，吃了火腿、鸡蛋和华夫饼。随后，他们前往酒店。迪克发现他不爱她，她也不爱他，这增加了而不是减少了他对她的热情。现在他知道自己不会再深入她的生活了，她对他来说成了陌生的女人。他猜想，很多男人在说自己恋爱时，仅仅意味着这样——不是灵魂的疯狂淹没，不是将所有的色彩都浸入一种模糊的染料中，就像他对妮可的爱那样。关于妮可的某些想法，她应该死，陷入精神黑暗，爱另一个男人，使他身体不适。

Nicotera was in Rosemary’s sitting-room, chattering about a professional matter. When Rosemary gave him his cue to go, he left with humorous protests and a rather insolent wink at Dick. As usual the phone clamored and Rosemary was engaged at it for ten minutes, to Dick’s increasing impatience.
尼科泰拉在罗斯玛丽的客厅里，正在谈论一件专业的事情。当罗斯玛丽暗示他要走时，他带着幽默的抗议离开了，还对迪克相当无礼地眨了眨眼。和往常一样，电话铃声吵闹，罗斯玛丽忙了十分钟，迪克越来越不耐烦。

‘Let’s go up to my room,’ he suggested, and she agreed.
“我们去我的房间吧，”他建议道，她同意了。

She lay across his knees on a big sofa; he ran his fingers through the lovely forelocks of her hair.
她趴在他的膝盖上，躺在一张大沙发上。他用手指梳理着她可爱的额发。

‘Let me be curious about you again?’ he asked.
“让我再次对你感到好奇吗？”他问道。

‘What do you want to know?’
'你想知道什么？'

‘About men. I’m curious, not to say prurient.’
‘关于男人。我很好奇，并不是说好色。”

‘You mean how long after I met you?’
“你是说我认识你之后多久了？”

‘Or before.’
“或者之前。”

‘Oh, no.’ She was shocked. ‘There was nothing before. You were the first man I cared about. You’re still the only man I really care about.’ She considered. ‘It was about a year, I think.’
“哦，不。”她很震惊。 ‘之前什么都没有。你是我第一个关心的男人。你仍然是我唯一真正关心的男人。”她想道。 “我想大约有一年的时间。”

‘Who was it?’
'他是谁？'

‘Oh, a man.’
“哦，一个男人。”

He closed in on her evasion.
他逼近了她的逃避。

‘I’ll bet I can tell you about it: the first affair was unsatisfactory and after that there was a long gap. The second was better, but you hadn’t been in love with the man in the first place. The third was all right—‘
“我敢打赌我可以告诉你：第一段恋情并不令人满意，之后就出现了很长一段时间的差距。第二个更好，但你一开始就没有爱上这个男人。第三个还可以——”

Torturing himself he ran on. ‘Then you had one real affair that fell of its own weight, and by that time you were getting afraid that you wouldn’t have anything to give to the man you finally loved.’ He felt increasingly Victorian. ‘Afterwards there were half a dozen just episodic affairs, right up to the present. Is that close?’
他一边折磨着自己一边继续跑。 “然后你有了一场真正的风流韵事，而这一切却因自身的重量而崩溃，到那时你开始担心自己无法给你最终爱的男人任何东西。”他感觉自己越来越维多利亚时代了。 “后来又发生了六起偶发事件，直到现在。很接近吗？

She laughed between amusement and tears.
她笑得既开心又泪流满面。

‘It’s about as wrong as it could be,’ she said, to Dick’s relief. ‘But some day I’m going to find somebody and love him and love him and never let him go.’
“这完全是错误的，”她说，这让迪克松了一口气。 “但有一天我会找到一个人，爱他，爱他，永远不会让他离开。”

Now his phone rang and Dick recognized Nicotera’s voice, asking for Rosemary. He put his palm over the transmitter.
现在他的电话响了，迪克认出了尼科泰拉的声音，正在找罗斯玛丽。他将手掌放在发射器上。

‘Do you want to talk to him?’
“你想和他谈谈吗？”

She went to the phone and jabbered in a rapid Italian Dick could not understand.
她走到电话跟前，用迪克听不懂的急促的意大利语喋喋不休。

‘This telephoning takes time,’ he said. ‘It’s after four and I have an engagement at five. You better go play with Signor Nicotera.’
“打电话需要时间，”他说。 “现在是四点多了，我五点有约会。你最好去和尼科泰拉先生一起玩。

‘Don’t be silly.’
“别犯傻了。”

‘Then I think that while I’m here you ought to count him out.’
“那么我认为，当我在这里的时候，你应该把他排除在外。”

‘It’s difficult.’ She was suddenly crying. ‘Dick, I do love you, never anybody like you. But what have you got for me?’
“这很难。”她突然哭了。 “迪克，我真的爱你，从来没有像你这样的人。但你有什么给我的吗？

‘What has Nicotera got for anybody?’
“尼科特拉给大家带来了什么？”

‘That’s different.’
'那不一样。'

—Because youth called to youth.
——因为青春召唤着青春。

‘He’s a spic!’ he said. He was frantic with jealousy, he didn’t want to be hurt again.
“他真是个辣妹！”他说。他嫉妒得发狂，他不想再受到伤害。

‘He’s only a baby,’ she said, sniffling. ‘You know I’m yours first.’
“他只是个婴儿，”她吸着鼻子说道。 “你知道我首先是你的。”

In reaction he put his arms about her but she relaxed wearily backward; he held her like that for a moment as in the end of an adagio, her eyes closed, her hair falling straight back like that of a girl drowned.
作为回应，他用双臂搂住了她，但她疲倦地向后放松。他像慢板乐曲的结尾一样抱住了她，她闭着眼睛，头发直垂到脑后，就像一个被淹死的女孩的头发。

‘Dick, let me go. I never felt so mixed up in my life.’
‘迪克，放开我。我一生中从未感到如此混乱。

He was a gruff red bird and instinctively she drew away from him as his unjustified jealousy began to snow over the qualities of consideration and understanding with which she felt at home.
他是一只粗暴的红鸟，当他无端的嫉妒开始覆盖她体贴和理解的品质时，她本能地远离了他。

‘I want to know the truth,’ he said.
“我想知道真相，”他说。

‘Yes, then. We’re a lot together, he wants to marry me, but I don’t want to. What of it? What do you expect me to do? You never asked me to marry you. Do you want me to play around forever with half-wits like Collis Clay?’
是的，那么。我们经常在一起，他想娶我，但我不想。那又怎样呢？你希望我做什么？你从来没有向我求婚。你想让我永远和科利斯·克莱这样的傻瓜一起玩吗？

‘You were with Nicotera last night?’
“昨晚你和尼科泰拉在一起吗？”

‘That’s none of your business,’ she sobbed. ‘Excuse me, Dick, it is your business. You and Mother are the only two people in the world I care about.’
“这不关你的事，”她抽泣道。 “对不起，迪克，这是你的事。你和妈妈是这个世界上我唯一关心的两个人。

‘How about Nicotera?’
“尼科泰拉怎么样？”

‘How do I know?’
'我怎么知道？'

She had achieved the elusiveness that gives hidden significance to the least significant remarks.
她达到了一种难以捉摸的境界，让最不重要的言论也具有了隐藏的意义。

‘Is it like you felt toward me in Paris?’
“这就像你在巴黎对我的感觉吗？”

‘I feel comfortable and happy when I’m with you. In Paris it was different. But you never know how you once felt. Do you?’
‘当我和你在一起时，我感到舒适和快乐。在巴黎，情况有所不同。但你永远不知道你曾经的感受如何。你？'

He got up and began collecting his evening clothes—if he had to bring all the bitterness and hatred of the world into his heart, he was not going to be in love with her again.
他起身，开始收拾晚礼服——如果他要把世间所有的苦涩和仇恨都装进心里，他就不会再爱上她了。

‘I don’t care about Nicotera!’ she declared. ‘But I’ve got to go to Livorno with the company to-morrow. Oh, why did this have to happen?’ There was a new flood of tears. ‘It’s such a shame. Why did you come here? Why couldn’t we just have the memory anyhow? I feel as if I’d quarrelled with Mother.’
“我不在乎尼科特拉！”她宣称。 “但是我明天必须和公司一起去里窝那。噢，为什么会发生这样的事？”又是一阵泪流满面。 ‘真是太遗憾了。你为什么来这里？为什么我们不能拥有记忆呢？我感觉好像我和妈妈吵架了。

As he began to dress, she got up and went to the door.
当他开始穿衣服时，她起身朝门口走去。

‘I won’t go to the party to-night.’ It was her last effort. ‘I’ll stay with you. I don’t want to go anyhow.’
“今晚我不会去参加聚会。”这是她最后的努力。 ‘我会留在你身边。无论如何我不想去。

The tide began to flow again, but he retreated from it.
潮水又开始涌动，但他却退却了。

‘I’ll be in my room,’ she said. ‘Good-by, Dick.’
“我会在我的房间里，”她说。 “再见，迪克。”

‘Good-by.’
'有效期。'

‘Oh, such a shame, such a shame. Oh, such a shame. What’s it all about anyhow?’
‘噢，真是太可惜了，太可惜了。哦，真可惜。到底是怎么回事？

‘I’ve wondered for a long time.’
“我想知道很久了。”

‘But why bring it to me?’
“但是为什么要把它带给我呢？”

‘I guess I’m the Black Death,’ he said slowly. ‘I don’t seem to bring people happiness any more.’
“我想我就是黑死病，”他慢慢地说。 “我似乎不再给人们带来幸福了。”

XXII
二十二

There were five people in the Quirinal bar after dinner, a highclass Italian frail who sat on a stool making persistent conversation against the bartender’s bored: ‘Si ... Si ... Si,’ a light, snobbish Egyptian who was lonely but chary of the woman, and the two Americans.
晚餐后，奎里纳尔酒吧里有五个人，一个意大利高级体弱者坐在凳子上，在酒保无聊的情况下不停地交谈：“Si…Si…Si”，一个轻松、势利的埃及人，孤独但小心谨慎。那个女人和两个美国人。

Dick was always vividly conscious of his surroundings, while Collis Clay lived vaguely, the sharpest impressions dissolving upon a recording apparatus that had early atrophied, so the former talked and the latter listened, like a man sitting in a breeze.
迪克总是对周围的环境有清晰的认识，而科利斯·克莱则生活得模糊，最清晰的印象消解在早已萎缩的录音设备上，所以前者说话，后者倾听，就像一个人坐在微风中。

Dick, worn away by the events of the afternoon, was taking it out on the inhabitants of Italy. He looked around the bar as if he hoped an Italian had heard him and would resent his words.
迪克因下午发生的事情而疲惫不堪，他开始对意大利的居民发脾气。他环顾酒吧四周，仿佛希望有一个意大利人听到了他的话，并对他的话感到不满。

‘This afternoon I had tea with my sister-in-law at the Excelsior. We got the last table and two men came up and looked around for a table and couldn’t find one. So one of them came up to us and said, ‘Isn’t this table reserved for the Princess Orsini?’ and I said: ‘There was no sign on it,’ and he said: ‘But I think it’s reserved for the Princess Orsini.’ I couldn’t even answer him.’
“今天下午我和嫂子在怡东酒店喝茶。我们拿到了最后一张桌子，两个男人走过来四处寻找桌子，但找不到。于是他们中的一个人走过来问我们，“这张桌子不是为奥尔西尼公主预留的吗？”我说：“上面没有任何标志，”他说：“但我认为这是为公主预留的。” “奥尔西尼。”我什至无法回答他。

‘What’d he do?’
“他做了什么？”

‘He retired.’ Dick switched around in his chair. ‘I don’t like these people. The other day I left Rosemary for two minutes in front of a store and an officer started walking up and down in front of her, tipping his hat.’
“他退休了。”迪克在椅子上转了个身。 ‘我不喜欢这些人。有一天，我把罗斯玛丽留在一家商店门前待了两分钟，一名警官开始在她面前走来走去，还向她倾斜了帽子。

‘I don’t know,’ said Collis after a moment. ‘I’d rather be here than up in Paris with somebody picking your pocket every minute.’
“我不知道，”过了一会儿，科利斯说道。 “我宁愿在这里，也不愿在巴黎每分钟都有人扒你的口袋。”

He had been enjoying himself, and he held out against anything that threatened to dull his pleasure.
他一直很享受，并且他抵制任何可能削弱他快乐的事情。

‘I don’t know,’ he persisted. ‘I don’t mind it here.’
“我不知道，”他坚持道。 “我不介意这里。”

Dick evoked the picture that the few days had imprinted on his mind, and stared at it. The walk toward the American Express past the odorous confectioneries of the Via Nationale, through the foul tunnel up to the Spanish Steps, where his spirit soared before the flower stalls and the house where Keats had died. He cared only about people; he was scarcely conscious of places except for their weather, until they had been invested with color by tangible events. Rome was the end of his dream of Rosemary.
迪克唤起了这几天印在脑海里的画面，凝视着它。走向美国运通公司的路上，经过国家大道上散发着气味的糖果店，穿过肮脏的隧道，到达西班牙阶梯，他的精神在花摊和济慈去世的房子前翱翔。他只关心人；除了天气之外，他几乎不知道其他地方，直到这些地方被有形的事件赋予了色彩。罗马是他迷迭香梦想的终结。

A bell-boy came in and gave him a note.
一个服务员进来给了他一张纸条。

‘I did not go to the party,’ it said. ‘I am in my room. We leave for Livorno early in the morning.’
“我没有去参加聚会，”它说。 '我在我的房间里。我们一早就出发去里窝那。

Dick handed the note and a tip to the boy.
迪克把纸条和小费递给男孩。

‘Tell Miss Hoyt you couldn’t find me.’ Turning to Collis he suggested the Bonbonieri.
“告诉霍伊特小姐你找不到我。”他转向科利斯，建议去 Bonbonieri。

They inspected the tart at the bar, granting her the minimum of interest exacted by her profession, and she stared back with bright boldness; they went through the deserted lobby oppressed by draperies holding Victorian dust in stuffy folds, and they nodded at the night concierge who returned the gesture with the bitter servility peculiar to night servants. Then in a taxi they rode along cheerless streets through a dank November night. There were no women in the streets, only pale men with dark coats buttoned to the neck, who stood in groups beside shoulders of cold stone.
他们在酒吧里检查了馅饼，给予了她职业所要求的最低限度的兴趣，而她则以明亮的大胆目光回望着她。他们穿过空荡荡的大厅，窗帘压着维多利亚时代的灰尘，在闷热的褶皱中，他们向夜间门房点点头，后者以夜间仆人特有的苦涩的奴性回应了这个手势。然后，他们乘坐出租车沿着阴冷的街道行驶，度过了十一月潮湿的夜晚。街上没有女人，只有脸色苍白的男人，深色外套的扣子扣到脖子上，三五成群地站在冰冷的石头肩膀旁。

‘My God!’ Dick sighed.
“天哪！”迪克叹了口气。

‘What’s a matter?’
“有什么事吗？”

‘I was thinking of that man this afternoon: ‘This table is reserved for the Princess Orsini.’ Do you know what these old Roman families are? They’re bandits, they’re the ones who got possession of the temples and palaces after Rome went to pieces and preyed on the people.’
“今天下午我想起了那个人：‘这张桌子是为奥尔西尼公主保留的。’你知道这些古老的罗马家族是什么吗？他们是强盗，是罗马崩溃后占领寺庙和宫殿并掠夺人民的人。

‘I like Rome,’ insisted Collis. ‘Why won’t you try the races?’
“我喜欢罗马，”科利斯坚持说。 “你为什么不尝试一下比赛呢？”

‘I don’t like races.’
“我不喜欢比赛。”

‘But all the women turn out—‘
“但是所有的女人最后都——”

‘I know I wouldn’t like anything here. I like France, where everybody thinks he’s Napoleon—down here everybody thinks he’s Christ.’
“我知道我不会喜欢这里的任何东西。我喜欢法国，那里的每个人都认为他是拿破仑，而这里的每个人都认为他是基督。

At the Bonbonieri they descended to a panelled cabaret, hopelessly impermanent amid the cold stone. A listless band played a tango and a dozen couples covered the wide floor with those elaborate and dainty steps so offensive to the American eye. A surplus of waiters precluded the stir and bustle that even a few busy men can create; over the scene as its form of animation brooded an air of waiting for something, for the dance, the night, the balance of forces which kept it stable, to cease. It assured the impressionable guest that whatever he was seeking he would not find it here.
在 Bonbonieri，他们来到了一家镶有镶板的歌舞厅，在冰冷的石头中，它无可救药地转瞬即逝。一支无精打采的乐队演奏着探戈，十几对情侣在宽阔的地板上表演着那些精致而精致的舞步，这些舞步在美国人看来非常冒犯。服务员过多，避免了即使是几个大忙​​人也能造成的喧闹。整个场景笼罩着一种等待某种事物的气氛，等待着舞蹈、夜晚以及维持其稳定的力量平衡的停止。它向易受影响的客人保证，无论他想要什么，他都不会在这里找到。

This was plain as plain to Dick. He looked around, hoping his eye would catch on something, so that spirit instead of imagination could carry on for an hour. But there was nothing and after a moment he turned back to Collis. He had told Collis some of his current notions, and he was bored with his audience’s short memory and lack of response. After half an hour of Collis he felt a distinct lesion of his own vitality.
这对迪克来说再简单不过了。他环顾四周，希望自己的眼睛能看到什么，这样精神而不是想象就能持续一个小时。但什么也没有发生，过了一会儿他又转向科利斯。他已经告诉了科利斯他目前的一些想法，他对观众的记忆力差和缺乏反应感到厌倦。科利斯半小时后，他感觉到自己的活力明显受损。

They drank a bottle of Italian mousseaux, and Dick became pale and somewhat noisy. He called the orchestra leader over to their table; this was a Bahama Negro, conceited and unpleasant, and in a few minutes there was a row.
他们喝了一瓶意大利慕斯，迪克脸色苍白，有些吵闹。他把乐团指挥叫到他们的桌子旁。这是一个巴哈马黑人，自负又令人讨厌，几分钟后就发生了争吵。

‘You asked me to sit down.’
“你让我坐下。”

‘All right. And I gave you fifty lire, didn’t I?’
'好的。我给了你五十里拉，不是吗？

‘All right. All right. All right.’
'好的。好的。好的。'

‘All right, I gave you fifty lire, didn’t I? Then you come up and asked me to put some more in the horn!’
“好吧，我给了你五十里拉，不是吗？然后你上来要求我在喇叭里再放一些！

‘You asked me to sit down, didn’t you? Didn’t you?’
‘你叫我坐下，是吗？你不是吗？

‘I asked you to sit down but I gave you fifty lire, didn’t I?’
“我请你坐下，但我给了你五十里拉，不是吗？”

‘All right. All right.’
'好的。好的。'

The Negro got up sourly and went away, leaving Dick in a still more evil humor. But he saw a girl smiling at him from across the room and immediately the pale Roman shapes around him receded into decent, humble perspective. She was a young English girl, with blonde hair and a healthy, pretty English face and she smiled at him again with an invitation he understood, that denied the flesh even in the act of tendering it.
黑人酸溜溜地站起来走开了，留下迪克的心情更加邪恶。但他看到一个女孩在房间的另一边对他微笑，他周围苍白的罗马人影立即退入正派、谦逊的视野。她是一个年轻的英国女孩，一头金发，有着一张健康、漂亮的英国脸，她再次对他微笑，带着他理解的邀请，即使在温柔的行为中，她也否认了肉体。

‘There’s a quick trick or else I don’t know bridge,’ said Collis.
“有一个快速技巧，否则我就不懂桥牌了，”科利斯说。

Dick got up and walked to her across the room.
迪克站起来，穿过房间朝她走去。

‘Won’t you dance?’
“你不跳舞吗？”

The middle-aged Englishman with whom she was sitting said, almost apologetically: ‘I’m going out soon.’
与她坐在一起的那位中年英国人几乎带着歉意地说：“我很快就要出去了。”

Sobered by excitement Dick danced. He found in the girl a suggestion of all the pleasant English things; the story of safe gardens ringed around by the sea was implicit in her bright voice and as he leaned back to look at her, he meant what he said to her so sincerely that his voice trembled. When her current escort should leave, she promised to come and sit with them. The Englishman accepted her return with repeated apologies and smiles.
迪克因兴奋而清醒过来，跳起舞来。他在这个女孩身上发现了所有令人愉快的英国事物的暗示。大海环绕的安全花园的故事隐含在她明亮的声音中，当他靠在椅背上看着她时，他对她说的话是如此真诚，以至于他的声音都在颤抖。当她现在的护卫离开时，她答应会过来和他们坐在一起。英国人一再道歉并微笑着接受了她的归来。

Back at his table Dick ordered another bottle of spumante.
回到餐桌前，迪克又要了一瓶起泡酒。

‘She looks like somebody in the movies,’ he said. ‘I can’t think who.’ He glanced impatiently over his shoulder. ‘Wonder what’s keeping her?’
“她看起来就像电影里的人物，”他说。 “我想不出是谁。”他不耐烦地回头看了一眼。 “想知道是什么让她受不了？”

‘I’d like to get in the movies,’ said Collis thoughtfully. ‘I’m supposed to go into my father’s business but it doesn’t appeal to me much. Sit in an office in Birmingham for twenty years—‘
“我想看电影，”科利斯若有所思地说。 “我本来应该从事我父亲的生意，但它对我没有多大吸引力。在伯明翰的一间办公室里坐了二十年——”

His voice resisted the pressure of materialistic civilization.
他的声音抵抗着物质文明的压力。

‘Too good for it?’ suggested Dick.
“太好了？”迪克建议道。

‘No, I don’t mean that.’
“不，我不是那个意思。”

‘Yes, you do.’
'是的你是。'

‘How do you know what I mean? Why don’t you practise as a doctor, if you like to work so much?’
‘你怎么知道我的意思？如果你这么喜欢工作，为什么不去当一名医生呢？

Dick had made them both wretched by this time, but simultaneously they had become vague with drink and in a moment they forgot; Collis left, and they shook hands warmly.
迪克此时已经让他们俩都变得很可怜了，但同时他们也因为喝醉了而变得模糊，很快他们就忘记了；科利斯离开后，他们热情地握手。

‘Think it over,’ said Dick sagely.
“想一想，”迪克明智地说。

‘Think what over?’
“想一想怎么办？”

‘You know.’ It had been something about Collis going into his father’s business—good sound advice.
“你知道。”这与科利斯进入他父亲的生意有关——这是一个很好的建议。

Clay walked off into space. Dick finished his bottle and then danced with the English girl again, conquering his unwilling body with bold revolutions and stern determined marches down the floor. The most remarkable thing suddenly happened. He was dancing with the girl, the music stopped—and she had disappeared.
克莱走进了太空。迪克喝完这瓶酒，然后再次与英国女孩跳舞，用大胆的旋转和坚定的步伐在地板上征服了他不情愿的身体。最引人注目的事情突然发生了。他正在和女孩跳舞，音乐停止了——她消失了。

‘Have you seen her?’
'你有看见她吗？'

‘Seen who?’
“看到谁了？”

‘The girl I was dancing with. Su’nly disappeared. Must be in the building.’
‘和我跳舞的那个女孩。苏就消失了。一定在大楼里。”

‘No! No! That’s the ladies’ room.’
'不！不！那是女洗手间。”

He stood up by the bar. There were two other men there, but he could think of no way of starting a conversation. He could have told them all about Rome and the violent origins of the Colonna and Gaetani families but he realized that as a beginning that would be somewhat abrupt. A row of Yenci dolls on the cigar counter fell suddenly to the floor; there was a subsequent confusion and he had a sense of having been the cause of it, so he went back to the cabaret and drank a cup of black coffee. Collis was gone and the English girl was gone and there seemed nothing to do but go back to the hotel and lie down with his black heart. He paid his check and got his hat and coat.
他在吧台边站了起来。那里还有另外两个人，但他想不出如何开始谈话。他本可以告诉他们所有关于罗马以及科隆纳和盖塔尼家族的暴力起源的事情，但他意识到作为一个开始有点唐突。雪茄柜台上的一排延吉娃娃突然掉到了地上；随后出现了混乱，他有一种感觉，这就是造成这一切的原因，所以他回到歌舞厅喝了一杯黑咖啡。科利斯走了，英国女孩也走了，似乎没有什么可做的，只能回到旅馆，带着他那颗黑色的心躺下。他付了支票，拿到了帽子和外套。

There was dirty water in the gutters and between the rough cobblestones; a marshy vapor from the Campagna, a sweat of exhausted cultures tainted the morning air. A quartet of taxidrivers, their little eyes bobbing in dark pouches, surrounded him. One who leaned insistently in his face he pushed harshly away.
排水沟里和粗糙的鹅卵石之间都有脏水；来自平原的沼泽蒸气，疲惫的文化的汗水污染了早晨的空气。四个出租车司机围住了他，他们的小眼睛在黑色的眼袋里不停地转动。一个坚持靠在他脸上的人被他粗暴地推开。

‘Quanto a Hotel Quirinal?’
“Quanto 奎里纳尔酒店？”

‘Cento lire.’
“琴托里拉。”

Six dollars. He shook his head and offered thirty lire which was twice the day-time fare, but they shrugged their shoulders as one pair, and moved off.
六美元。他摇摇头，给出了三十里拉，这是白天票价的两倍，但他们耸了耸肩，走开了。

‘Trente-cinque lire e mancie,’ he said firmly.
“Trente-cinque lire e mancie，”他坚定地说。

‘Cento lire.’
“琴托里拉。”

He broke into English.
他突然开始说英语。

‘To go half a mile? You’ll take me for forty lire.’
‘走半英里？你花四十里拉就可以收下我。

‘Oh, no.’
'不好了。'

He was very tired. He pulled open the door of a cab and got in.
他很累。他拉开一辆出租车的车门，坐了进去。

‘Hotel Quirinal!’ he said to the driver who stood obstinately outside the window. ‘Wipe that sneer off your face and take me to the Quirinal.’
“奎里纳尔酒店！”他对固执地站在窗外的司机说道。 “擦掉你脸上的冷笑，带我去奎里纳尔。”

‘Ah, no.’
“啊，不。”

Dick got out. By the door of the Bonbonieri some one was arguing with the taxi-drivers, some one who now tried to explain their attitude to Dick; again one of the men pressed close, insisting and gesticulating and Dick shoved him away.
迪克下了车。在 Bonbonieri 的门口，有人正在与出租车司机争吵，有人试图向迪克解释他们的态度；但他们的态度并不好。其中一名男子再次逼近，一边坚持一边打手势，迪克把他推开了。

‘I want to go to the Quirinal Hotel.’
“我想去奎里纳尔酒店。”

‘He says wan huner lire,’ explained the interpreter.
“他说万胡纳里拉，”翻译解释道。

‘I understand. I’ll give him fif’y lire. Go on away.’ This last to the insistent man who had edged up once more. The man looked at him and spat contemptuously.
'我明白。我会给他五里拉。继续走吧。”这是对再次崛起的坚持不懈的人的最后一句话。男人看了他一眼，轻蔑地吐了一口口水。

The passionate impatience of the week leaped up in Dick and clothed itself like a flash in violence, the honorable, the traditional resource of his land; he stepped forward and slapped the man’s face.
这周的强烈不耐烦在迪克心中跃起，并像暴力的一闪而过，这是他的土地上光荣的传统资源；他上前，打了那人的脸一巴掌。

They surged about him, threatening, waving their arms, trying ineffectually to close in on him—with his back against the wall Dick hit out clumsily, laughing a little and for a few minutes the mock fight, an affair of foiled rushes and padded, glancing blows, swayed back and forth in front of the door. Then Dick tripped and fell; he was hurt somewhere but he struggled up again wrestling in arms that suddenly broke apart. There was a new voice and a new argument but he leaned against the wall, panting and furious at the indignity of his position. He saw there was no sympathy for him but he was unable to believe that he was wrong.
他们在他周围涌来，威胁着，挥舞着手臂，徒劳地试图接近他——背靠在墙上，迪克笨拙地出击，笑了一会儿，有几分钟的模拟战斗，一场挫败的冲刺和衬垫的事件，扫视一眼，在门前晃来晃去。然后迪克被绊倒了。他某处受伤了，但他又挣扎着爬起来，双臂突然断裂。出现了新的声音和新的争论，但他靠在墙上，气喘吁吁，对自己立场的侮辱感到愤怒。他看到没有人同情他，但他无法相信自己错了。

They were going to the police station and settle it there. His hat was retrieved and handed to him, and with some one holding his arm lightly he strode around the corner with the taxi-men and entered a bare barrack where carabinieri lounged under a single dim light.
他们要去警察局解决问题。他的帽子被取了出来，递给了他，有人轻轻地握住了他的手臂，他和出租车司机一起大步绕过拐角，进入了一个空荡荡的营房，宪兵队在昏暗的灯光下休息。

At a desk sat a captain, to whom the officious individual who had stopped the battle spoke at length in Italian, at times pointing at Dick, and letting himself be interrupted by the taxi-men who delivered short bursts of invective and denunciation. The captain began to nod impatiently. He held up his hand and the hydra-headed address, with a few parting exclamations, died away. Then he turned to Dick.
桌子旁坐着一位上尉，那个制止了战斗的好管闲事的人用意大利语对他进行了详细的交谈，有时指着迪克，并让出租车司机打断了他的讲话，他们发出了短促的谩骂和谴责。船长开始不耐烦地点点头。他举起手，九头蛇头的演讲，伴随着几声临别感叹，渐渐消失。然后他转向迪克。

‘Spick Italiano?’ he asked.
“Spick Italiano？”他问道。

‘No.’
'不。'

‘Spick Français?’
“法国人？”

‘Oui,’ said Dick, glowering.
“哎哟，”迪克怒视着说道。

‘Alors. Écoute. Va au Quirinal. Espèce d’endormi. Écoute: vous êtes saoûl. Payez ce que le chauffeur demande. Comprenez-vous?’
‘阿洛斯。埃库特。瓦奥奎里纳尔。 Espèce d'endormi。 Écoute：vous êtes saoûl。请支付司机的费用。你懂吗？

Diver shook his head.
潜水员摇摇头。

‘Non, je ne veux pas.’
“不，我不想。”

‘COME?’
'来？'

‘Je paierai quarante lires. C’est bien assez.’
‘Je paierai quarante 里拉。这是最好的。”

The captain stood up.
船长站了起来。

‘Écoute!’ he cried portentously. ‘Vous êtes saoûl. Vous avez battu le chauffeur. Comme ci, comme ça.’ He struck the air excitedly with right hand and left, ‘C’est bon que je vous donne la liberté. Payez ce qu’il a dit—cento lire. Va au Quirinal.’
“Écoute！”他凶狠地喊道。 “Vous êtes saoûl”。你是司机。 Comme ci，comme ça。”他兴奋地用右手和左手敲击空气，“C’est bon que je vous donne la liberté。 Payez ce qu'il a dit—cento 里拉。 Va au Quirinal。’

Raging with humiliation, Dick stared back at him.
迪克因羞辱而怒火中烧，回瞪着他。

‘All right.’ He turned blindly to the door—before him, leering and nodding, was the man who had brought him to the police station. ‘I’ll go home,’ he shouted, ‘but first I’ll fix this baby.’
“好吧。”他盲目地转向门口——在他面前，那个把他带到警察局的人，斜视着，点点头。 “我要回家了，”他喊道，“但首先我要治好这个孩子。”

He walked past the staring carabinieri and up to the grinning face, hit it with a smashing left beside the jaw. The man dropped to the floor.
他走过那张瞪着眼睛的宪兵，走到那张咧着嘴笑的脸前，用左拳猛击它的下巴。那人倒在地上。

For a moment he stood over him in savage triumph—but even as a first pang of doubt shot through him the world reeled; he was clubbed down, and fists and boots beat on him in a savage tattoo. He felt his nose break like a shingle and his eyes jerk as if they had snapped back on a rubber band into his head. A rib splintered under a stamping heel. Momentarily he lost consciousness, regained it as he was raised to a sitting position and his wrists jerked together with handcuffs. He struggled automatically. The plainclothes lieutenant whom he had knocked down, stood dabbing his jaw with a handkerchief and looking into it for blood; he came over to Dick, poised himself, drew back his arm and smashed him to the floor.
有那么一会儿，他带着狂野的胜利站在他面前——但当他第一次感到怀疑时，整个世界都摇摇欲坠了。他被棍棒打倒，拳头和靴子敲打在他身上，留下了野蛮的纹身。他感觉自己的鼻子像木瓦一样碎了，眼睛猛地抽动，好像用橡皮筋弹回了他的脑袋。一根肋骨在脚后跟的踩踏下裂开了。他一时失去了知觉，但当他被抬到坐姿时，他的手腕被手铐猛地扣住，他才恢复知觉。他不自觉地挣扎。被他打倒的便衣中尉站在那里，用手帕擦着下巴，检查里面是否有血。他走到迪克身边，摆好姿势，收回手臂，把他摔倒在地。

When Doctor Diver lay quite still a pail of water was sloshed over him. One of his eyes opened dimly as he was being dragged along by the wrists through a bloody haze and he made out the human and ghastly face of one of the taxi-drivers.
当戴弗医生一动不动地躺着时，一桶水泼到了他身上。当他的手腕被拖着穿过血腥的薄雾时，他的一只眼睛朦胧地睁开，他辨认出其中一名出租车司机的人性而可怕的脸。

‘Go to the Excelsior hotel,’ he cried faintly. ‘Tell Miss Warren. Two hundred lire! Miss Warren. Due centi lire! Oh, you dirty— you God—‘
“去怡东酒店，”他微弱地喊道。 “告诉沃伦小姐。两百里拉！沃伦小姐。百分之里拉！哦，你这个肮脏的——你上帝——”

Still he was dragged along through the bloody haze, choking and sobbing, over vague irregular surfaces into some small place where he was dropped upon a stone floor. The men went out, a door clanged, he was alone.
但他仍然被拖着穿过血腥的烟雾，窒息和抽泣，穿过模糊不规则的表面，进入某个小地方，然后被扔到石头地板上。男人们出去了，门叮当作响，只剩下他一个人。

第二十三

Until one o’clock Baby Warren lay in bed, reading one of Marion Crawford’s curiously inanimate Roman stories; then she went to a window and looked down into the street. Across from the hotel two carabinieri, grotesque in swaddling capes and harlequin hats, swung voluminously from this side and that, like mains’ls coming about, and watching them she thought of the guards’ officer who had stared at her so intensely at lunch. He had possessed the arrogance of a tall member of a short race, with no obligation save to be tall. Had he come up to her and said: ‘Let’s go along, you and I,’ she would have answered: ‘Why not?’—at least it seemed so now, for she was still disembodied by an unfamiliar background.
直到一点钟，沃伦宝宝才躺在床上，读着玛丽昂·克劳福德的一本奇怪的无生命的罗马故事。然后她走到窗前，俯视街道。酒店对面有两个宪兵，穿着襁褓中的斗篷，戴着丑角帽，样子奇形怪状，左右摇摆，就像电源即将到来一样，看着他们，她想起了午餐时紧紧盯着她的警卫军官。他拥有短跑比赛中高个子成员的傲慢，除了长得高之外没有任何义务。如果他走到她面前说：“我们一起走吧，你和我，”她会回答：“为什么不呢？”——至少现在看来是这样，因为陌生的背景仍然让她心不在焉。

Her thoughts drifted back slowly through the guardsman to the two carabinieri, to Dick—she got into bed and turned out the light.
她的思绪慢慢地穿过警卫，回到两个宪兵，回到迪克——她上了床，关了灯。

A little before four she was awakened by a brusque knocking.
快四点的时候，她被一阵粗鲁的敲门声惊醒。

‘Yes—what is it?’
'是的，这是什么？'

‘It’s the concierge, Madame.’
“是礼宾部，女士。”

She pulled on her kimono and faced him sleepily.
她穿上和服，睡眼惺忪地面对着他。

‘Your friend name Deever he’s in trouble. He had trouble with the police, and they have him in the jail. He sent a taxi up to tell, the driver says that he promised him two hundred lire.’ He paused cautiously for this to be approved. ‘The driver says Mr. Deever in the bad trouble. He had a fight with the police and is terribly bad hurt.’
“你的朋友名叫迪弗，他有麻烦了。”他与警察发生了麻烦，他们把他关进了监狱。他派了一辆出租车过来通知，司机说他答应给他两百里拉。”他小心翼翼地停了下来，等待批准。 “司机说迪弗先生遇到了大麻烦。他与警察发生了争执，受了重伤。”

‘I’ll be right down.’
“我马上下来。”

She dressed to an accompaniment of anxious heartbeats and ten minutes later stepped out of the elevator into the dark lobby. The chauffeur who brought the message was gone; the concierge hailed another one and told him the location of the jail. As they rode, the darkness lifted and thinned outside and Baby’s nerves, scarcely awake, cringed faintly at the unstable balance between night and day. She began to race against the day; sometimes on the broad avenues she gained but whenever the thing that was pushing up paused for a moment, gusts of wind blew here and there impatiently and the slow creep of light began once more. The cab went past a loud fountain splashing in a voluminous shadow, turned into an alley so curved that the buildings were warped and strained following it, bumped and rattled over cobblestones, and stopped with a jerk where two sentry boxes were bright against a wall of green damp. Suddenly from the violet darkness of an archway came Dick’s voice, shouting and screaming.
她在焦急的心跳声中穿好衣服，十分钟后走出电梯，走进黑暗的大厅。带来消息的司机已经走了；门房招呼另一名男子，并告诉他监狱的位置。当他们骑马的时候，外面的黑暗升起并变得稀薄，婴儿的神经几乎没有醒来，因昼夜之间不稳定的平衡而微微畏缩。她开始与日子赛跑。有时在她到达的宽阔大道上，但每当那推起的东西停下来时，阵阵风就不耐烦地吹来吹去，光线再次开始缓慢蠕动。出租车驶过一个在巨大的阴影中溅起水花的巨大喷泉，拐进一条小巷，小巷如此弯曲，以至于后面的建筑物都扭曲变形，在鹅卵石上颠簸、嘎嘎作响，然后猛地停了下来，两个岗亭在墙壁上闪闪发光。绿色潮湿。突然，从拱门紫罗兰色的黑暗中传来迪克的声音，喊叫着、尖叫着。

‘Are there any English? Are there any Americans? Are there any English? Are there any—oh, my God! You dirty Wops!’
‘有英文的吗？有美国人吗？有英文的吗？有没有——哦，天哪！你这个肮脏的沃普！

His voice died away and she heard a dull sound of beating on the door. Then the voice began again.
他的声音渐渐消失，她听见一阵沉闷的敲门声。然后声音又开始了。

‘Are there any Americans? Are there any English?’
‘有美国人吗？有英文吗？

Following the voice she ran through the arch into a court, whirled about in momentary confusion and located the small guard-room whence the cries came. Two carabinieri started to their feet, but Baby brushed past them to the door of the cell.
她循着声音跑过拱门，跑进了庭院，在短暂的混乱中转了一圈，找到了叫喊声传来的小警卫室。两名宪兵站了起来，但贝比从他们身边擦身而过，来到牢房门口。

‘Dick!’ she called. ‘What’s the trouble?’
“迪克！”她喊道。 “有什么麻烦吗？”

‘They’ve put out my eye,’ he cried. ‘They handcuffed me and then they beat me, the goddamn—the—‘
“他们挖出了我的眼睛，”他喊道。 “他们给我戴上手铐，然后殴打我，该死的——这个——”

Flashing around Baby took a step toward the two carabinieri.
贝比一闪身，朝两名宪兵迈出了一步。

‘What have you done to him?’ she whispered so fiercely that they flinched before her gathering fury.
“你对他做了什么？”她低声说道，声音如此凶猛，以至于他们在她愈演愈烈的愤怒面前退缩了。

‘Non capisco inglese.’
“非卡皮斯科英语。”

In French she execrated them; her wild, confident rage filled the room, enveloped them until they shrank and wriggled from the garments of blame with which she invested them. ‘Do something! Do something!’
她用法语咒骂他们；她狂野而自信的愤怒充满了整个房间，笼罩着他们，直到他们从她赋予他们的责备外衣中退缩并蠕动。 '做一点事！做一点事！'

‘We can do nothing until we are ordered.’
“在接到命令之前我们什么也做不了。”

‘Bene. BAY-NAY! BENE!’
‘贝尼。反对！贝尼！

Once more Baby let her passion scorch around them until they sweated out apologies for their impotence, looking at each other with the sense that something had after all gone terribly wrong. Baby went to the cell door, leaned against it, almost caressing it, as if that could make Dick feel her presence and power, and cried: ‘I’m going to the Embassy, I’ll be back.’ Throwing a last glance of infinite menace at the carabinieri she ran out.
宝贝再一次让她的激情在他们周围燃烧，直到他们为自己的无能而流汗，互相看着对方，感觉毕竟出了什么问题。贝比走到牢房门口，靠在门上，几乎是在爱抚它，仿佛这样可以让迪克感受到她的存在和力量，然后喊道：“我要去大使馆，我会回来的。”最后看了一眼。她跑出了宪兵队的无限威胁。

She drove to the American Embassy where she paid off the taxidriver upon his insistence. It was still dark when she ran up the steps and pressed the bell. She had pressed it three times before a sleepy English porter opened the door to her.
她开车去了美国大使馆，在出租车司机的坚持下，她付了钱。当她跑上台阶按下门铃时，天还黑着。她按了三下门，一个昏昏欲睡的英国搬运工才给她开门。

‘I want to see some one,’ she said. ‘Any one—but right away.’
“我想见一个人，”她说。 “任何人都可以——但是马上。”

‘No one’s awake, Madame. We don’t open until nine o’clock.’
“没人醒，夫人。我们要到九点才开门。”

Impatiently she waved the hour away.
她不耐烦地挥手示意时间过去了。

‘This is important. A man—an American has been terribly beaten. He’s in an Italian jail.’
'这个很重要。一个人——一个美国人被严重殴打了。他在意大利监狱里。”

‘No one’s awake now. At nine o’clock—‘
‘现在没人醒了。九点钟-'

‘I can’t wait. They’ve put out a man’s eye—my brother-in-law, and they won’t let him out of jail. I must talk to some one—can’t you see? Are you crazy? Are you an idiot, you stand there with that look in your face?’
“我等不及了。他们挖出了一个人的眼睛——我的姐夫，他们不让他出狱。我必须找个人谈谈——你明白吗？你疯了？你是个白痴吗，你站在那里，脸上露出那种表情？

‘Hime unable to do anything, Madame.’
“夫人，他无能为力。”

‘You’ve got to wake some one up!’ She seized him by the shoulders and jerked him violently. ‘It’s a matter of life and death. If you won’t wake some one a terrible thing will happen to you—‘
“你必须叫醒一个人！”她抓住他的肩膀，用力地猛拉他。 ‘这是生死攸关的问题。如果你不叫醒某人，一件可怕的事情就会发生在你身上——”

‘Kindly don’t lay hands on me, Madame.’
“请不要对我下手，女士。”

From above and behind the porter floated down a weary Groton voice.
搬运工的上方和后方传来格罗顿疲惫的声音。

‘What is it there?’
“那儿是什么？”

The porter answered with relief.
搬运工松了一口气。

‘It’s a lady, sir, and she has shook me.’ He had stepped back to speak and Baby pushed forward into the hall. On an upper landing, just aroused from sleep and wrapped in a white embroidered Persian robe, stood a singular young man. His face was of a monstrous and unnatural pink, vivid yet dead, and over his mouth was fastened what appeared to be a gag. When he saw Baby he moved his head back into a shadow.
“这是一位女士，先生，她让我很震惊。”他退后一步说话，宝贝推着进了大厅。楼上的平台上，站着一个刚刚从睡梦中醒来、身穿白色绣花波斯长袍的奇特年轻人。他的脸呈怪异而不自然的粉红色，生动却又死气沉沉，嘴上塞着一个似乎是堵嘴的东西。当他看到宝贝时，他把头移回阴影中。

‘What is it?’ he repeated.
“那是什么？”他重复道。

Baby told him, in her agitation edging forward to the stairs. In the course of her story she realized that the gag was in reality a mustache bandage and that the man’s face was covered with pink cold cream, but the fact fitted quietly into the nightmare. The thing to do, she cried passionately, was for him to come to the jail with her at once and get Dick out.
宝贝一边激动地一边向楼梯走去，一边告诉他。在讲述故事的过程中，她意识到这个堵嘴实际上是一条胡子绷带，而那个男人的脸上涂满了粉红色的冷霜，但事实却悄然融入了噩梦。她激动地喊道，要做的事情就是让他立即和她一起去监狱，把迪克救出来。

‘It’s a bad business,’ he said.
“这生意很糟糕，”他说。

‘Yes,’ she agreed conciliatingly. ‘Yes?’
“是的，”她安抚地同意。 '是的？'

‘This trying to fight the police.’ A note of personal affront crept into his voice, ‘I’m afraid there’s nothing to be done until nine o’clock.’
“这是想与警察对抗。”他的声音里带着一丝侮辱，“恐怕九点之前都无事可做。”

‘Till nine o’clock,’ she repeated aghast. ‘But you can do something, certainly! You can come to the jail with me and see that they don’t hurt him any more.’
“直到九点。”她惊愕地重复道。 “但是你当然可以做点什么！你可以和我一起去监狱看看他们不再伤害他了。

‘We aren’t permitted to do anything like that. The Consulate handles these things. The Consulate will be open at nine.’
‘我们不被允许做那样的事情。这些事情都是领事馆处理的。领事馆将于九点开放。

His face, constrained to impassivity by the binding strap, infuriated Baby.
他的脸被绑带束缚得面无表情，这激怒了贝比。

‘I can’t wait until nine. My brother-in-law says they’ve put his eye out—he’s seriously hurt! I have to get to him. I have to find a doctor.’ She let herself go and began to cry angrily as she talked, for she knew that he would respond to her agitation rather than her words. ‘You’ve got to do something about this. It’s your business to protect American citizens in trouble.’
“我等不及九点了。我姐夫说他们把他的眼睛挖出来了——他伤得很重！我必须去找他。我得找医生。”她放开自己，边说边开始愤怒地哭泣，因为她知道他会回应她的激动，而不是她的话。 ‘你必须为此做点什么。保护陷入困境的美国公民是你们的职责。”

But he was of the Eastern seaboard and too hard for her. Shaking his head patiently at her failure to understand his position he drew the Persian robe closer about him and came down a few steps.
但他是东海岸人，对她来说太难了。由于她无法理解他的立场，他耐心地摇了摇头，他把波斯长袍拉得更紧，然后下了几步。

‘Write down the address of the Consulate for this lady,’ he said to the porter, ‘and look up Doctor Colazzo’s address and telephone number and write that down too.’ He turned to Baby, with the expression of an exasperated Christ. ‘My dear lady, the diplomatic corps represents the Government of the United States to the Government of Italy. It has nothing to do with the protection of citizens, except under specific instructions from the State Department. Your brother-in-law has broken the laws of this country and been put in jail, just as an Italian might be put in jail in New York. The only people who can let him go are the Italian courts and if your brother-in-law has a case you can get aid and advice from the Consulate, which protects the rights of American citizens. The consulate does not open until nine o’clock. Even if it were my brother I couldn’t do anything—‘
“写下这位女士领事馆的地址，”他对门房说，“查一下科拉佐医生的地址和电话号码，也写下来。”他转向贝比，脸上带着愤怒的基督表情。 “亲爱的女士，外交使团在意大利政府面前代表美国政府。除非国务院有具体指示，否则它与保护公民无关。你的姐夫违反了这个国家的法律并被关进监狱，就像意大利人可能在纽约被关进监狱一样。唯一可以放他走的人是意大利法院，如果你的姐夫有案子，你可以从领事馆获得帮助和建议，领事馆保护美国公民的权利。领事馆要到九点才开门。就算是我哥哥我也无能为力——”

‘Can you phone the Consulate?’ she broke in.
“你能给领事馆打电话吗？”她插话道。

‘We can’t interfere with the Consulate. When the Consul gets there at nine—‘
“我们不能干涉领事馆。当领事九点到达那里时——”

‘Can you give me his home address?’
“你能给我他的家庭住址吗？”

After a fractional pause the man shook his head. He took the memorandum from the porter and gave it to her.
短暂的停顿后，男人摇了摇头。他从门房手中接过备忘录，交给了她。

‘Now I’ll ask you to excuse me.’
“现在请你原谅。”

He had manoeuvred her to the door: for an instant the violet dawn fell shrilly upon his pink mask and upon the linen sack that supported his mustache; then Baby was standing on the front steps alone. She had been in the embassy ten minutes.
他把她带到了门口：一瞬间，紫罗兰色的黎明刺耳地落在他粉红色的面具和支撑他小胡子的亚麻布袋上。然后贝比独自站在门前的台阶上。她到大使馆已经十分钟了。

The piazza whereon it faced was empty save for an old man gathering cigarette butts with a spiked stick. Baby caught a taxi presently and went to the Consulate but there was no one there save a trio of wretched women scrubbing the stairs. She could not make them understand that she wanted the Consul’s home address—in a sudden resurgence of anxiety she rushed out and told the chauffeur to take her to the jail. He did not know where it was, but by the use of the words semper dritte, dextra and sinestra she manoeuvred him to its approximate locality, where she dismounted and explored a labyrinth of familiar alleys. But the buildings and the alleys all looked alike. Emerging from one trail into the Piazzo d’Espagna she saw the American Express Company and her heart lifted at the word ‘American’ on the sign. There was a light in the window and hurrying across the square she tried the door, but it was locked, and inside the clock stood at seven. Then she thought of Collis Clay.
它所面对的广场空无一人，只有一位老人正在用带刺的棍子收集烟蒂。贝比很快就打了一辆出租车，去了领事馆，但那里除了三个正在擦楼梯的可怜女人外，空无一人。她无法让他们明白她想要领事的家庭住址——突然焦虑起来，她冲了出去，让司机带她去监狱。他不知道它在哪里，但她用“semper dritte”、“dextra”和“sinestra”这些词把他带到了大概的位置，在那里她下了马，探索了熟悉的小巷迷宫。但建筑物和小巷看起来都很相似。从一条小路进入西班牙广场时，她看到了美国运通公司，看到招牌上的“美国”一词，她的心振奋起来。窗户里亮着光，她匆匆穿过广场，尝试开门，但门锁着，里面的钟指向七点。然后她想到了科利斯·克莱。

She remembered the name of his hotel, a stuffy villa sealed in red plush across from the Excelsior. The woman on duty at the office was not disposed to help her—she had no authority to disturb Mr. Clay, and refused to let Miss Warren go up to his room alone; convinced finally that this was not an affair of passion she accompanied her.
她记得他住的酒店的名字，是怡东酒店对面一座用红色毛绒封闭的闷热别墅。办公室的值班女士不愿意帮助她——她无权打扰克莱先生，并且拒绝让沃伦小姐单独去他的房间；她终于确信这不是一场激情的事情，她陪着她。

Collis lay naked upon his bed. He had come in tight and, awakening, it took him some moments to realize his nudity. He atoned for it by an excess of modesty. Taking his clothes into the bathroom he dressed in haste, muttering to himself ‘Gosh. She certainly musta got a good look at me.’ After some telephoning, he and Baby found the jail and went to it.
科利斯赤身裸体地躺在床上。他进来时很紧张，醒来后，过了好一会儿才意识到自己赤身裸体。他用过度的谦虚来弥补这一点。他拿着衣服走进浴室，匆匆穿好，自言自语道：“天哪。” “她一定好好看了我一眼。”打了几通电话后，他和贝比找到了监狱，去了那里。

The cell door was open and Dick was slumped on a chair in the guard-room. The carabinieri had washed some of the blood from his face, brushed him and set his hat concealingly upon his head.
牢房门开着，迪克瘫坐在警卫室的椅子上。宪兵洗掉了他脸上的一些血迹，给他擦了擦身子，然后把帽子隐蔽地戴在了他的头上。

Baby stood in the doorway trembling.
宝宝站在门口瑟瑟发抖。

‘Mr. Clay will stay with you,’ she said. ‘I want to get the Consul and a doctor.’
'先生。克莱会和你在一起，”她说。 “我想要找领事和医生。”

‘All right.’
'好的。'

‘Just stay quiet.’
“保持安静。”

‘All right.’
'好的。'

‘I’ll be back.’
'我会回来的。'

She drove to the Consulate; it was after eight now, and she was permitted to sit in the ante-room. Toward nine the Consul came in and Baby, hysterical with impotence and exhaustion, repeated her story. The Consul was disturbed. He warned her against getting into brawls in strange cities, but he was chiefly concerned that she should wait outside—with despair she read in his elderly eye that he wanted to be mixed up as little as possible in this catastrophe. Waiting on his action, she passed the minutes by phoning a doctor to go to Dick. There were other people in the ante-room and several were admitted to the Consul’s office. After half an hour she chose the moment of some one’s coming out and pushed past the secretary into the room.
她开车去领事馆；现在已经八点多了，她被允许坐在前厅里。九点左右，领事进来了，贝比因无力和疲惫而歇斯底里，重复了她的故事。领事很不安。他警告她不要在陌生的城市里打架，但他主要担心的是她应该在外面等着——她绝望地从他苍老的眼睛里读到，他希望尽可能少地卷入这场灾难。等待他的行动，她打电话给医生去看迪克，打发了几分钟的时间。接待室里还有其他人，其中有几个人被允许进入领事办公室。半个小时后，她挑了一个人出来的时间，推开秘书走进了房间。

‘This is outrageous! An American has been beaten half to death and thrown into prison and you make no move to help.’
‘这太离谱了！一个美国人被打得半死，还被关进监狱，你却没有出手相救。”

‘Just a minute, Mrs—‘
“请稍等，夫人——”

‘I’ve waited long enough. You come right down to the jail and get him out!’
‘我已经等得够久了。你直接到监狱把他救出来！”

‘Mrs—‘
'太太-'

‘We’re people of considerable standing in America—‘ Her mouth hardened as she continued. ‘If it wasn’t for the scandal we can—I shall see that your indifference to this matter is reported in the proper quarter. If my brother-in-law were a British citizen he’d have been free hours ago, but you’re more concerned with what the police will think than about what you’re here for.’
“我们在美国是有相当地位的人——”她继续说道，嘴角变得坚硬起来。 “如果不是因为丑闻，我们可以——我会确保你对此事的漠不关心在适当的季度得到报道。如果我的姐夫是英国公民，他几个小时前就已经自由了，但你更关心的是警察会怎么想，而不是你来这里的目的。

‘Mrs.—‘
'太太。-'

‘You put on your hat and come with me right away.’
“你戴上帽子，马上跟我来。”

The mention of his hat alarmed the Consul who began to clean his spectacles hurriedly and to ruffle his papers. This proved of no avail: the American Woman, aroused, stood over him; the cleansweeping irrational temper that had broken the moral back of a race and made a nursery out of a continent, was too much for him. He rang for the vice-consul—Baby had won.
提到他的帽子，领事惊慌失措，他开始赶紧擦眼镜，弄乱证件。事实证明这并没有什么用处：美国女人兴奋起来，站在他身边。这种彻底的、非理性的脾气，打破了一个种族的道德脊梁，把一个大陆变成了一个托儿所，对他来说实在是太难以忍受了。他按铃叫副领事——贝比赢了。

Dick sat in the sunshine that fell profusely through the guard-room window. Collis was with him and two carabinieri, and they were waiting for something to happen. With the narrowed vision of his one eye Dick could see the carabinieri; they were Tuscan peasants with short upper lips and he found it difficult to associate them with the brutality of last night. He sent one of them to fetch him a glass of beer.
迪克坐在从警卫室窗户倾泻而下的阳光下。科利斯和他以及两名宪兵在一起，他们正在等待事情发生。迪克用一只眼睛的狭窄视野可以看到宪兵。他们是托斯卡纳农民，上唇较短，他发现很难将他们与昨晚的暴行联系起来。他派了一个人去给他倒了一杯啤酒。

The beer made him light-headed and the episode was momentarily illumined by a ray of sardonic humor. Collis was under the impression that the English girl had something to do with the catastrophe, but Dick was sure she had disappeared long before it happened. Collis was still absorbed by the fact that Miss Warren had found him naked on his bed.
啤酒使他头晕目眩，这一情节瞬间被一丝讽刺的幽默所照亮。科利斯的印象是那个英国女孩与这场灾难有关，但迪克确信她早在灾难发生之前就失踪了。科利斯仍然沉浸在沃伦小姐发现他赤身裸体躺在床上的事实中。

Dick’s rage had retreated into him a little and he felt a vast criminal irresponsibility. What had happened to him was so awful that nothing could make any difference unless he could choke it to death, and, as this was unlikely, he was hopeless. He would be a different person henceforward, and in his raw state he had bizarre feelings of what the new self would be. The matter had about it the impersonal quality of an act of God. No mature Aryan is able to profit by a humiliation; when he forgives it has become part of his life, he has identified himself with the thing which has humiliated him—an upshot that in this case was impossible.
迪克的怒火稍稍消退了一些，他感到一种巨大的犯罪不责任感。发生在他身上的事情太可怕了，除非他能把它窒息而死，否则没有任何改变，而且，因为这不太可能，所以他已经绝望了。从此他将是一个不同的人，在他的原始状态下，他对新的自我会是什么样子有一种奇怪的感觉。这件事具有天灾的非个人性质。成熟的雅利安人不可能从羞辱中获益。当他宽恕时，它已成为他生活的一部分，他就将自己与羞辱他的事物等同起来——在这种情况下，这是不可能的结果。

When Collis spoke of retribution, Dick shook his head and was silent. A lieutenant of carabinieri, pressed, burnished, vital, came into the room like three men and the guards jumped to attention. He seized the empty beer bottle and directed a stream of scolding at his men. The new spirit was in him, and the first thing was to get the beer bottle out of the guard-room. Dick looked at Collis and laughed.
当科利斯谈到报应时，迪克摇了摇头，沉默了。一名宪兵中尉像三个男人一样走进房间，神情严肃、光彩照人、充满活力，警卫们立刻立正。他抓起空啤酒瓶，对着手下破口大骂。他精神焕发，第一件事就是把啤酒瓶从警卫室里拿出来。迪克看着科利斯笑了。

The vice-consul, an over-worked young man named Swanson, arrived, and they started to the court; Collis and Swanson on either side of Dick and the two carabinieri close behind. It was a yellow, hazy morning; the squares and arcades were crowded and Dick, pulling his hat low over his head, walked fast, setting the pace, until one of the short-legged carabinieri ran alongside and protested. Swanson arranged matters.
副领事是一位劳累过度的年轻人，名叫斯旺森，他到了，他们开始前往法庭。科利斯和斯旺森分别位于迪克两侧，两名宪兵紧随其后。那是一个黄色的、朦胧的早晨。广场和拱廊上挤满了人，迪克把帽子低低地盖在头上，快步走着，控制着步伐，直到一名短腿宪兵跑到旁边抗议。斯旺森安排了事情。

‘I’ve disgraced you, haven’t I?’ said Dick jovially.
“我让你蒙羞了，不是吗？”迪克快活地说。

‘You’re liable to get killed fighting Italians,’ replied Swanson sheepishly. ‘They’ll probably let you go this time but if you were an Italian you’d get a couple of months in prison. And how!’
“你和意大利人战斗很可能会被杀，”斯旺森不好意思地回答道。 “这次他们可能会放你走，但如果你是意大利人，你会被判入狱几个月。如何！'

‘Have you ever been in prison?’
“你坐过牢吗？”

Swanson laughed.
斯旺森笑了。

‘I like him,’ announced Dick to Clay. ‘He’s a very likeable young man and he gives people excellent advice, but I’ll bet he’s been to jail himself. Probably spent weeks at a time in jail.’
“我喜欢他，”迪克对克莱宣布。 “他是一个非常讨人喜欢的年轻人，他给人们提供了很好的建议，但我敢打赌他自己也进过监狱。可能一次在监狱里呆了几周。

Swanson laughed.
斯旺森笑了。

‘I mean you want to be careful. You don’t know how these people are.’
“我的意思是你要小心一点。你不知道这些人怎么样。

‘Oh, I know how they are,’ broke out Dick, irritably. ‘They’re god damn stinkers.’ He turned around to the carabinieri: ‘Did you get that?’
“哦，我知道他们是怎么回事。”迪克恼怒地说道。 “他们真是该死的臭东西。”他转身对宪兵说：“你明白了吗？”

‘I’m leaving you here,’ Swanson said quickly. ‘I told your sisterin-law I would—our lawyer will meet you upstairs in the courtroom. You want to be careful.’
“我要把你留在这里，”斯旺森很快说道。 “我告诉过你的嫂子，我们的律师会在楼上的法庭与你会面。你要小心点。

‘Good-by.’ Dick shook hands politely. ‘Thank you very much. I feel you have a future—‘
“再见。”迪克礼貌地握手。 '非常感谢。我觉得你有未来——”

With another smile Swanson hurried away, resuming his official expression of disapproval.
斯旺森又微笑了一下，匆匆走开，恢复了他正式的不赞成表情。

Now they came into a courtyard on all four sides of which outer stairways mounted to the chambers above. As they crossed the flags a groaning, hissing, booing sound went up from the loiterers in the courtyard, voices full of fury and scorn. Dick stared about.
现在他们进入了一个庭院，庭院的四个侧面都有外部楼梯通向上面的房间。当他们穿过旗帜时，院子里闲逛的人发出呻吟、嘶嘶、嘘声，声音充满了愤怒和蔑视。迪克环顾四周。

‘What’s that?’ he demanded, aghast.
“那是什么？”他惊愕地问道。

One of the carabinieri spoke to a group of men and the sound died away.
一名宪兵对一群人说话，声音渐渐消失。

They came into the court-room. A shabby Italian lawyer from the Consulate spoke at length to the judge while Dick and Collis waited aside. Some one who knew English turned from the window that gave on the yard and explained the sound that had accompanied their passage through. A native of Frascati had raped and slain a fiveyear-old child and was to be brought in that morning—the crowd had assumed it was Dick.
他们来到法庭。领事馆的一位衣衫褴褛的意大利律师对法官进行了长篇大论，而迪克和科利斯则在一旁等待。一些懂英语的人从面向院子的窗户转过身来，解释了伴随着他们穿过的声音。一名弗拉斯卡蒂人强奸并杀害了一名五岁儿童，并于当天早上被带进来——人们以为那是迪克。

In a few minutes the lawyer told Dick that he was freed—the court considered him punished enough.
几分钟后，律师告诉迪克他被释放了——法庭认为他受到的惩罚已经足够了。

‘Enough!’ Dick cried. ‘Punished for what?’
“够了！”迪克喊道。 “因为什么受到惩罚？”

‘Come along,’ said Collis. ‘You can’t do anything now.’
“来吧，”科利斯说。 “你现在什么也做不了。”

‘But what did I do, except get into a fight with some taxi-men?’
“但是除了和一些出租车司机打架之外，我还做了什么？”

‘They claim you went up to a detective as if you were going to shake hands with him and hit him—‘
“他们声称你走向一名侦探，就好像你要与他握手并打他一样——”

‘That’s not true! I told him I was going to hit him—I didn’t know he was a detective.’
'这不是真的！我告诉他我要打他——我不知道他是一名侦探。

‘You better go along,’ urged the lawyer.
“你最好也跟着去，”律师催促道。

‘Come along.’ Collis took his arm and they descended the steps.
“来吧。”科利斯挽着他的手臂，他们下了台阶。

‘I want to make a speech,’ Dick cried. ‘I want to explain to these people how I raped a five-year-old girl. Maybe I did—‘
“我想发表演讲，”迪克喊道。 “我想向这些人解释我是如何强奸一名五岁女孩的。也许我确实——”

‘Come along.’
'一起来。'

Baby was waiting with a doctor in a taxi-cab. Dick did not want to look at her and he disliked the doctor, whose stern manner revealed him as one of that least palpable of European types, the Latin moralist. Dick summed up his conception of the disaster, but no one had much to say. In his room in the Quirinal the doctor washed off the rest of the blood and the oily sweat, set his nose, his fractured ribs and fingers, disinfected the smaller wounds and put a hopeful dressing on the eye. Dick asked for a quarter of a grain of morphine, for he was still wide awake and full of nervous energy. With the morphine he fell asleep; the doctor and Collis left and Baby waited with him until a woman could arrive from the English nursing home. It had been a hard night but she had the satisfaction of feeling that, whatever Dick’s previous record was, they now possessed a moral superiority over him for as long as he proved of any use.
宝贝和医生一起在出租车里等着。迪克不想看她，也不喜欢医生，他严厉的态度表明他是欧洲人中最难以察觉的类型之一，拉丁道德家。迪克总结了他对这场灾难的看法，但没有人多说什么。在奎里纳尔的房间里，医生洗掉了剩余的血液和油腻的汗水，包扎了他的鼻子、骨折的肋骨和手指，对较小的伤口进行了消毒，并在眼睛上敷上了充满希望的敷料。迪克要了四分之一粒吗啡，因为他仍然很清醒，而且充满了紧张的能量。服用吗啡后，他睡着了。医生和科利斯离开了，贝比和他一起等待，直到一位妇女从英国疗养院赶来。这是一个艰难的夜晚，但她满意地感觉到，无论迪克以前的记录如何，只要他证明有任何用处，他们现在就比他拥有道德优势。

I

Frau Kaethe Gregorovius overtook her husband on the path of their villa.
凯瑟·格雷戈罗维乌斯女士在通往别墅的路上追上了她的丈夫。

‘How was Nicole?’ she asked mildly; but she spoke out of breath, giving away the fact that she had held the question in her mind during her run.
“妮可怎么样？”她温和地问道。但她说话时气喘吁吁，这表明她在跑步时一直在心里思考着这个问题。

Franz looked at her in surprise.
弗朗兹惊讶地看着她。

‘Nicole’s not sick. What makes you ask, dearest one?’
“妮可没有生病。是什么让你这么问，亲爱的？

‘You see her so much—I thought she must be sick.’
“你经常见到她——我想她一定是病了。”

‘We will talk of this in the house.’
“我们会在家里讨论这件事。”

Kaethe agreed meekly. His study was over in the administration building and the children were with their tutor in the living-room; they went up to the bedroom.
凯瑟温顺地答应了。他在行政大楼里的学习结束了，孩子们和他们的导师一起在客厅里。他们上楼去了卧室。

‘Excuse me, Franz,’ said Kaethe before he could speak. ‘Excuse me, dear, I had no right to say that. I know my obligations and I am proud of them. But there is a bad feeling between Nicole and me.’
“对不起，弗朗茨，”凯西还没来得及说话就说道。 “对不起，亲爱的，我没有权利这么说。我知道我的义务，并为此感到自豪。但妮可和我之间有一种不好的感觉。”

‘Birds in their little nests agree,’ Franz thundered. Finding the tone inappropriate to the sentiment he repeated his command in the spaced and considered rhythm with which his old master, Doctor Dohmler, could cast significance on the tritest platitude. ‘Birds— in—their—nests—AGREE!’
“小巢里的鸟儿都同意，”弗朗茨大声说道。他发现语气不适合他的情绪，他以一种间隔开、深思熟虑的节奏重复了他的命令，他的老主人多姆勒医生可以用这种节奏来赋予陈词滥调以意义。 “鸟儿——在——它们的——巢里——同意！”

‘I realize that. You haven’t seen me fail in courtesy toward Nicole.’
“我意识到了这一点。你没见过我对妮可没有礼貌。

‘I see you failing in common sense. Nicole is half a patient—she will possibly remain something of a patient all her life. In the absence of Dick I am responsible.’ He hesitated; sometimes as a quiet joke he tried to keep news from Kaethe. ‘There was a cable from Rome this morning. Dick has had grippe and is starting home to-morrow.’
“我发现你缺乏常识。妮可是半个病人——她可能终生仍是个病人。 “迪克不在的时候，我就要负责。”他犹豫了一下；有时，他会开个小玩笑，试图向凯西隐瞒消息。 “今天早上有一封来自罗马的电报。迪克得了流行性感冒，明天就要回家了。”

Relieved, Kaethe pursued her course in a less personal tone:
凯瑟如释重负，以不那么个人化的语气继续她的课程：

‘I think Nicole is less sick than any one thinks—she only cherishes her illness as an instrument of power. She ought to be in the cinema, like your Norma Talmadge—that’s where all American women would be happy.’
“我认为妮可的病没有任何人想象的那么严重——她只是把自己的疾病视为权力的工具。她应该在电影院里，就像你的诺玛·塔尔梅奇一样——那是所有美国女性都会高兴的地方。

‘Are you jealous of Norma Talmadge, on a film?’
“你嫉妒电影中的诺玛·塔尔梅奇吗？”

‘I don’t like Americans. They’re selfish, SELF-ish!’
“我不喜欢美国人。他们很自私，自私！”

‘You like Dick?’
“你喜欢迪克吗？”

‘I like him,’ she admitted. ‘He’s different, he thinks of others.’
“我喜欢他，”她承认。 “他与众不同，他为别人着想。”

—And so does Norma Talmadge, Franz said to himself. Norma Talmadge must be a fine, noble woman beyond her loveliness. They must compel her to play foolish rôles; Norma Talmadge must be a woman whom it would be a great privilege to know.
——诺玛·塔尔梅奇也是如此，弗兰兹自言自语道。诺玛·塔尔梅奇一定是一位超越她的可爱的优秀、高贵的女人。他们必须强迫她扮演愚蠢的角色​​；诺玛·塔尔梅奇一定是一位很荣幸能认识她的女人。

Kaethe had forgotten about Norma Talmadge, a vivid shadow that she had fretted bitterly upon one night as they were driving home from the movies in Zurich.
凯西已经忘记了诺玛·塔尔梅奇，这个生动的影子让她在一天晚上从苏黎世看完电影开车回家时苦恼不已。

‘—Dick married Nicole for her money,’ she said. ‘That was his weakness—you hinted as much yourself one night.’
“迪克为了妮可的钱而娶了她，”她说。 “那是他的弱点——有一天晚上你自己也暗示过这一点。”

‘You’re being malicious.’
“你是恶意的。”

‘I shouldn’t have said that,’ she retracted. ‘We must all live together like birds, as you say. But it’s difficult when Nicole acts as—when Nicole pulls herself back a little, as if she were holding her breath—as if I SMELT bad!’
“我不应该这么说，”她收回道。 ‘正如你所说，我们必须像鸟儿一样生活在一起。但当妮可表现得像——当妮可把自己拉回来一点，就好像她屏住呼吸一样——就好像我闻起来很糟糕时，这就很困难了！

Kaethe had touched a material truth. She did most of her work herself, and, frugal, she bought few clothes. An American shopgirl, laundering two changes of underwear every night, would have noticed a hint of yesterday’s reawakened sweat about Kaethe’s person, less a smell than an ammoniacal reminder of the eternity of toil and decay. To Franz this was as natural as the thick dark scent of Kaethe’s hair, and he would have missed it equally; but to Nicole, born hating the smell of a nurse’s fingers dressing her, it was an offense only to be endured.
凯西触及了物质真理。她大部分工作都是自己做的，而且为了节俭，她买的衣服很少。一位美国女店员每晚洗两套内衣，她一定会注意到凯瑟身上昨天重新出现的汗水，与其说是一种气味，不如说是一种氨味，提醒着人们永恒的辛劳和腐烂。对弗朗茨来说，这就像凯西头发上浓浓的黑香味一样自然，他也会同样怀念它。但对于妮可来说，她生来就讨厌护士手指给她穿衣服的味道，这是一种只能忍受的冒犯。

‘And the children,’ Kaethe continued. ‘She doesn’t like them to play with our children—‘ but Franz had heard enough:
“还有孩子们，”凯西继续说道。 “她不喜欢他们和我们的孩子一起玩——”但弗朗茨已经听够了：

‘Hold your tongue—that kind of talk can hurt me professionally, since we owe this clinic to Nicole’s money. Let us have lunch.’
“闭嘴——这种言论可能会伤害我的职业生涯，因为我们的诊所是妮可的钱。”我们吃午饭吧。

Kaethe realized that her outburst had been ill-advised, but Franz’s last remark reminded her that other Americans had money, and a week later she put her dislike of Nicole into new words.
凯瑟意识到自己的爆发是不明智的，但弗朗茨的最后一句话提醒她其他美国人也有钱，一周后她用新的措辞表达了对妮可的厌恶。

The occasion was the dinner they tendered the Divers upon Dick’s return. Hardly had their footfalls ceased on the path when she shut the door and said to Franz:
场合是迪克回来后他们为戴弗夫妇举办的晚宴。他们的脚步声刚在路上停下来，她就关上门，对弗兰兹说道：

‘Did you see around his eyes? He’s been on a debauch!’
‘你看到他眼睛周围了吗？他已经放荡了！

‘Go gently,’ Franz requested. ‘Dick told me about that as soon as he came home. He was boxing on the trans-Atlantic ship. The American passengers box a lot on these trans-Atlantic ships.’
“轻轻地走，”弗兰兹请求道。 “迪克一回家就告诉了我这件事。他在跨大西洋的船上打拳击。这些跨大西洋游轮上有很多美国乘客。

‘I believe that?’ she scoffed. ‘It hurts him to move one of his arms and he has an unhealed scar on his temple—you can see where the hair’s been cut away.’
“我相信吗？”她嘲笑道。 “他移动一只手臂就会感到疼痛，太阳穴上有一道未愈合的伤疤——你可以看到头发被剪掉的地方。”

Franz had not noticed these details.
弗朗茨没有注意到这些细节。

‘But what?’ Kaethe demanded. ‘Do you think that sort of thing does the Clinic any good? The liquor I smelt on him tonight, and several other times since he’s been back.’
“但是什么？”凯西问道。 “你认为诊所做这种事有什么好处吗？”今晚我在他身上闻到了酒味，自从他回来后，我又闻到了好几次。”

She slowed her voice to fit the gravity of what she was about to say: ‘Dick is no longer a serious man.’
她放慢了声音，以适应她即将说的话的严肃性：“迪克不再是一个严肃的人了。”

Franz rocked his shoulders up the stairs, shaking off her persistence. In their bedroom he turned on her.
弗朗茨摇晃着肩膀走上楼梯，摆脱了她的坚持。在他们的卧室里，他向她发起攻击。

‘He is most certainly a serious man and a brilliant man. Of all the men who have recently taken their degrees in neuropathology in Zurich, Dick has been regarded as the most brilliant—more brilliant than I could ever be.’
“他无疑是一个严肃的人，也是一个才华横溢的人。在所有最近在苏黎世获得神经病理学学位的人中，迪克被认为是最聪明的——比我更聪明。

‘For shame!’
'耻辱！'

‘It’s the truth—the shame would be not to admit it. I turn to Dick when cases are highly involved. His publications are still standard in their line—go into any medical library and ask. Most students think he’s an Englishman—they don’t believe that such thoroughness could come out of America.’ He groaned domestically, taking his pajamas from under the pillow, ‘I can’t understand why you talk this way, Kaethe—I thought you liked him.’
“这是事实——不承认是耻辱。”当案件高度复杂时，我会求助于迪克。他的出版物仍然是标准的——去任何医学图书馆询问。大多数学生认为他是英国人——他们不相信美国能做出如此彻底的事情。”他从枕头底下拿出睡衣，在心里呻吟着，“我不明白你为什么这样说话，凯瑟——我想你喜欢他。

‘For shame!’ Kaethe said. ‘You’re the solid one, you do the work. It’s a case of hare and tortoise—and in my opinion the hare’s race is almost done.’
“真是耻辱！”凯西说。 ‘你是可靠的人，你做这项工作。这是兔子和乌龟的比赛——在我看来，兔子的比赛快结束了。

‘Tch! Tch!’
‘切！切！’

‘Very well, then. It’s true.’
'那好吧。这是真的。'

With his open hand he pushed down air briskly.
他张开双手，轻快地向下推空气。

‘Stop!’
'停止！'

The upshot was that they had exchanged viewpoints like debaters. Kaethe admitted to herself that she had been too hard on Dick, whom she admired and of whom she stood in awe, who had been so appreciative and understanding of herself. As for Franz, once Kaethe’s idea had had time to sink in, he never after believed that Dick was a serious person. And as time went on he convinced himself that he had never thought so.
结果，他们像辩手一样交换了观点。凯西向自己承认，她对迪克太严厉了，她钦佩迪克，对迪克感到敬畏，而迪克又如此欣赏和理解她自己。至于弗兰兹，一旦凯西的想法被接受了，他就不再相信迪克是一个认真的人。随着时间的推移，他说服自己，他从来没有这么想过。

II

Dick told Nicole an expurgated version of the catastrophe in Rome— in his version he had gone philanthropically to the rescue of a drunken friend. He could trust Baby Warren to hold her tongue, since he had painted the disastrous effect of the truth upon Nicole. All this, however, was a low hurdle compared to the lingering effect of the episode upon him.
迪克向妮可讲述了罗马灾难的删减版本——在他的版本中，他出于慈善目的营救了一位醉酒的朋友。他可以相信宝贝沃伦会保持沉默，因为他已经把真相给妮可带来了灾难性的影响。然而，与这件事对他造成的挥之不去的影响相比，这一切都算不上什么障碍。

In reaction he took himself for an intensified beating in his work, so that Franz, trying to break with him, could find no basis on which to begin a disagreement. No friendship worth the name was ever destroyed in an hour without some painful flesh being torn—so Franz let himself believe with ever-increasing conviction that Dick travelled intellectually and emotionally at such a rate of speed that the vibrations jarred him—this was a contrast that had previously been considered a virtue in their relation. So, for the shoddiness of needs, are shoes made out of last year’s hide.
作为回应，他认为自己在工作中受到了更严重的打击，因此弗朗茨试图与他决裂，但找不到任何基础来开始分歧。任何名副其实的友谊都会在一小时内被摧毁，而不会有一些痛苦的肉体被撕裂——所以弗兰茨让自己越来越相信迪克在智力和情感上的移动速度如此之快，以至于振动让他感到震惊——这是一个对比这在以前被认为是他们关系中的一种美德。因此，为了满足劣质的需求，鞋子是用去年的皮革制成的。

Yet it was May before Franz found an opportunity to insert the first wedge. Dick came into his office white and tired one noon and sat down, saying:
然而，直到五月，弗朗兹才找到机会插入第一个挖起杆。一天中午，迪克来到他的办公室，脸色苍白，疲惫不堪，坐下来说道：

‘Well, she’s gone.’
“好吧，她走了。”

‘She’s dead?’
'她死了？'

‘The heart quit.’
“心脏停止了。”

Dick sat exhausted in the chair nearest the door. During three nights he had remained with the scabbed anonymous woman-artist he had come to love, formally to portion out the adrenaline, but really to throw as much wan light as he could into the darkness ahead.
迪克疲惫地坐在最靠近门的椅子上。在三个晚上里，他一直和他所爱的那个伤痕累累的匿名女艺术家呆在一起，表面上是为了分配肾上腺素，但实际上是为了在前方的黑暗中尽可能多地投射出苍白的光芒。

Half appreciating his feeling, Franz travelled quickly over an opinion:
弗兰兹半欣赏着他的感觉，很快就提出了一个意见：

‘It was neuro-syphilis. All the Wassermans we took won’t tell me differently. The spinal fluid—‘
“这是神经梅毒。我们带走的所有瓦塞尔曼人都不会告诉我不同​​的情况。脊髓液——‘

‘Never mind,’ said Dick. ‘Oh, God, never mind! If she cared enough about her secret to take it away with her, let it go at that.’
“没关系，”迪克说。 ‘噢，上帝，别介意！如果她足够在乎自己的秘密，愿意把它带走，那就随它去吧。”

‘You better lay off for a day.’
“你最好休息一天。”

‘Don’t worry, I’m going to.’
“别担心，我会的。”

Franz had his wedge; looking up from the telegram that he was writing to the woman’s brother he inquired: ‘Or do you want to take a little trip?’
弗朗茨有他的楔子；他从正在写给那个女人的兄弟的电报中抬起头来问道：“或者你想去旅行一下吗？”

‘Not now.’
'现在不要。'

‘I don’t mean a vacation. There’s a case in Lausanne. I’ve been on the phone with a Chilian all morning—‘
“我的意思不是假期。洛桑有一个案例。我整个早上都在和一个智利人打电话——”

‘She was so damn brave,’ said Dick. ‘And it took her so long.’ Franz shook his head sympathetically and Dick got himself together. ‘Excuse me for interrupting you.’
“她真是太勇敢了，”迪克说。 “她花了这么长时间。”弗兰兹同情地摇摇头，迪克才平静下来。 “抱歉打扰你了。”

‘This is just a change—the situation is a father’s problem with his son—the father can’t get the son up here. He wants somebody to come down there.’
“这只是一个改变——情况是父亲与儿子的问题——父亲不能把儿子带到这里。”他希望有人到那里去。

‘What is it? Alcoholism? Homosexuality? When you say Lausanne—‘
'它是什么？酗酒？同性恋？当你说洛桑时——‘

‘A little of everything.’
“什么都有一点。”

‘I’ll go down. Is there any money in it?’
‘我下去吧。里面有钱吗？

‘Quite a lot, I’d say. Count on staying two or three days, and get the boy up here if he needs to be watched. In any case take your time, take your ease; combine business with pleasure.’
“我想说，相当多。”估计要呆两三天，如果需要看管的话，就把孩子叫到这里来。无论如何，慢慢来，放松；将工作与娱乐结合起来。”

After two hours’ train sleep Dick felt renewed, and he approached the interview with Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real in good spirits.
经过两个小时的火车睡眠后，迪克感觉精神焕发，他精神抖擞地接受了帕尔多·奎达·雷尔先生的采访。

These interviews were much of a type. Often the sheer hysteria of the family representative was as interesting psychologically as the condition of the patient. This one was no exception: Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real, a handsome iron-gray Spaniard, noble of carriage, with all the appurtenances of wealth and power, raged up and down his suite in the Hôtel de Trois Mondes and told the story of his son with no more self-control than a drunken woman.
这些采访在很大程度上是一种类型。通常，家庭代表的纯粹歇斯底里在心理上与病人的状况一样有趣。这一位也不例外：帕尔多·奎达·雷尔先生，一位英俊的铁灰色西班牙人，举止高贵，拥有财富和权力的所有附属物，在三世界酒店的套房里怒气冲冲，讲述了他的故事。儿子连醉酒的女人都没有自制力。

‘I am at the end of my invention. My son is corrupt. He was corrupt at Harrow, he was corrupt at King’s College, Cambridge. He’s incorrigibly corrupt. Now that there is this drinking it is more and more obvious how he is, and there is continual scandal. I have tried everything—I worked out a plan with a doctor friend of mine, sent them together for a tour of Spain. Every evening Francisco had an injection of cantharides and then the two went together to a reputable bordello—for a week or so it seemed to work but the result was nothing. Finally last week in this very room, rather in that bathroom—‘ he pointed at it, ‘—I made Francisco strip to the waist and lashed him with a whip—‘
“我的发明即将结束。我儿子腐败了他在哈罗公学腐败，在剑桥国王学院也腐败。他腐败得无可救药。现在有了这样的喝酒，他的样子就越来越明显了，而且绯闻不断。我已经尝试了一切——我和我的一位医生朋友制定了一个计划，让他们一起去西班牙旅行。每天晚上，弗朗西斯科都会注射斑蝥，然后两人一起去一家信誉良好的妓院——大约一个星期，这似乎有效，但结果却毫无效果。最后，上周就在这个房间里，而不是在那个浴室里——”他指着它，“——我让弗朗西斯科脱光了腰部，然后用鞭子抽打了他——”

Exhausted with his emotion he sat down and Dick spoke:
他的情绪让他筋疲力尽，他坐下来，迪克说道：

‘That was foolish—the trip to Spain was futile also—‘ He struggled against an upsurging hilarity—that any reputable medical man should have lent himself to such an amateurish experiment! ‘—Señor, I must tell you that in these cases we can promise nothing. In the case of the drinking we can often accomplish something—with proper co-operation. The first thing is to see the boy and get enough of his confidence to find whether he has any insight into the matter.’
“那太愚蠢了——西班牙之行也是徒劳的——”他努力克制着一种高涨的欢笑——任何一个有信誉的医生都会让自己参与这样一个业余的实验！ “——先生，我必须告诉您，在这种情况下我们不能做出任何承诺。就饮酒而言，通过适当的合作，我们通常可以完成一些事情。首先要见见这个男孩，让他有足够的信心，看看他是否对此事有洞察力。

—The boy, with whom he sat on the terrace, was about twenty, handsome and alert.
——和他一起坐在露台上的男孩大约二十岁，英俊而机警。

‘I’d like to know your attitude,’ Dick said. ‘Do you feel that the situation is getting worse? And do you want to do anything about it?’
“我想知道你的态度，”迪克说。 ‘你有没有感觉情况变得更糟了？你想为此做点什么吗？

‘I suppose I do,’ said Francisco, ‘I am very unhappy.’
“我想是的，”弗朗西斯科说，“我很不高兴。”

‘Do you think it’s from the drinking or from the abnormality?’
“你觉得是喝酒造成的还是异常造成的？”

‘I think the drinking is caused by the other.’ He was serious for a while—suddenly an irrepressible facetiousness broke through and he laughed, saying, ‘It’s hopeless. At King’s I was known as the Queen of Chili. That trip to Spain—all it did was to make me nauseated by the sight of a woman.’
“我认为喝酒是对方造成的。”他严肃了一会儿，突然抑制不住的玩笑爆发了，他笑道：“没救了。”在国王学院，我被称为“辣椒女王”。那次去西班牙的旅行——只是让我看到一个女人就感到恶心。”

Dick caught him up sharply.
迪克猛地追上了他。

‘If you’re happy in this mess, then I can’t help you and I’m wasting my time.’
“如果你在这种混乱中感到高兴，那么我帮不了你，我是在浪费时间。”

‘No, let’s talk—I despise most of the others so.’ There was some manliness in the boy, perverted now into an active resistance to his father. But he had that typically roguish look in his eyes that homosexuals assume in discussing the subject.
“不，我们谈谈——我是这么鄙视其他大多数人的。”男孩身上有一些男子气概，现在却变态到对他父亲的积极抵抗。但他的眼神里流露出同性恋者在讨论这个话题时典型的流氓表情。

‘It’s a hole-and-corner business at best,’ Dick told him. ‘You’ll spend your life on it, and its consequences, and you won’t have time or energy for any other decent or social act. If you want to face the world you’ll have to begin by controlling your sensuality— and, first of all, the drinking that provokes it—‘
“这充其量只是一个漏洞百出的生意，”迪克告诉他。 “你将把一生都花在它及其后果上，你不会有时间或精力进行任何其他体面或社交行为。如果你想面对这个世界，你就必须从控制你的情欲开始——首先，控制引发情欲的饮酒——”

He talked automatically, having abandoned the case ten minutes before. They talked pleasantly through another hour about the boy’s home in Chili and about his ambitions. It was as close as Dick had ever come to comprehending such a character from any but the pathological angle—he gathered that this very charm made it possible for Francisco to perpetrate his outrages, and, for Dick, charm always had an independent existence, whether it was the mad gallantry of the wretch who had died in the clinic this morning, or the courageous grace which this lost young man brought to a drab old story. Dick tried to dissect it into pieces small enough to store away—realizing that the totality of a life may be different in quality from its segments, and also that life during the forties seemed capable of being observed only in segments. His love for Nicole and Rosemary, his friendship with Abe North, with Tommy Barban in the broken universe of the war’s ending—in such contacts the personalities had seemed to press up so close to him that he became the personality itself—there seemed some necessity of taking all or nothing; it was as if for the remainder of his life he was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people, early met and early loved, and to be only as complete as they were complete themselves. There was some element of loneliness involved—so easy to be loved—so hard to love.
他本能地说道，十分钟前就放弃了这个案子。他们又愉快地聊了一个小时，谈论了男孩在智利的家和他的抱负。这是迪克从病态角度以外的任何角度来理解这样一个人物的最接近的——他认为正是这种魅力使弗朗西斯科有可能实施他的暴行，而且，对迪克来说，魅力总是独立存在的，无论是这是今天早上在诊所死去的不幸者的疯狂英勇，或者是这个迷失的年轻人给一个单调的老故事带来的勇敢的优雅。迪克试图将其分解成足够小的碎片，以便储存起来——他意识到，生活的整体可能与它的各个片段在质量上有所不同，而且四十年代的生活似乎只能以片段的形式来观察。他对妮可和罗斯玛丽的爱，他与阿贝·诺斯的友谊，以及在战争结束的破碎宇宙中与汤米·巴尔班的友谊——在这样的接触中，这些人物似乎离他如此之近，以至于他成为了人物本身——似乎有某种必然性要么全取，要么一无所有；就好像在他的余生中，他注定要带着某些人的自我，这些人很早就认识和爱过，并且只有像他们自己一样完整。其中涉及到一些孤独的因素——被爱如此容易，却很难去爱。

As he sat on the veranda with young Francisco, a ghost of the past swam into his ken. A tall, singularly swaying male detached himself from the shrubbery and approached Dick and Francisco with feeble resolution. For a moment he formed such an apologetic part of the vibrant landscape that Dick scarcely remarked him—then Dick was on his feet, shaking hands with an abstracted air, thinking, ‘My God, I’ve stirred up a nest!’ and trying to collect the man’s name.
当他和年轻的弗朗西斯科坐在阳台上时，过去的幽灵游进了他的视野。一只身材高大、摇摇欲坠的雄性从灌木丛中挣脱出来，带着微弱的决心向迪克和弗朗西斯科走近。有一瞬间，他在这片生机勃勃的风景中成为了一个充满歉意的部分，迪克几乎没有注意到他——然后迪克站起来，心不在焉地握手，心想，“天啊，我搅动了一个巢穴！”并试图收集该男子的姓名。

‘This is Doctor Diver, isn’t it?’
“这是戴弗医生，不是吗？”

‘Well, well—Mr. Dumphry, isn’t it?’
‘好吧，好吧——先生。邓弗里，不是吗？

‘Royal Dumphry. I had the pleasure of having dinner one night in that lovely garden of yours.’
“皇家邓弗里。”有一天晚上，我很高兴在你那个美丽的花园里吃晚饭。”

‘Of course.’ Trying to dampen Mr. Dumphry’s enthusiasm, Dick went into impersonal chronology. ‘It was in nineteen—twenty-four—or twenty-five—‘
“当然。”为了抑制邓弗里先生的热情，迪克开始按非个人的时间顺序进行叙述。 “那是在十九——二十四——或者二十五——”

He had remained standing, but Royal Dumphry, shy as he had seemed at first, was no laggard with his pick and spade; he spoke to Francisco in a flip, intimate manner, but the latter, ashamed of him, joined Dick in trying to freeze him away.
他一直站着，但皇家邓弗里虽然一开始看起来很害羞，但他的镐和铁锹并不落后。他以一种轻率而亲密的方式与弗朗西斯科交谈，但弗朗西斯科为他感到羞耻，并与迪克一起试图将他拒之门外。

‘Doctor Diver—one thing I want to say before you go. I’ve never forgotten that evening in your garden—how nice you and your wife were. To me it’s one of the finest memories in my life, one of the happiest ones. I’ve always thought of it as the most civilized gathering of people that I have ever known.’
“戴弗博士——在你走之前我想说一件事。我永远不会忘记在你花园里的那个晚上——你和你的妻子是多么友善。对我来说，这是我一生中最美好的回忆之一，也是最幸福的回忆之一。我一直认为这是我所认识的最文明的人们聚会。

Dick continued a crab-like retreat toward the nearest door of the hotel.
迪克继续像螃蟹一样向最近的酒店门口撤退。

‘I’m glad you remembered it so pleasantly. Now I’ve got to see—‘
“我很高兴你记得这么愉快。现在我必须看到——”

‘I understand,’ Royal Dumphry pursued sympathetically. ‘I hear he’s dying.’
“我明白，”罗亚尔·邓弗里同情地追问。 “我听说他快要死了。”

‘Who’s dying?’
“谁快死了？”

‘Perhaps I shouldn’t have said that—but we have the same physician.’
“也许我不应该这么说——但我们有同一个医生。”

Dick paused, regarding him in astonishment. ‘Who’re you talking about?’
迪克停了下来，惊讶地看着他。 “你在说谁？”

‘Why, your wife’s father—perhaps I—‘
“为什么，你妻子的父亲——也许我——”

‘My WHAT?’
“我的什么？”

‘I suppose—you mean I’m the first person—‘
“我想——你的意思是我是第一个人——”

‘You mean my wife’s father is here, in Lausanne?’
“你的意思是我妻子的父亲在这里，在洛桑？”

‘Why, I thought you knew—I thought that was why you were here.’
“为什么，我以为你知道——我以为这就是你来这里的原因。”

‘What doctor is taking care of him?’
“哪位医生正在照顾他？”

Dick scrawled the name in a notebook, excused himself, and hurried to a telephone booth.
迪克在笔记本上潦草地写下了这个名字，道了歉，然后匆匆走向电话亭。

It was convenient for Doctor Dangeu to see Doctor Diver at his house immediately.
丹吉乌医生很方便，可以立即到他家去见戴弗医生。

Doctor Dangeu was a young Génevois; for a moment he was afraid that he was going to lose a profitable patient, but, when Dick reassured him, he divulged the fact that Mr. Warren was indeed dying.
丹格医生是一位年轻的热内瓦人。有一瞬间，他担心自己会失去一位有利可图的病人，但是，当迪克向他保证时，他透露了沃伦先生确实快要死了的事实。

‘He is only fifty but the liver has stopped restoring itself; the precipitating factor is alcoholism.’
“他才五十岁，肝脏已经停止恢复了；诱发因素是酗酒。”

‘Doesn’t respond?’
“没有回应？”

‘The man can take nothing except liquids—I give him three days, or at most, a week.’
“这个人除了液体之外什么都不能吃——我给他三天，或者最多一个星期。”

‘Does his elder daughter, Miss Warren, know his condition?’
“他的大女儿沃伦小姐知道他的病情吗？”

‘By his own wish no one knows except the man-servant. It was only this morning I felt I had to tell him—he took it excitedly, although he has been in a very religious and resigned mood from the beginning of his illness.’
‘根据他自己的意愿，除了男仆之外，没有人知道。直到今天早上，我才觉得我必须告诉他——他很兴奋地接受了这件事，尽管他从生病开始就一直处于一种非常虔诚和顺从的情绪中。

Dick considered: ‘Well—‘ he decided slowly, ‘in any case I’ll take care of the family angle. But I imagine they would want a consultation.’
迪克想了想：“好吧——”他慢慢决定，“无论如何，我会照顾家庭的。”但我想他们会想要咨询。”

‘As you like.’
'随你便。'

‘I know I speak for them when I ask you to call in one of the bestknown medicine men around the lake—Herbrugge, from Geneva.’
“当我请你请来湖边最著名的医生之一——来自日内瓦的赫尔布鲁日时，我知道我是在代表他们说话。”

‘I was thinking of Herbrugge.’
“我想到了赫布鲁日。”

‘Meanwhile I’m here for a day at least and I’ll keep in touch with you.’
“同时我至少在这里待一天，我会与你保持联系。”

That evening Dick went to Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real and they talked.
那天晚上，迪克去找帕尔多和奎达雷尔先生，他们进行了交谈。

‘We have large estates in Chili—‘ said the old man. ‘My son could well be taking care of them. Or I can get him in any one of a dozen enterprises in Paris—‘ He shook his head and paced across the windows against a spring rain so cheerful that it didn’t even drive the swans to cover, ‘My only son! Can’t you take him with you?’
“我们在辣椒有很大的庄园——”老人说。 “我的儿子很可能会照顾他们。或者我可以让他进入巴黎十几家企业中的任何一家——”他摇摇头，顶着春雨在窗户上踱步，春雨如此欢快，连天鹅都没有被驱赶，“我唯一的儿子！你不能带他一起去吗？

The Spaniard knelt suddenly at Dick’s feet.
西班牙人突然跪在迪克脚边。

‘Can’t you cure my only son? I believe in you—you can take him with you, cure him.’
‘你不能治愈我唯一的儿子吗？我相信你——你可以带着他一起走，治愈他。”

‘It’s impossible to commit a person on such grounds. I wouldn’t if I could.’
“不可能以这样的理由来犯罪。”如果可以的话我不会。

The Spaniard got up from his knees.
西班牙人从膝盖上站了起来。

‘I have been hasty—I have been driven—‘
“我太仓促了——我被逼迫了——”

Descending to the lobby Dick met Doctor Dangeu in the elevator.
迪克下楼到大厅，在电梯里遇见了丹格医生。

‘I was about to call your room,’ the latter said. ‘Can we speak out on the terrace?’
“我正要给你的房间打电话，”后者说道。 “我们可以在露台上说话吗？”

‘Is Mr. Warren dead?’ Dick demanded.
“沃伦先生死了吗？”迪克问道。

‘He is the same—the consultation is in the morning. Meanwhile he wants to see his daughter—your wife—with the greatest fervor. It seems there was some quarrel—‘
“他也是一样——咨询是在早上。”与此同时，他想以最大的热情见到他的女儿——你的妻子。好像发生了一些争吵——”

‘I know all about that.’
“我知道这一切。”

The doctors looked at each other, thinking.
医生们面面相觑，思考着。

‘Why don’t you talk to him before you make up your mind?’ Dangeu suggested. ‘His death will be graceful—merely a weakening and sinking.’
“在你做出决定之前，为什么不先跟他谈谈呢？”丹格乌建议道。 “他的死将是优雅的——只是一种虚弱和沉沦。”

With an effort Dick consented.
迪克费了好大劲才同意了。

‘All right.’
'好的。'

The suite in which Devereux Warren was gracefully weakening and sinking was of the same size as that of the Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real—throughout this hotel there were many chambers wherein rich ruins, fugitives from justice, claimants to the thrones of mediatized principalities, lived on the derivatives of opium or barbitol listening eternally as to an inescapable radio, to the coarse melodies of old sins. This corner of Europe does not so much draw people as accept them without inconvenient questions. Routes cross here—people bound for private sanitariums or tuberculosis resorts in the mountains, people who are no longer persona gratis in France or Italy.
德弗罗·沃伦优雅地衰弱和沉没的套房与帕尔多和奎达·雷亚尔先生的套房大小相同——整个酒店有许多房间，里面住着丰富的废墟、逃亡者、媒体公国王位的索取者。依靠鸦片或巴比妥的衍生物，永远聆听着不可避免的收音机，聆听着旧罪的粗俗旋律。欧洲的这个角落与其说是吸引人们，不如说是接纳他们而不提出不便的问题。路线在这里交汇——前往山区私人疗养院或结核病度假村的人们，以及在法国或意大利不再是免费人员的人们。

The suite was darkened. A nun with a holy face was nursing the man whose emaciated fingers stirred a rosary on the white sheet. He was still handsome and his voice summoned up a thick burr of individuality as he spoke to Dick, after Dangeu had left them together.
套房里一片漆黑。一位面容圣洁的修女正在护理那个男人，他瘦弱的手指在白色床单上搅动着一串念珠。他仍然很英俊，在丹格离开他们之后，当他和迪克说话时，他的声音充满了个性。

‘We get a lot of understanding at the end of life. Only now, Doctor Diver, do I realize what it was all about.’
“在生命的尽头，我们得到了很多理解。直到现在，戴弗医生，我才明白这到底是怎么回事。”

Dick waited.
迪克等待着。

‘I’ve been a bad man. You must know how little right I have to see Nicole again, yet a Bigger Man than either of us says to forgive and to pity.’ The rosary slipped from his weak hands and slid off the smooth bed covers. Dick picked it up for him. ‘If I could see Nicole for ten minutes I would go happy out of the world.’
‘我一直是个坏人。你一定知道，我没有权利再次见到妮可，但他是一个比我们任何一个人都大的人，无法原谅和怜悯。”念珠从他虚弱的手中滑落，从光滑的床罩上滑落。迪克帮他捡起来。 “如果我能看到妮可十分钟，我就会高兴地离开这个世界。”

‘It’s not a decision I can make for myself,’ said Dick. ‘Nicole is not strong.’ He made his decision but pretended to hesitate. ‘I can put it up to my professional associate.’
“这不是我可以自己做出的决定，”迪克说。 “妮可并不坚强。”他做出了决定，但又假装犹豫。 “我可以把它交给我的专业同事。”

‘What your associate says goes with me—very well, Doctor. Let me tell you my debt to you is so large—‘
“你的同事说的话我同意——很好，医生。让我告诉你，我欠你的债是如此之大——”

Dick stood up quickly.
迪克迅速站了起来。

‘I’ll let you know the result through Doctor Dangeu.’
“我会通过 Dangeu 医生告诉你结果。”

In his room he called the clinic on the Zugersee. After a long time Kaethe answered from her own house.
在他的房间里，他给祖格湖上的诊所打电话。过了很长一段时间，凯瑟从她自己的家里接了电话。

‘I want to get in touch with Franz.’
“我想与弗兰茨取得联系。”

‘Franz is up on the mountain. I’m going up myself—is it something I can tell him, Dick?’
“弗朗茨在山上。我要亲自上去——我可以告诉他什么吗，迪克？

‘It’s about Nicole—her father is dying here in Lausanne. Tell Franz that, to show him it’s important; and ask him to phone me from up there.’
“这是关于妮可的——她的父亲即将在洛桑去世。告诉弗兰兹，让他知道这很重要；让他从上面给我打电话。

‘I will.’
'我会。'

‘Tell him I’ll be in my room here at the hotel from three to five, and again from seven to eight, and after that to page me in the dining-room.’
“告诉他，三点到五点我会在酒店的房间里，然后七点到八点，然后到餐厅传呼我。”

In plotting these hours he forgot to add that Nicole was not to be told; when he remembered it he was talking into a dead telephone. Certainly Kaethe should realize.
在规划这些时间时，他忘记补充一点，不要告诉妮可；她必须告诉她。当他想起来的时候，他正在对着一部没电的电话说话。凯瑟当然应该意识到。

... Kaethe had no exact intention of telling Nicole about the call when she rode up the deserted hill of mountain wild-flowers and secret winds, where the patients were taken to ski in winter and to climb in spring. Getting off the train she saw Nicole shepherding the children through some organized romp. Approaching, she drew her arm gently along Nicole’s shoulder, saying: ‘You are clever with children—you must teach them more about swimming in the summer.’
……当凯西骑马爬上满是野花和神秘风的荒山时，凯西并没有确切的意图告诉妮可这个电话，那里的病人冬天被带到滑雪，春天被带到爬山。下了火车，她看到妮可正在带领孩子们进行一些有组织的嬉戏。她走近，轻轻地用手臂拉着妮可的肩膀，说道：“你对孩子们很聪明——你必须在夏天教他们更多关于游泳的知识。”

In the play they had grown hot, and Nicole’s reflex in drawing away from Kaethe’s arm was automatic to the point of rudeness. Kaethe’s hand fell awkwardly into space, and then she too reacted, verbally, and deplorably.
在剧中，他们变得很热，妮可本能地从凯西的手臂上抽开，甚至到了粗鲁的地步。凯西的手笨拙地落入空中，然后她也做出了口头上的、令人遗憾的反应。

‘Did you think I was going to embrace you?’ she demanded sharply. ‘It was only about Dick, I talked on the phone to him and I was sorry—‘
“你以为我会拥抱你吗？”她尖锐地问道。 “这只是关于迪克的事，我在电话里和他谈过，我很抱歉——”

‘Is anything the matter with Dick?’
“迪克有什么事吗？”

Kaethe suddenly realized her error, but she had taken a tactless course and there was no choice but to answer as Nicole pursued her with reiterated questions: ‘... then why were you sorry?’
凯瑟突然意识到自己的错误，但她的做法有些不圆滑，只好回答，妮可追着她一再追问：“……那你为什么道歉？”

‘Nothing about Dick. I must talk to Franz.’
“没有关于迪克的事。”我必须和弗兰兹谈谈。

‘It is about Dick.’
“是关于迪克的。”

There was terror in her face and collaborating alarm in the faces of the Diver children, near at hand. Kaethe collapsed with: ‘Your father is ill in Lausanne—Dick wants to talk to Franz about it.’
她脸上写满了恐惧，附近的戴弗孩子们脸上也写满了惊慌。凯瑟崩溃了：“你父亲在洛桑病了——迪克想和弗兰茨谈谈这件事。”

‘Is he very sick?’ Nicole demanded—just as Franz came up with his hearty hospital manner. Gratefully Kaethe passed the remnant of the buck to him—but the damage was done.
“他病得很重吗？”妮可问道——就在弗兰茨摆出他那热情的医院态度时。凯瑟感激地把剩下的责任转嫁给了他——但损害已经造成了。

‘I’m going to Lausanne,’ announced Nicole.
“我要去洛桑，”妮可宣布。

‘One minute,’ said Franz. ‘I’m not sure it’s advisable. I must first talk on the phone to Dick.’
“等一下，”弗朗茨说。 “我不确定这是否可取。我必须先和迪克通电话。

‘Then I’ll miss the train down,’ Nicole protested, ‘and then I’ll miss the three o’clock from Zurich! If my father is dying I must—‘ She left this in the air, afraid to formulate it. ‘I MUST go. I’ll have to run for the train.’ She was running even as she spoke toward the sequence of flat cars that crowned the bare hill with bursting steam and sound. Over her shoulder she called back, ‘If you phone Dick tell him I’m coming, Franz!’ ...
“那我就会错过下来的火车，”妮可抗议道，“然后我就会错过三点钟从苏黎世出发的火车！”如果我父亲快要死了，我必须——”她把这句话悬而未决，不敢说出来。 '我必须去。我得跑去赶火车。”她边跑边对着光秃秃的山上一排排平板车说话，这些车充满了爆裂的蒸汽和声音。她回头喊道：“如果你打电话给迪克，就告诉他我来了，弗兰兹！”

... Dick was in his own room in the hotel reading The New York Herald when the swallow-like nun rushed in—simultaneously the phone rang.
……迪克正在酒店自己的房间里读《纽约先驱报》，这时燕子般的修女冲了进来——同时电话响了。

‘Is he dead?’ Dick demanded of the nun, hopefully.
“他死了吗？”迪克满怀希望地问修女。

‘Monsieur, il est parti—he has gone away.’
“先生，il est party——他已经走了。”

‘Com-MENT?’
'评论？'

‘Il est parti—his man and his baggage have gone away too!’
“Il est party——他的人和他的行李也走了！”

It was incredible. A man in that condition to arise and depart.
实在太棒了。一个人在这种情况下出现和离开。

Dick answered the phone-call from Franz. ‘You shouldn’t have told Nicole,’ he protested.
迪克接听了弗朗茨打来的电话。 “你不应该告诉妮可，”他抗议道。

‘Kaethe told her, very unwisely.’
“凯西告诉了她，这非常不明智。”

‘I suppose it was my fault. Never tell a thing to a woman till it’s done. However, I’ll meet Nicole ... say, Franz, the craziest thing has happened down here—the old boy took up his bed and walked... .’
‘我想这是我的错。在事情完成之前永远不要告诉女人任何事情。然而，我会见到妮可……比如说，弗兰茨，这里发生了最疯狂的事情——老男孩拿起他的床走了……”

‘At what? What did you say?’
‘什么时候？你说什么？'

‘I say he walked, old Warren—he walked!’
“我说他走了，老沃伦——他走了！”

‘But why not?’
“但为什么不呢？”

‘He was supposed to be dying of general collapse ... he got up and walked away, back to Chicago, I guess... . I don’t know, the nurse is here now... . I don’t know, Franz—I’ve just heard about it... . Call me later.’
“他本来应该因全身崩溃而死去……他站起来走开了，我猜回到了芝加哥……”我不知道，护士现在就在这里……我不知道，弗朗茨——我刚刚听说过……稍后给我打电话。

He spent the better part of two hours tracing Warren’s movements. The patient had found an opportunity between the change of day and night nurses to resort to the bar where he had gulped down four whiskeys; he paid his hotel bill with a thousand dollar note, instructing the desk that the change should be sent after him, and departed, presumably for America. A last minute dash by Dick and Dangeu to overtake him at the station resulted only in Dick’s failing to meet Nicole; when they did meet in the lobby of the hotel she seemed suddenly tired, and there was a tight purse to her lips that disquieted him.
他花了两个小时的大部分时间追踪沃伦的行踪。病人在值班护士和夜班护士轮流之间找到了一个机会去酒吧，在那里他喝下了四杯威士忌。他用一张一千美元的钞票支付了酒店账单，指示前台将零钱寄给他，然后就离开了，大概是去美国了。迪克和丹格乌在车站最后一刻冲过去追上他，结果迪克没能见到妮可。当他们在酒店大堂见面时，她似乎突然感到疲倦，嘴唇紧闭的钱包让他感到不安。

‘How’s father?’ she demanded.
“父亲怎么样？”她问道。

‘He’s much better. He seemed to have a good deal of reserve energy after all.’ He hesitated, breaking it to her easy. ‘In fact he got up and went away.’
‘他好多了。他似乎还是有很多储备能量。”他犹豫了一下，轻松地向她打断了这句话。 “事实上，他站起来就走了。”

Wanting a drink, for the chase had occupied the dinner hour, he led her, puzzled, toward the grill, and continued as they occupied two leather easy-chairs and ordered a high-ball and a glass of beer: ‘The man who was taking care of him made a wrong prognosis or something—wait a minute, I’ve hardly had time to think the thing out myself.’
由于这场追逐占据了晚餐时间，他想要喝一杯，他困惑地领着她走向烤架，然后继续，他们占据了两张皮革安乐椅，点了一杯高球酒和一杯啤酒：“那个男人照顾他做出了错误的预测或其他什么——等一下，我几乎没有时间自己思考这件事。

‘He’s GONE?’
'他走了？'

‘He got the evening train for Paris.’
“他搭乘晚班火车前往巴黎。”

They sat silent. From Nicole flowed a vast tragic apathy.
他们静静地坐着。妮可身上流露出一种巨大的悲剧性的冷漠。

‘It was instinct,’ Dick said, finally. ‘He was really dying, but he tried to get a resumption of rhythm—he’s not the first person that ever walked off his death-bed—like an old clock—you know, you shake it and somehow from sheer habit it gets going again. Now your father—‘
“这是本能，”迪克最后说道。 “他真的快要死了，但他试图恢复节奏——他不是第一个从临终床上走下来的人——就像一个旧钟——你知道，你摇动它，不知怎的，出于纯粹的习惯，它又开始运转了。” 。现在你的父亲——”

‘Oh, don’t tell me,’ she said.
“哦，别告诉我，”她说。

‘His principal fuel was fear,’ he continued. ‘He got afraid, and off he went. He’ll probably live till ninety—‘
“他的主要动力是恐惧，”他继续说道。 ‘他害怕了，就走了。他可能会活到九十岁——”

‘Please don’t tell me any more,’ she said. ‘Please don’t—I couldn’t stand any more.’
“请不要再告诉我了，”她说。 “请不要——我再也忍受不了了。”

‘All right. The little devil I came down to see is hopeless. We may as well go back to-morrow.’
'好的。我下来看到的小恶魔已经绝望了。我们还是明天回去吧。

‘I don’t see why you have to—come in contact with all this,’ she burst forth.
“我不明白为什么你必须——接触这一切，”她突然说道。

‘Oh, don’t you? Sometimes I don’t either.’
‘哦，不是吗？有时我也不这样做。

She put her hand on his.
她把手放在他的手上。

‘Oh, I’m sorry I said that, Dick.’
“哦，很抱歉我这么说了，迪克。”

Some one had brought a phonograph into the bar and they sat listening to The Wedding of the Painted Doll.
有人把留声机带进酒吧，他们坐着听《彩绘娃娃的婚礼》。

III
三、

One morning a week later, stopping at the desk for his mail, Dick became aware of some extra commotion outside: Patient Von Cohn Morris was going away. His parents, Australians, were putting his baggage vehemently into a large limousine, and beside them stood Doctor Ladislau protesting with ineffectual attitudes against the violent gesturings of Morris, senior. The young man was regarding his embarkation with aloof cynicism as Doctor Diver approached.
一周后的一天早上，迪克在办公桌前取邮件时，注意到外面有一些额外的骚动：病人冯·科恩·莫里斯要走了。他的父母是澳大利亚人，正在激烈地把他的行李放进一辆大型豪华轿车，拉迪斯劳医生站在他们旁边，以无效的态度抗议老莫里斯的暴力手势。当戴弗博士走近时，年轻人正以一种冷漠的愤世嫉俗的态度看待他的登船。

‘Isn’t this a little sudden, Mr. Morris?’
“莫里斯先生，是不是有点突然？”

Mr. Morris started as he saw Dick—his florid face and the large checks on his suit seemed to turn off and on like electric lights. He approached Dick as though to strike him.
莫里斯先生一看到迪克就吃了一惊——他红润的脸和西装上的大格子似乎像电灯一样忽明忽暗。他靠近迪克，好像要打他。

‘High time we left, we and those who have come with us,’ he began, and paused for breath. ‘It is high time, Doctor Diver. High time.’
“我们该离开了，我们和那些跟我们一起来的人，”他开始说道，然后停下来喘了口气。 “时间到了，戴弗博士。”时间到了。’

‘Will you come in my office?’ Dick suggested.
“你能来我办公室吗？”迪克建议道。

‘Not I! I’ll talk to you, but I’m washing my hands of you and your place.’
‘不是我！我会和你谈谈，但我不会再碰你和你的地方了。

He shook his finger at Dick. ‘I was just telling this doctor here. We’ve wasted our time and our money.’
他对迪克摇了摇手指。 “我只是在这里告诉这位医生。我们浪费了时间和金钱。

Doctor Ladislau stirred in a feeble negative, signalling up a vague Slavic evasiveness. Dick had never liked Ladislau. He managed to walk the excited Australian along the path in the direction of his office, trying to persuade him to enter; but the man shook his head.
拉迪斯劳医生语带微弱地否定，暗示着一种模糊的斯拉夫式的回避。迪克从来不喜欢拉迪斯劳。他设法带着这位兴奋的澳大利亚人沿着小路朝他的办公室方向走去，试图说服他进去。但那人却摇了摇头。

‘It’s you, Doctor Diver, YOU, the very man. I went to Doctor Ladislau because you were not to be found, Doctor Diver, and because Doctor Gregorovius is not expected until the nightfall, and I would not wait. No, sir! I would not wait a minute after my son told me the truth.’
“是你，戴弗医生，你，就是你。”我去找拉迪斯劳医生是因为你找不到你，戴弗医生，而且因为格雷戈罗维斯医生要到夜幕降临时才会出现，而我不会等待。不，先生！当我的儿子告诉我真相后，我一刻也不会等待。

He came up menacingly to Dick, who kept his hands loose enough to drop him if it seemed necessary. ‘My son is here for alcoholism, and he told us he smelt liquor on your breath. Yes, sir!’ He made a quick, apparently unsuccessful sniff. ‘Not once, but twice Von Cohn says he has smelt liquor on your breath. I and my lady have never touched a drop of it in our lives. We hand Von Cohn to you to be cured, and within a month he twice smells liquor on your breath! What kind of cure is that there?’
他威胁性地走到迪克面前，而迪克则松开双手，必要时可以放开他。 “我儿子来这里是因为酗酒，他告诉我们他在你的呼吸中闻到了酒味。是的，先生！”他快速地吸了吸鼻子，但显然没有成功。 “冯·科恩不是一次，而是两次说他在你的呼吸中闻到了酒味。我和我的夫人一生中从未碰过一滴它。我们把冯·科恩交给你来治愈，一个月内他两次在你的呼吸中闻到酒味！那是什么治疗方法？

Dick hesitated; Mr. Morris was quite capable of making a scene on the clinic drive.
迪克犹豫了。莫里斯先生很有能力在诊所的车道上大吵大闹。

‘After all, Mr. Morris, some people are not going to give up what they regard as food because of your son—‘
“毕竟，莫里斯先生，有些人不会因为你的儿子而放弃他们所认为的食物——”

‘But you’re a doctor, man!’ cried Morris furiously. ‘When the workmen drink their beer that’s bad ‘cess to them—but you’re here supposing to cure—‘
“但你是一名医生，伙计！”莫里斯愤怒地喊道。 “当工人们喝啤酒时，这对他们来说是不好的——但你来这里是为了治愈——”

‘This has gone too far. Your son came to us because of kleptomania.’
‘这已经太过分了。你儿子因为盗窃癖来到我们这里。

‘What was behind it?’ The man was almost shrieking. ‘Drink—black drink. Do you know what color black is? It’s black! My own uncle was hung by the neck because of it, you hear? My son comes to a sanitarium, and a doctor reeks of it!’
“后面是什么？”那人几乎尖叫起来。 ‘喝——黑饮料。你知道黑色是什么颜色吗？是黑色的！我自己的叔叔因此被勒住脖子，你听到了吗？我儿子来到疗养院，医生身上散发着臭味！”

‘I must ask you to leave.’
“我必须请你离开。”

‘You ASK me! We ARE leaving!’
'你问我！我们走了！'

‘If you could be a little temperate we could tell you the results of the treatment to date. Naturally, since you feel as you do, we would not want your son as a patient—‘
“如果你能温和一点，我们可以告诉你迄今为止的治疗结果。当然，既然你有这样的感觉，我们就不希望你儿子成为病人——”

‘You dare to use the word temperate to me?’
“你敢对我用温和这个词？”

Dick called to Doctor Ladislau and as he approached, said: ‘Will you represent us in saying good-by to the patient and to his family?’
迪克打电话给拉迪斯劳医生，当他走近时，他说：“你能代表我们向病人和他的家人告别吗？”

He bowed slightly to Morris and went into his office, and stood rigid for a moment just inside the door. He watched until they drove away, the gross parents, the bland, degenerate offspring: it was easy to prophesy the family’s swing around Europe, bullying their betters with hard ignorance and hard money. But what absorbed Dick after the disappearance of the caravan was the question as to what extent he had provoked this. He drank claret with each meal, took a nightcap, generally in the form of hot rum, and sometimes he tippled with gin in the afternoons—gin was the most difficult to detect on the breath. He was averaging a halfpint of alcohol a day, too much for his system to burn up.
他向莫里斯微微鞠了一躬，然后走进自己的办公室，在门内僵硬地站了一会儿。他看着他们开车离开，粗俗的父母，平淡、堕落的后代：很容易预言这个家庭会在欧洲各地摇摆不定，用无知和金钱欺负比他们更好的人。但商队消失后，迪克最关心的问题是他在多大程度上挑起了这件事。他每顿饭都会喝波尔多红酒，睡前喝一杯，通常是热朗姆酒，有时下午他会喝点杜松子酒——杜松子酒是最难从呼吸中察觉到的。他平均每天喝半品脱的酒，太多了，以至于他的身体系统无法燃烧。

Dismissing a tendency to justify himself, he sat down at his desk and wrote out, like a prescription, a régime that would cut his liquor in half. Doctors, chauffeurs, and Protestant clergymen could never smell of liquor, as could painters, brokers, cavalry leaders; Dick blamed himself only for indiscretion. But the matter was by no means clarified half an hour later when Franz, revivified by an Alpine fortnight, rolled up the drive, so eager to resume work that he was plunged in it before he reached his office. Dick met him there.
他摒弃了为自己辩护的倾向，坐在办公桌前，像处方一样写下了一个可以将酒量减半的方案。医生、司机和新教牧师永远闻不到酒味，画家、经纪人、骑兵领袖也一样。迪克只责怪自己的轻率行为。但半小时后，事情并没有得到澄清，弗朗兹在阿尔卑斯山两周后恢复了活力，他卷起车道，急于恢复工作，以至于在到达办公室之前就陷入了困境。迪克在那里遇见了他。

‘How was Mount Everest?’
“珠穆朗玛峰怎么样？”

‘We could very well have done Mount Everest the rate we were doing. We thought of it. How goes it all? How is my Kaethe, how is your Nicole?’
“我们完全可以按照现在的速度完成珠穆朗玛峰的攀登。我们想到了。一切进展如何？我的凯西怎么样，你的妮可怎么样？

‘All goes smooth domestically. But my God, Franz, we had a rotten scene this morning.’
“国内一切顺利。但天哪，弗朗茨，今天早上我们看到了糟糕的一幕。”

‘How? What was it?’
'如何？它以前如何？'

Dick walked around the room while Franz got in touch with his villa by telephone. After the family exchange was over, Dick said: ‘The Morris boy was taken away—there was a row.’
迪克在房间里走来走去，弗朗兹则通过电话与他的别墅取得联系。家庭交流结束后，迪克说：“莫里斯男孩被带走了——发生了争吵。”

Franz’s buoyant face fell.
弗兰茨的表情沉了下来。

‘I knew he’d left. I met Ladislau on the veranda.’
“我知道他已经离开了。我在阳台上遇见了拉迪斯劳。

‘What did Ladislau say?’
“拉迪斯劳说什么？”

‘Just that young Morris had gone—that you’d tell me about it. What about it?’
“只是年轻的莫里斯走了——你会告诉我这件事。那又怎样呢？

‘The usual incoherent reasons.’
“通常的不连贯的原因。”

‘He was a devil, that boy.’
“那个男孩，他是个魔鬼。”

‘He was a case for anesthesia,’ Dick agreed. ‘Anyhow, the father had beaten Ladislau into a colonial subject by the time I came along. What about Ladislau? Do we keep him? I say no—he’s not much of a man, he can’t seem to cope with anything.’ Dick hesitated on the verge of the truth, swung away to give himself space within which to recapitulate. Franz perched on the edge of a desk, still in his linen duster and travelling gloves. Dick said:
“他需要麻醉，”迪克同意道。 “不管怎样，当我来的时候，父亲已经把拉迪斯劳打成了殖民地臣民。拉迪斯劳呢？我们留住他吗？我说不——他不太像个男人，他似乎无法应对任何事情。”迪克在真相边缘犹豫了一下，转身离开，给自己留出空间来进行重述。弗朗兹坐在桌子边缘，身上仍然穿着亚麻抹布，戴着旅行手套。迪克说：

‘One of the remarks the boy made to his father was that your distinguished collaborator was a drunkard. The man is a fanatic, and the descendant seems to have caught traces of vin-du-pays on me.’
“男孩对他父亲说过的话之一是，你杰出的合作者是个酒鬼。这个人是个狂热分子，而后裔似乎在我身上发现了vin-du-pays的痕迹。”

Franz sat down, musing on his lower lip. ‘You can tell me at length,’ he said finally.
弗朗兹坐下来，抿着下唇沉思着。 “你可以详细地告诉我，”他最后说道。

‘Why not now?’ Dick suggested. ‘You must know I’m the last man to abuse liquor.’ His eyes and Franz’s glinted on each other, pair on pair. ‘Ladislau let the man get so worked up that I was on the defensive. It might have happened in front of patients, and you can imagine how hard it could be to defend yourself in a situation like that!’
“为什么不现在呢？”迪克建议道。 “你一定知道我是最后一个酗酒的人。”他的眼睛和弗兰茨的眼睛相互闪烁，一对对着。 “拉迪斯劳让这个人变得如此激动，以至于我处于防守状态。它可能发生在病人面前，你可以想象在这种情况下保护自己是多么困难！

Franz took off his gloves and coat. He went to the door and told the secretary, ‘Don’t disturb us.’ Coming back into the room he flung himself at the long table and fooled with his mail, reasoning as little as is characteristic of people in such postures, rather summoning up a suitable mask for what he had to say.
弗朗茨脱下手套和外套。他走到门口，对秘书说：“别打扰我们。”回到房间后，他扑到长桌上，摆弄着他的邮件，像这种姿势的人所特有的那样，他很少进行推理，而是在召唤为他要说的话准备一个合适的面具。

‘Dick, I know well that you are a temperate, well-balanced man, even though we do not entirely agree on the subject of alcohol. But a time has come—Dick, I must say frankly that I have been aware several times that you have had a drink when it was not the moment to have one. There is some reason. Why not try another leave of abstinence?’
“迪克，我很清楚你是一个温和、平衡的人，尽管我们在酒精问题上并不完全一致。但现在已经到了——迪克，我必须坦白地说，我已经好几次意识到你在不该喝酒的时候喝了一杯。这是有原因的。为什么不尝试再次禁欲呢？

‘Absence,’ Dick corrected him automatically. ‘It’s no solution for me to go away.’
“缺席，”迪克不假思索地纠正他。 “离开对我来说并不是解决办法。”

They were both chafed, Franz at having his return marred and blurred.
他们都感到恼火，弗兰茨对他的回归受到损害和模糊感到恼火。

‘Sometimes you don’t use your common sense, Dick.’
“有时候你不运用常识，迪克。”

‘I never understood what common sense meant applied to complicated problems—unless it means that a general practitioner can perform a better operation than a specialist.’
“我从来不明白常识对于复杂问题意味着什么——除非这意味着全科医生可以比专科医生做得更好。”

He was seized by an overwhelming disgust for the situation. To explain, to patch—these were not natural functions at their age— better to continue with the cracked echo of an old truth in the ears.
他对这种情况感到极度厌恶。解释、修补——在他们这个年纪，这些都不是自然的功能——最好继续听听耳边古老真理的破碎回声。

‘This is no go,’ he said suddenly.
“这是不行的，”他突然说道。

‘Well, that’s occurred to me,’ Franz admitted. ‘Your heart isn’t in this project any more, Dick.’
“好吧，我也想到了这一点，”弗兰兹承认道。 “你的心不再在这个项目上了，迪克。”

‘I know. I want to leave—we could strike some arrangement about taking Nicole’s money out gradually.’
'我知道。我想离开——我们可以达成一些安排，逐步将妮可的钱取出来。

‘I have thought about that too, Dick—I have seen this coming. I am able to arrange other backing, and it will be possible to take all your money out by the end of the year.’
“我也想过这个问题，迪克——我已经预见到了这一点。我可以安排其他支持，年底前可以把你所有的钱都拿出来。”

Dick had not intended to come to a decision so quickly, nor was he prepared for Franz’s so ready acquiescence in the break, yet he was relieved. Not without desperation he had long felt the ethics of his profession dissolving into a lifeless mass.
迪克本来不打算这么快做出决定，也没有准备好接受弗兰兹在休息时如此默许，但他松了口气。长期以来，他一直感到自己的职业道德正在消解成一团毫无生气的东西，这并非没有绝望。

IV

The Divers would return to the Riviera, which was home. The Villa Diana had been rented again for the summer, so they divided the intervening time between German spas and French cathedral towns where they were always happy for a few days. Dick wrote a little with no particular method; it was one of those parts of life that is an awaiting; not upon Nicole’s health, which seemed to thrive on travel, nor upon work, but simply an awaiting. The factor that gave purposefulness to the period was the children.
潜水员队将返回里维埃拉，那里是他们的家。戴安娜别墅夏天又被租了，所以他们把中间的时间分配在德国温泉和法国大教堂小镇之间，在那里他们总是开心地度过几天。迪克写了一点，没有什么特别的方法；这是生命中值得等待的部分之一；不是因为妮可的健康，她的健康似乎因旅行而蓬勃发展，也不是因为工作，而只是一种等待。赋予这一时期意义的因素是孩子们。

Dick’s interest in them increased with their ages, now eleven and nine. He managed to reach them over the heads of employees on the principle that both the forcing of children and the fear of forcing them were inadequate substitutes for the long, careful watchfulness, the checking and balancing and reckoning of accounts, to the end that there should be no slip below a certain level of duty. He came to know them much better than Nicole did, and in expansive moods over the wines of several countries he talked and played with them at length. They had that wistful charm, almost sadness, peculiar to children who have learned early not to cry or laugh with abandon; they were apparently moved to no extremes of emotion, but content with a simple regimentation and the simple pleasures allowed them. They lived on the even tenor found advisable in the experience of old families of the Western world, brought up rather than brought out. Dick thought, for example, that nothing was more conducive to the development of observation than compulsory silence.
迪克对他们的兴趣随着他们年龄的增长而增加，现在他们分别是十一岁和九岁。他成功地超越了员工的理解，其原则是，强迫儿童和害怕强迫他们都不足以替代长期、仔细的监视、检查、平衡和算账，最终，不得低于一定的职责水平。他比妮可更了解他们，在品尝了几个国家的葡萄酒后，他与他们进行了长时间的交谈和玩耍。它们有一种渴望的魅力，几乎是悲伤的，这是那些很早就学会不放纵地哭泣或大笑的孩子所特有的。他们显然没有被感动到极端的情绪，而是满足于简单的管制和简单的快乐所允许的。他们生活在西方世界古老家庭的经验中所建议的平等基调上，是被养大的，而不是被带出来的。例如，迪克认为，没有什么比强制沉默更有利于观察力的发展了。

Lanier was an unpredictable boy with an inhuman curiosity. ‘Well, how many Pomeranians would it take to lick a lion, father?’ was typical of the questions with which he harassed Dick. Topsy was easier. She was nine and very fair and exquisitely made like Nicole, and in the past Dick had worried about that. Lately she had become as robust as any American child. He was satisfied with them both, but conveyed the fact to them only in a tacit way. They were not let off breaches of good conduct—‘Either one learns politeness at home,’ Dick said, ‘or the world teaches it to you with a whip and you may get hurt in the process. What do I care whether Topsy ‘adores’ me or not? I’m not bringing her up to be my wife.’
拉尼尔是一个难以捉摸的男孩，有着非人的好奇心。 “好吧，爸爸，需要多少只博美犬才能舔一头狮子？”这是他骚扰迪克的典型问题。托普西更容易。她九岁了，皮肤白皙，身材精致，就像妮可一样，迪克过去曾为此担心过。最近她变得像任何美国孩子一样健壮。他对他们俩都很满意，但只是以一种默契的方式向他们传达了这个事实。他们不会放过违反良好行为的行为——“要么在家里学会礼貌，”迪克说，“要么这个世界用鞭子教你礼貌，而你可能会在这个过程中受伤。托普西是否“崇拜”我与我有何关系？我不会把她培养成我的妻子。

Another element that distinguished this summer and autumn for the Divers was a plenitude of money. Due to the sale of their interest in the clinic, and to developments in America, there was now so much that the mere spending of it, the care of goods, was an absorption in itself. The style in which they travelled seemed fabulous.
今年夏天和秋天，潜水员队的另一个显着特征是资金充裕。由于出售了他们对诊所的兴趣，以及美国的发展，现在的情况如此之多，以至于仅仅花费它、护理物品本身就是一种专注。他们旅行的方式看起来棒极了。

Regard them, for example, as the train slows up at Boyen where they are to spend a fortnight visiting. The shifting from the wagon-lit has begun at the Italian frontier. The governess’s maid and Madame Diver’s maid have come up from second class to help with the baggage and the dogs. Mlle. Bellois will superintend the handluggage, leaving the Sealyhams to one maid and the pair of Pekinese to the other. It is not necessarily poverty of spirit that makes a woman surround herself with life—it can be a superabundance of interest, and, except during her flashes of illness, Nicole was capable of being curator of it all. For example with the great quantity of heavy baggage—presently from the van would be unloaded four wardrobe trunks, a shoe trunk, three hat trunks, and two hat boxes, a chest of servants’ trunks, a portable filing-cabinet, a medicine case, a spirit lamp container, a picnic set, four tennis rackets in presses and cases, a phonograph, a typewriter. Distributed among the spaces reserved for family and entourage were two dozen supplementary grips, satchels and packages, each one numbered, down to the tag on the cane case. Thus all of it could be checked up in two minutes on any station platform, some for storage, some for accompaniment from the ‘light trip list’ or the ‘heavy trip list,’ constantly revised, and carried on metal-edged plaques in Nicole’s purse. She had devised the system as a child when travelling with her failing mother. It was equivalent to the system of a regimental supply officer who must think of the bellies and equipment of three thousand men.
例如，当火车在博伊恩放慢速度时，他们将在那里度过两周的时间。意大利边境已经开始从马车照明开始转变。家庭女教师的女仆和戴弗夫人的女仆已经从二等舱上来帮忙搬运行李和狗。女士。贝卢瓦将负责管理手提行李，将西利厄姆一家留给一名女仆，将两只哈巴狗留给另一名女仆。使一个女人充满生活的不一定是精神上的匮乏——它可能是一种过度的兴趣，而且，除了在她生病的时候，妮可有能力成为这一切的管理者。例如，大量的重行李——很快就会从货车上卸下四个衣柜箱、一个鞋箱、三个帽箱、两个帽盒、一箱仆人箱、一个便携式文件柜、一个药箱。 、一个酒精灯容器、一套野餐套装、四个装在压机和盒子里的网球拍、一台留声机、一台打字机。为家人和随行人员保留的空间中分布着两打辅助握把、书包和包裹，每一件都编号，一直到手杖箱上的标签。因此，所有这些都可以在任何站台上在两分钟内检查完毕，有些用于存储，有些用于“轻旅行清单”或“重旅行清单”中的伴奏，不断修订，并在妮可的金属边缘铭牌上进行。钱包。当她还是个孩子的时候，当她和她失败的母亲一起旅行时，她设计了这个系统。这就相当于团补给官的制度，必须要考虑到三千人的肚子和装备。

The Divers flocked from the train into the early gathered twilight of the valley. The village people watched the debarkation with an awe akin to that which followed the Italian pilgrimages of Lord Byron a century before. Their hostess was the Contessa di Minghetti, lately Mary North. The journey that had begun in a room over the shop of a paperhanger in Newark had ended in an extraordinary marriage.
潜水员们从火车上蜂拥而至，进入山谷的晨曦中。村民们怀着敬畏的心情观看登船，就像一个世纪前拜伦勋爵在意大利朝圣时那样。他们的女主人是明盖蒂伯爵夫人，即后来的玛丽·诺斯。这段旅程始于纽瓦克一家裱纸店楼上的房间，最终以一场非凡的婚姻结束。

‘Conte di Minghetti’ was merely a papal title—the wealth of Mary’s husband flowed from his being ruler-owner of manganese deposits in southwestern Asia. He was not quite light enough to travel in a pullman south of Mason-Dixon; he was of the Kyble-Berber-SabaeanHindu strain that belts across north Africa and Asia, more sympathetic to the European than the mongrel faces of the ports.
“Conte di Minghetti”只是一个教皇头衔——玛丽丈夫的财富来自于他作为西南亚锰矿的统治者和所有者。他的体重还不够轻，无法乘坐普尔曼轿车前往梅森迪克森以南的地方。他属于遍布北非和亚洲的凯布尔-柏柏尔-萨巴伊印度教血统，他比港口里的杂种面孔更同情欧洲人。

When these princely households, one of the East, one of the West, faced each other on the station platform, the splendor of the Divers seemed pioneer simplicity by comparison. Their hosts were accompanied by an Italian major-domo carrying a staff, by a quartet of turbaned retainers on motorcycles, and by two half-veiled females who stood respectfully a little behind Mary and salaamed at Nicole, making her jump with the gesture.
当这些一东一西的王公贵族在站台上对峙时，戴弗家族的辉煌相比之下显得格外朴素。陪同他们的东道主的还有一位拿着手杖的意大利管家、四名骑着摩托车戴头巾的随从，还有两名半戴面纱的女性，她们恭敬地站在玛丽身后不远的地方，向妮可致敬，让她随着这个手势跳了起来。

To Mary as well as to the Divers the greeting was faintly comic; Mary gave an apologetic, belittling giggle; yet her voice, as she introduced her husband by his Asiatic title, flew proud and high.
对于玛丽和戴弗夫妇来说，这种问候有点滑稽。玛丽抱歉地、轻视地咯咯笑了一声。然而，当她介绍她丈夫的亚洲头衔时，她的声音却显得骄傲而高亢。

In their rooms as they dressed for dinner, Dick and Nicole grimaced at each other in an awed way: such rich as want to be thought democratic pretend in private to be swept off their feet by swank.
迪克和妮可在房间里穿好衣服去吃晚饭，他们互相做了个鬼脸，充满敬畏：像这样有钱的人想被认为是民主的，私下里假装被炫耀迷倒了。

‘Little Mary North knows what she wants,’ Dick muttered through his shaving cream. ‘Abe educated her, and now she’s married to a Buddha. If Europe ever goes Bolshevik she’ll turn up as the bride of Stalin.’
“小玛丽·诺斯知道她想要什么，”迪克隔着剃须膏嘀咕道。 ‘安倍教育了她，现在她嫁给了佛陀。如果欧洲走向布尔什维克，她就会成为斯大林的新娘。”

Nicole looked around from her dressing-case. ‘Watch your tongue, Dick, will you?’ But she laughed. ‘They’re very swell. The warships all fire at them or salute them or something. Mary rides in the royal bus in London.’
妮可从她的化妆箱里环顾四周。 “注意你的舌头，迪克，好吗？”但她笑了。 ‘他们非常膨胀。战舰都向他们开火或者敬礼什么的。玛丽乘坐伦敦的皇家巴士。

‘All right,’ he agreed. As he heard Nicole at the door asking for pins, he called, ‘I wonder if I could have some whiskey; I feel the mountain air!’
“好吧，”他同意了。当他听到妮可在门口索要别针时，他喊道：“我想知道是否可以喝点威士忌；我可以喝点吗？”我感受到了山间的空气！

‘She’ll see to it,’ presently Nicole called through the bathroom door. ‘It was one of those women who were at the station. She has her veil off.’
“她会处理好的，”不久妮可从浴室门外喊道。 “这是车站里的一位妇女。她摘下了面纱。

‘What did Mary tell you about life?’ he asked.
“关于生活，玛丽告诉了你什么？”他问道。

‘She didn’t say so much—she was interested in high life—she asked me a lot of questions about my genealogy and all that sort of thing, as if I knew anything about it. But it seems the bridegroom has two very tan children by another marriage—one of them ill with some Asiatic thing they can’t diagnose. I’ve got to warn the children. Sounds very peculiar to me. Mary will see how we’d feel about it.’ She stood worrying a minute.
“她没说太多——她对上流生活很感兴趣——她问了我很多关于我的家谱之类的问题，好像我对此一无所知。但新郎似乎在另一次婚姻中生了两个晒得黝黑的孩子——其中一个患有某种他们无法诊断的亚洲疾病。我必须警告孩子们。对我来说听起来很奇怪。玛丽会看看我们对此有何感受。”她站在那里担心了一会儿。

‘She’ll understand,’ Dick reassured her. ‘Probably the child’s in bed.’
“她会理解的，”迪克向她保证。 “孩子可能已经在床上了。”

At dinner Dick talked to Hosain, who had been at an English public school. Hosain wanted to know about stocks and about Hollywood and Dick, whipping up his imagination with champagne, told him preposterous tales.
晚餐时，迪克与曾在英国公立学校就读的侯赛因进行了交谈。侯赛因想了解股票和好莱坞，迪克用香槟激发了他的想象力，给他讲了一些荒谬的故事。

‘Billions?’ Hosain demanded.
“数十亿？”侯赛因问道。

‘Trillions,’ Dick assured him.
“数万亿，”迪克向他保证。

‘I didn’t truly realize—‘
“我并没有真正意识到——”

‘Well, perhaps millions,’ Dick conceded. ‘Every hotel guest is assigned a harem—or what amounts to a harem.’
“嗯，也许有数百万，”迪克承认。 “每位酒店客人都被分配了一个后宫——或者说相当于一个后宫。”

‘Other than the actors and directors?’
“除了演员和导演之外？”

‘Every hotel guest—even travelling salesmen. Why, they tried to send me up a dozen candidates, but Nicole wouldn’t stand for it.’
“每一位酒店客人，甚至是旅行推销员。为什么，他们试图给我推荐十几个候选人，但妮可不同意。

Nicole reproved him when they were in their room alone. ‘Why so many highballs? Why did you use your word spic in front of him?’
当他们单独在房间里时，妮可责备了他。 ‘为什么这么多高杯酒？你为什么在他面前用辣味这个词？

‘Excuse me, I meant smoke. The tongue slipped.’
“对不起，我指的是烟。舌头滑落了。”

‘Dick, this isn’t faintly like you.’
“迪克，这有点不像你。”

‘Excuse me again. I’m not much like myself any more.’
‘再次请原谅。我不再像我自己了。

That night Dick opened a bathroom window, giving on a narrow and tubular court of the château, gray as rats but echoing at the moment to plaintive and peculiar music, sad as a flute. Two men were chanting in an Eastern language or dialect full of k’s and l’s—he leaned out but he could not see them; there was obviously a religious significance in the sounds, and tired and emotionless he let them pray for him too, but what for, save that he should not lose himself in his increasing melancholy, he did not know.
那天晚上，迪克打开浴室的窗户，看到城堡的一个狭窄的管状庭院，像老鼠一样灰色，但此刻回响着哀伤而奇特的音乐，悲伤如长笛。两个人正在用东方语言或充满k和l的方言吟诵——他探出身子，但看不到他们；这些声音显然带有宗教意义，疲惫而无情的他也让他们为他祈祷，但他不知道为什么，除了不让自己迷失在日益增长的忧郁之中。

Next day, over a thinly wooded hillside they shot scrawny birds, distant poor relations to the partridge. It was done in a vague imitation of the English manner, with a corps of inexperienced beaters whom Dick managed to miss by firing only directly overhead.
第二天，他们在一个树木稀疏的山坡上射杀了瘦骨嶙峋的鸟儿，它们是鹧鸪的远亲。这是以一种模糊地模仿英国方式进行的，由一群缺乏经验的殴打者完成，迪克只在头顶上直接开火，成功击中了他们。

On their return Lanier was waiting in their suite.
他们回来时，拉尼尔正在他们的套房里等着。

‘Father, you said tell you immediately if we were near the sick boy.’
“父亲，您说过如果我们在那个生病的男孩附近，请立即告诉您。”

Nicole whirled about, immediately on guard.
妮可转过身，立即警惕起来。

‘—so, Mother,’ Lanier continued, turning to her, ‘the boy takes a bath every evening and to-night he took his bath just before mine and I had to take mine in his water, and it was dirty.’
“——所以，妈妈，”拉尼尔转向她继续说道，“这个男孩每天晚上都洗澡，今晚他在我之前洗澡，我不得不把我的洗澡水放在他的水中，而且很脏。”

‘What? Now what?’
'什么？怎么办？'

‘I saw them take Tony out of it, and then they called me into it and the water was dirty.’
“我看到他们把托尼带了出来，然后他们把我叫进去，水很脏。”

‘But—did you take it?’
“但是——你拿走了吗？”

‘Yes, Mother.’
“是的，妈妈。”

‘Heavens!’ she exclaimed to Dick.
“天哪！”她对迪克喊道。

He demanded: ‘Why didn’t Lucienne draw your bath?’
他问道：“卢西安为什么不给你洗澡？”

‘Lucienne can’t. It’s a funny heater—it reached out of itself and burned her arm last night and she’s afraid of it, so one of those two women—‘
‘卢西安不能。这是一个有趣的加热器——昨晚它伸出来烧伤了她的手臂，她害怕它，所以那两个女人中的一个——”

‘You go in this bathroom and take a bath now.’
“你现在去这间浴室洗澡。”

‘Don’t say I told you,’ said Lanier from the doorway.
“别说我告诉过你了，”拉尼尔在门口说道。

Dick went in and sprinkled the tub with sulphur; closing the door he said to Nicole:
迪克走进去，在浴缸里撒了硫磺。关上门，他对妮可说：

‘Either we speak to Mary or we’d better get out.’
“我们要么和玛丽谈谈，要么最好离开。”

She agreed and he continued: ‘People think their children are constitutionally cleaner than other people’s, and their diseases are less contagious.’
她同意了，他继续说道：“人们认为他们的孩子本质上比其他人的孩子更干净，而且他们的疾病传染性更小。”

Dick came in and helped himself from the decanter, chewing a biscuit savagely in the rhythm of the pouring water in the bathroom.
迪克走进来，从醒酒器里拿出来，随着浴室里倒水的节奏，粗暴地嚼着一块饼干。

‘Tell Lucienne that she’s got to learn about the heater—‘ he suggested. At that moment the Asiatic woman came in person to the door.
“告诉卢西安，她必须了解加热器——”他建议道。就在这时，亚洲女人亲自来到了门口。

‘El Contessa—‘
“伯爵夫人——”

Dick beckoned her inside and closed the door.
迪克示意她进去，然后关上了门。

‘Is the little sick boy better?’ he inquired pleasantly.
“那个小男孩好点了吗？”他愉快地问道。

‘Better, yes, but he still has the eruptions frequently.’
“是的，好多了，但他还是经常喷发。”

‘That’s too bad—I’m very sorry. But you see our children mustn’t be bathed in his water. That’s out of the question—I’m sure your mistress would be furious if she had known you had done a thing like that.’
‘那太糟糕了——我非常抱歉。但你看我们的孩子绝对不能用他的水洗澡。那是不可能的——我相信如果你的女主人知道你做了这样的事，她一定会生气的。”

‘I?’ She seemed thunderstruck. ‘Why, I merely saw your maid had difficulty with the heater—I told her about it and started the water.’
“我？”她似乎惊呆了。 “哎呀，我只是看到你的女仆用暖气有困难——我告诉了她这件事，然后开始放水。”

‘But with a sick person you must empty the bathwater entirely out, and clean the tub.’
“但是对于病人来说，你必须将洗澡水完全倒空，并清洁浴缸。”

‘I?’
'我？'

Chokingly the woman drew a long breath, uttered a convulsed sob and rushed from the room.
女人哽咽地长长地吸了一口气，抽搐着抽泣着，冲出了房间。

‘She mustn’t get up on western civilization at our expense,’ he said grimly.
“她不能以牺牲我们为代价来接受西方文明，”他冷酷地说。

At dinner that night he decided that it must inevitably be a truncated visit: about his own country Hosain seemed to have observed only that there were many mountains and some goats and herders of goats. He was a reserved young man—to draw him out would have required the sincere effort that Dick now reserved for his family. Soon after dinner Hosain left Mary and the Divers to themselves, but the old unity was split—between them lay the restless social fields that Mary was about to conquer. Dick was relieved when, at nine-thirty, Mary received and read a note and got up.
那天晚上吃晚饭时，他决定这必然是一次被缩短的访问：关于他自己的国家，侯赛因似乎只注意到那里有许多山脉、一些山羊和山羊牧民。他是一个保守的年轻人——要把他拉出来需要迪克现在为他的家人所做的真诚的努力。晚餐后不久，侯赛因就让玛丽和戴弗夫妇独自一人，但旧有的团结被分裂了——他们之间存在着玛丽即将征服的不安分的社会领域。九点三十分，玛丽收到并读了一张便条并起身，迪克松了口气。

‘You’ll have to excuse me. My husband is leaving on a short trip— and I must be with him.’
‘你得原谅我。我丈夫要去一次短途旅行，我必须和他在一起。

Next morning, hard on the heels of the servant bringing coffee, Mary entered their room. She was dressed and they were not dressed, and she had the air of having been up for some time. Her face was toughened with quiet jerky fury.
第二天早上，玛丽紧随送来咖啡的仆人走进了他们的房间。她穿好了衣服，而他们却没穿衣服，看上去好像已经起床一段时间了。她的脸因安静而生涩的愤怒而变得坚韧。

‘What is this story about Lanier having been bathed in a dirty bath?’
“拉尼尔在肮脏的浴缸里洗澡的故事是什么？”

Dick began to protest, but she cut through:
迪克开始抗议，但她打断了：

‘What is this story that you commanded my husband’s sister to clean Lanier’s tub?’
“你命令我丈夫的妹妹清洁拉尼尔的浴缸，这是什么故事？”

She remained on her feet staring at them, as they sat impotent as idols in their beds, weighted by their trays. Together they exclaimed: ‘His SISTER!’
她仍然站着，盯着他们，他们像偶像一样软弱地坐在床上，托盘压得很重。他们一起喊道：“他的妹妹！”

‘That you ordered one of his sisters to clean out a tub!’
“你命令他的一个姐妹清理浴缸！”

‘We didn’t—‘ their voices rang together saying the same thing, ‘— I spoke to the native servant—‘
“我们没有——”他们的声音同时响起，说着同样的话，“——我对当地仆人说过——”

‘You spoke to Hosain’s sister.’
“你和侯赛因的妹妹说话了。”

Dick could only say: ‘I supposed they were two maids.’
迪克只能说：“我以为她们是两个女仆。”

‘You were told they were Himadoun.’
“有人告诉你他们是 Himadoun。”

‘What?’ Dick got out of bed and into a robe.
“什么？”迪克下了床，穿上长袍。

‘I explained it to you at the piano night before last. Don’t tell me you were too merry to understand.’
“前天晚上我在钢琴上向你解释过。别告诉我你太高兴了，听不懂。”

‘Was that what you said? I didn’t hear the beginning. I didn’t connect the—we didn’t make any connection, Mary. Well, all we can do is see her and apologize.’
‘是你说的吗？我没听到开头。我没有联系——我们没有建立任何联系，玛丽。好吧，我们能做的就是见她并向她道歉。”

‘See her and apologize! I explained to you that when the oldest member of the family—when the oldest one marries, well, the two oldest sisters consecrate themselves to being Himadoun, to being his wife’s ladies-in-waiting.’
‘见她并向她道歉！我向你解释过，当家里最年长的成员——当最年长的成员结婚时，两个最年长的姐妹就会奉献自己成为 Himadoun，成为他妻子的侍女。

‘Was that why Hosain left the house last night?’
“这就是侯赛因昨晚离开家的原因吗？”

Mary hesitated; then nodded.
玛丽犹豫了。然后点点头。

‘He had to—they all left. His honor makes it necessary.’
“他不得不——他们都离开了。他的荣誉使得这是必要的。

Now both the Divers were up and dressing; Mary went on:
现在两个潜水员都起床穿衣服了。玛丽继续说道：

‘And what’s all that about the bathwater. As if a thing like that could happen in this house! We’ll ask Lanier about it.’
“那洗澡水又是怎么回事呢？”好像这样的事情会发生在这个家里！我们会向拉尼尔询问此事。

Dick sat on the bedside indicating in a private gesture to Nicole that she should take over. Meanwhile Mary went to the door and spoke to an attendant in Italian.
迪克坐在床边，私下里向妮可示意她应该接手。与此同时，玛丽走到门口，用意大利语与服务员交谈。

‘Wait a minute,’ Nicole said. ‘I won’t have that.’
“等一下，”妮可说。 “我不会那样的。”

‘You accused us,’ answered Mary, in a tone she had never used to Nicole before. ‘Now I have a right to see.’
“你指责我们，”玛丽回答道，她以前从未用过对妮可的语气。 “现在我有权利看。”

‘I won’t have the child brought in.’ Nicole threw on her clothes as though they were chain mail.
“我不会把孩子带进来的。”妮可把衣服穿上，就好像它们是锁子甲一样。

‘That’s all right,’ said Dick. ‘Bring Lanier in. We’ll settle this bathtub matter—fact or myth.’
“没关系，”迪克说。 “把拉尼尔带进来。我们会解决浴缸的问题——无论是事实还是神话。”

Lanier, half clothed mentally and physically, gazed at the angered faces of the adults.
拉尼尔精神上和身体上都半裸着，凝视着大人们愤怒的脸。

‘Listen, Lanier,’ Mary demanded, ‘how did you come to think you were bathed in water that had been used before?’
“听着，拉尼尔，”玛丽问道，“你怎么会认为自己是用以前用过的水洗澡的呢？”

‘Speak up,’ Dick added.
“说出来，”迪克补充道。

‘It was just dirty, that was all.’
“只是很脏，仅此而已。”

‘Couldn’t you hear the new water running, from your room, next door?’
“你听不到隔壁房间传来的新水流声吗？”

Lanier admitted the possibility but reiterated his point—the water was dirty. He was a little awed; he tried to see ahead:
拉尼尔承认这种可能性，但重申了他的观点——水很脏。他有点敬畏；他试图展望未来：

‘It couldn’t have been running, because—‘
“它不可能一直在运行，因为——”

They pinned him down.
他们把他按倒在地。

‘Why not?’
'为什么不？'

He stood in his little kimono arousing the sympathy of his parents and further arousing Mary’s impatience—then he said:
他穿着小和服站在那里，引起了父母的同情，也引起了玛丽的不耐烦——然后他说道：

‘The water was dirty, it was full of soap-suds.’
“水很脏，充满了肥皂水。”

‘When you’re not sure what you’re saying—‘ Mary began, but Nicole interrupted.
“当你不确定自己在说什么时——”玛丽开始说道，但妮可打断了她。

‘Stop it, Mary. If there were dirty suds in the water it was logical to think it was dirty. His father told him to come—‘
‘别这样，玛丽。如果水中有肮脏的泡沫，那么我们就会合乎逻辑地认为水很脏。他父亲叫他来——”

‘There couldn’t have been dirty suds in the water.’
“水中不可能有肮脏的泡沫。”

Lanier looked reproachfully at his father, who had betrayed him. Nicole turned him about by the shoulders and sent him out of the room; Dick broke the tensity with a laugh.
拉尼尔责备地看着背叛了他的父亲。妮可抓住他的肩膀把他转了个身，把他送出了房间。迪克用笑声打破了紧张气氛。

Then, as if the sound recalled the past, the old friendship, Mary guessed how far away from them she had gone and said in a mollifying tone: ‘It’s always like that with children.’
然后，仿佛这声音让人回想起过去，回忆起昔日的友谊，玛丽猜到自己已经离他们有多远了，她用缓和的语气说道：“孩子们总是这样。”

Her uneasiness grew as she remembered the past. ‘You’d be silly to go—Hosain wanted to make this trip anyhow. After all, you’re my guests and you just blundered into the thing.’ But Dick, made more angry by this obliqueness and the use of the word blunder, turned away and began arranging his effects, saying:
回忆起往事，她的不安感与日俱增。 “你去的话就太傻了——无论如何，侯赛因都想去。”毕竟，你们是我的客人，而你们只是不小心闯入了这件事。”但是迪克因为这种含糊其词和“失误”这个词的使用而更加生气，他转过身去，开始整理他的物品，说道：

‘It’s too bad about the young women. I’d like to apologize to the one who came in here.’
“对于年轻女性来说这太糟糕了。我想向进来的人道歉。

‘If you’d only listened on the piano seat!’
“如果你只坐在钢琴座位上听就好了！”

‘But you’ve gotten so damned dull, Mary. I listened as long as I could.’
“但是你已经变得太迟钝了，玛丽。我尽可能长时间地倾听。

‘Be quiet!’ Nicole advised him.
“安静点！”妮可劝告他。

‘I return his compliment,’ said Mary bitterly. ‘Good-by, Nicole.’ She went out.
“我回应他的赞美，”玛丽苦涩地说。 “再见，妮可。”她出去了。

After all that there was no question of her coming to see them off; the major-domo arranged the departure. Dick left formal notes for Hosain and the sisters. There was nothing to do except to go, but all of them, especially Lanier, felt bad about it.
毕竟，她来送行是毫无疑问的。管家安排了出发。迪克给侯赛因和姐妹们留下了正式的笔记。除了走之外，也没什么事可做，但所有人，尤其是拉尼尔，都觉得不妙。

‘I insist,’ insisted Lanier on the train, ‘that it was dirty bathwater.’
“我坚持认为，”拉尼尔在火车上坚持说，“那是肮脏的洗澡水。”

‘That’ll do,’ his father said. ‘You better forget it—unless you want me to divorce you. Did you know there was a new law in France that you can divorce a child?’
“那就行了，”他父亲说。 “你最好忘记这件事——除非你想让我跟你离婚。”你知道法国有一项新法律规定你可以与孩子离婚吗？

Lanier roared with delight and the Divers were unified again—Dick wondered how many more times it could be done.
拉尼尔高兴地咆哮，戴弗队再次团结起来——迪克想知道这样的事情还能做多少次。

Nicole went to the window and bent over the sill to take a look at the rising altercation on the terrace; the April sun shone pink on the saintly face of Augustine, the cook, and blue on the butcher’s knife she waved in her drunken hand. She had been with them since their return to Villa Diana in February.
妮可走到窗前，俯身在窗台上，看看露台上愈演愈烈的争吵。四月的阳光在厨师奥古斯丁圣洁的脸上闪耀着粉红色的光芒，在她醉酒手中挥舞的屠刀上也闪耀着蓝色的光芒。自从二月份他们回到戴安娜别墅以来，她就一直和他们在一起。

Because of an obstruction of an awning she could see only Dick’s head and his hand holding one of his heavy canes with a bronze knob on it. The knife and the cane, menacing each other, were like tripos and short sword in a gladiatorial combat. Dick’s words reached her first:
由于遮阳篷的阻挡，她只能看到迪克的头，他的手握着一根沉重的手杖，手杖上有一个青铜旋钮。刀与杖，互相威胁，就像角斗中的三刀和短剑。她首先听到迪克的话：

‘—care how much kitchen wine you drink but when I find you digging into a bottle of Chablis Moutonne—‘
“——关心你喝了多少厨房酒，但当我发现你正在喝一瓶夏布利木桐酒——”

‘You talk about drinking!’ Augustine cried, flourishing her sabre. ‘You drink—all the time!’
“你说喝酒！”奥古斯丁挥舞着军刀喊道。 “你一直喝酒！”

Nicole called over the awning: ‘What’s the matter, Dick?’ and he answered in English:
妮可在遮阳篷上喊道：“怎么了，迪克？”他用英语回答：

‘The old girl has been polishing off the vintage wines. I’m firing her—at least I’m trying to.’
‘老姑娘正在把陈年的葡萄酒擦干净。我要解雇她——至少我正在努力这样做。

‘Heavens! Well, don’t let her reach you with that knife.’
'天！好吧，别让她用那把刀碰到你。”

Augustine shook her knife up at Nicole. Her old mouth was made of two small intersecting cherries.
奥古斯丁向妮可挥舞着刀。她的旧嘴是由两颗相互交叉的小樱桃组成的。

‘I would like to say, Madame, if you knew that your husband drinks over at his Bastide comparatively as a day-laborer—‘
“我想说，夫人，如果您知道您的丈夫在他的庄园里喝酒，相对来说就像是临时工一样——”

‘Shut up and get out!’ interrupted Nicole. ‘We’ll get the gendarmes.’
“闭嘴，出去！”妮可打断道。 “我们会派出宪兵。”

‘YOU’LL get the gendarmes! With my brother in the corps! You—a disgusting American?’
‘你会得到宪兵的！和我哥哥一起在部队！你——一个令人厌恶的美国人？

In English Dick called up to Nicole:
迪克用英语呼叫妮可：

‘Get the children away from the house till I settle this.’
“在我解决这件事之前，让孩子们离开家。”

‘—disgusting Americans who come here and drink up our finest wines,’ screamed Augustine with the voice of the commune.
“——令人厌恶的美国人来到这里喝我们最好的葡萄酒，”奥古斯丁用公社的声音尖叫道。

Dick mastered a firmer tone.
迪克掌握了更坚定的语气。

‘You must leave now! I’ll pay you what we owe you.’
‘你现在必须离开！我会偿还我们欠你的钱。

‘Very sure you’ll pay me! And let me tell you—‘ she came close and waved the knife so furiously that Dick raised his stick, whereupon she rushed into the kitchen and returned with the carving knife reinforced by a hatchet.
‘非常确定你会付钱给我！让我告诉你——”她走近了，疯狂地挥舞着刀子，迪克举起了棍子，于是她冲进厨房，带着用斧头加固的切肉刀回来了。

The situation was not prepossessing—Augustine was a strong woman and could be disarmed only at the risk of serious results to herself—and severe legal complications which were the lot of one who molested a French citizen. Trying a bluff Dick called up to Nicole:
情况并不令人乐观——奥古斯丁是一位坚强的女人，只有冒着给自己带来严重后果的风险才能解除武装——而且猥亵法国公民的人也会面临严重的法律纠纷。试图虚张声势迪克打电话给妮可：

‘Phone the poste de police.’ Then to Augustine, indicating her armament, ‘This means arrest for you.’
“给警察局打电话。”然后对奥古斯丁指着她的武器，“这意味着你会被逮捕。”

‘Ha-HA!’ she laughed demoniacally; nevertheless she came no nearer. Nicole phoned the police but was answered with what was almost an echo of Augustine’s laugh. She heard mumbles and passings of the word around—the connection was suddenly broken.
“哈哈！”她恶魔般地笑道。尽管如此，她还是没有走近。妮可给警察打电话，但得到的答复几乎是奥古斯丁的笑声。她听到周围传来咕哝声和传话声——联系突然中断了。

Returning to the window she called down to Dick: ‘Give her something extra!’
回到窗前，她对迪克喊道：“给她一些额外的东西！”

‘If I could get to that phone!’ As this seemed impracticable, Dick capitulated. For fifty francs, increased to a hundred as he succumbed to the idea of getting her out hastily, Augustine yielded her fortress, covering the retreat with stormy grenades of ‘Salaud!’ She would leave only when her nephew could come for her baggage. Waiting cautiously in the neighborhood of the kitchen Dick heard a cork pop, but he yielded the point. There was no further trouble—when the nephew arrived, all apologetic, Augustine bade Dick a cheerful, convivial good-by and called up ‘All revoir, Madame! Bonne chance!’ to Nicole’s window.
“如果我能拿到那部电话就好了！”由于这似乎不切实际，迪克屈服了。为了让她赶紧出去，奥古斯丁花了五十法郎，后来又增加到了一百法郎，他放弃了她的堡垒，用“万岁！”的暴风雨手榴弹掩护撤退，只有当她的侄子可以来拿她的行李时，她才会离开。迪克在厨房附近小心翼翼地等待着，听到了软木塞的爆裂声，但他还是放弃了要点。没有再发生什么麻烦——当侄子带着歉意到来时，奥古斯丁愉快地向迪克道别，并喊道：“再见，夫人！”好机会！”对着妮可的窗户说道。

The Divers went to Nice and dined on a bouillabaisse, which is a stew of rock fish and small lobsters, highly seasoned with saffron, and a bottle of cold Chablis. He expressed pity for Augustine.
潜水员们去了尼斯，吃了一份马赛鱼汤，这是一种用岩鱼和小龙虾炖的菜，用藏红花调味，还有一瓶冷夏布利酒。他对奥古斯丁表示同情。

‘I’m not sorry a bit,’ said Nicole.
“我一点也不抱歉，”妮可说。

‘I’m sorry—and yet I wish I’d shoved her over the cliff.’
“我很抱歉——但我希望我把她推下了悬崖。”

There was little they dared talk about in these days; seldom did they find the right word when it counted, it arrived always a moment too late when one could not reach the other any more. Tonight Augustine’s outburst had shaken them from their separate reveries; with the burn and chill of the spiced broth and the parching wine they talked.
这些天来，他们几乎不敢谈论什么。他们很少能在关键时刻找到正确的词语，总是来得太迟，以至于一个人无法再联系到另一个人。今晚，奥古斯丁的爆发让他们从各自的遐想中惊醒。他们谈论着辛辣的肉汤和干酒的灼热和寒冷。

‘We can’t go on like this,’ Nicole suggested. ‘Or can we?—what do you think?’ Startled that for the moment Dick did not deny it, she continued, ‘Some of the time I think it’s my fault—I’ve ruined you.’
“我们不能再这样下去了，”妮可建议道。 “或者我们可以吗？——你觉得怎么样？”令她惊讶的是，迪克暂时没有否认这一点，她继续说道，“有时我认为这是我的错——我毁了你。”

‘So I’m ruined, am I?’ he inquired pleasantly.
“那么我就破产了，是吗？”他愉快地问道。

‘I didn’t mean that. But you used to want to create things—now you seem to want to smash them up.’
‘我不是那个意思。但你曾经想要创造一些东西——现在你似乎想要粉碎它们。”

She trembled at criticizing him in these broad terms—but his enlarging silence frightened her even more. She guessed that something was developing behind the silence, behind the hard, blue eyes, the almost unnatural interest in the children. Uncharacteristic bursts of temper surprised her—he would suddenly unroll a long scroll of contempt for some person, race, class, way of life, way of thinking. It was as though an incalculable story was telling itself inside him, about which she could only guess at in the moments when it broke through the surface.
她因用如此宽泛的措辞批评他而颤抖——但他越来越沉默让她更害怕。她猜想，在沉默的背后、在冷漠的蓝眼睛背后、在对孩子们近乎不自然的兴趣背后，正在酝酿着某种东西。反常的脾气爆发让她感到惊讶——他会突然展开一长卷，蔑视某个人、种族、阶级、生活方式、思维方式。仿佛有一个无法估量的故事正在他内心讲述，而她只能在故事破灭的那一刻猜测。

‘After all, what do you get out of this?’ she demanded.
“毕竟，你能从中得到什么？”她问道。

‘Knowing you’re stronger every day. Knowing that your illness follows the law of diminishing returns.’
‘知道你每天都变得更坚强。知道你的疾病遵循收益递减规律。

His voice came to her from far off, as though he were speaking of something remote and academic; her alarm made her exclaim, ‘Dick!’ and she thrust her hand forward to his across the table. A reflex pulled Dick’s hand back and he added: ‘There’s the whole situation to think of, isn’t there? There’s not just you.’ He covered her hand with his and said in the old pleasant voice of a conspirator for pleasure, mischief, profit, and delight:
他的声音从很远的地方传来，仿佛在谈论一些遥远而学术的事情。她惊慌失措地喊道：“迪克！”然后她把手伸向桌子对面的他。迪克本能地把手收回来，补充道：“整个情况都需要考虑，不是吗？”不仅仅是你。”他用自己的手捂住了她的手，用一种古老而愉快的声音说道：

‘See that boat out there?’
“看到外面那艘船了吗？”

It was the motor yacht of T. F. Golding lying placid among the little swells of the Nicean Bay, constantly bound upon a romantic voyage that was not dependent upon actual motion. ‘We’ll go out there now and ask the people on board what’s the matter with them. We’ll find out if they’re happy.’
这是T.F.戈尔丁的机动游艇，平静地躺在尼西亚湾的小浪中，不断地进行着不依赖于实际运动的浪漫航行。 “我们现在就去那里询问船上的人怎么了。我们会知道他们是否高兴。

‘We hardly know him,’ Nicole objected.
“我们几乎不认识他，”妮可反对道。

‘He urged us. Besides, Baby knows him—she practically married him, doesn’t she—didn’t she?’
‘他催促我们。而且，宝贝认识他——她几乎嫁给了他，不是吗——不是吗？

When they put out from the port in a hired launch it was already summer dusk and lights were breaking out in spasms along the rigging of the Margin. As they drew up alongside, Nicole’s doubts reasserted themselves.
当他们乘坐一艘租用的汽艇从港口出发时，已经是夏季的黄昏了，边缘号的索具上灯光突然亮起。当他们靠边停车时，妮可的疑虑再次出现。

‘He’s having a party—‘
“他正在开派对——”

‘It’s only a radio,’ he guessed.
“这只是一台收音机，”他猜测道。

They were hailed—a huge white-haired man in a white suit looked down at them, calling:
他们受到欢呼——一名身着白色西装的白发大汉俯视着他们，喊道：

‘Do I recognize the Divers?’
“我认识潜水员吗？”

‘Boat ahoy, Margin!’
“船呀，马瑞恩！”

Their boat moved under the companionway; as they mounted Golding doubled his huge frame to give Nicole a hand.
他们的船在升降梯下移动；当他们上马时，戈尔丁将他巨大的身躯加倍，以帮助妮可。

‘Just in time for dinner.’
“正好赶上吃晚饭。”

A small orchestra was playing astern.
船尾有一支小型管弦乐队正在演奏。

‘I’m yours for the asking—but till then you can’t ask me to behave—‘
“只要你提出要求，我就是你的——但在那之前你不能要求我表现得好——”

And as Golding’s cyclonic arms blew them aft without touching them, Nicole was sorrier they had come, and more impatient at Dick. Having taken up an attitude of aloofness from the gay people here, at the time when Dick’s work and her health were incompatible with going about, they had a reputation as refusers. Riviera replacements during the ensuing years interpreted this as a vague unpopularity. Nevertheless, having taken such a stand, Nicole felt it should not be cheaply compromised for a momentary selfindulgence.
当戈尔丁的旋风手臂将他们吹到船尾却没有碰到他们时，妮可对他们的到来感到更加遗憾，对迪克也更加不耐烦。当迪克的工作和她的健康状况不相容时，他们对这里的同性恋者采取了冷漠的态度，因此享有拒绝者的名声。在接下来的几年里，里维埃拉的替代者将此解释为一种模糊的不受欢迎的情况。然而，既然采取了这样的立场，妮可就觉得不应该为了一时的自我放纵而轻易妥协。

As they passed through the principal salon they saw ahead of them figures that seemed to dance in the half light of the circular stern. This was an illusion made by the enchantment of the music, the unfamiliar lighting, and the surrounding presence of water. Actually, save for some busy stewards, the guests loafed on a wide divan that followed the curve of the deck. There were a white, a red, a blurred dress, the laundered chests of several men, of whom one, detaching and identifying himself, brought from Nicole a rare little cry of delight.
当他们穿过主沙龙时，他们看到前面有一些人影，似乎在圆形船尾的半光中跳舞。这是由迷人的音乐、陌生的灯光和周围的水所造成的幻觉。事实上，除了一些忙碌的乘务员之外，客人们都在沿着甲板曲线的宽大沙发上闲逛。有一件白色的、一件红色的、模糊的衣服，几个男人洗过的胸部，其中一个人，分离并表明了自己的身份，从妮可那里引来了罕见的喜悦的小叫声。

‘Tommy!’
“汤米！”

Brushing aside the Gallicism of his formal dip at her hand, Nicole pressed her face against his. They sat, or rather lay down together on the Antoninian bench. His handsome face was so dark as to have lost the pleasantness of deep tan, without attaining the blue beauty of Negroes—it was just worn leather. The foreignness of his depigmentation by unknown suns, his nourishment by strange soils, his tongue awkward with the curl of many dialects, his reactions attuned to odd alarms—these things fascinated and rested Nicole—in the moment of meeting she lay on his bosom, spiritually, going out and out... . Then self-preservation reasserted itself and retiring to her own world she spoke lightly.
妮可撇开他正式握手时的法国式礼仪，把脸贴在他的脸上。他们坐在，或者更确切地说，一起躺在安东尼的长凳上。他英俊的脸是如此的黑，失去了深棕褐色的愉悦感，没有达到黑人的蓝色美——它只是破旧的皮革。他因未知的太阳而褪色，他因陌生的土壤而变得陌生，他的舌头因许多方言的卷曲而显得笨拙，他对奇怪警报的反应协调一致——这些东西让妮可着迷并休息了——在见面的那一刻，她躺在他的怀里，精神上，走出去，走出去……然后自我保护又恢复了，回到了自己的世界，她轻声说道。

‘You look just like all the adventurers in the movies—but why do you have to stay away so long?’
“你看起来就像电影里的所有冒险家一样——但为什么你要离开这么久呢？”

Tommy Barban looked at her, uncomprehending but alert; the pupils of his eyes flashed.
汤米·巴尔班看着她，不解但警惕。他眼眸闪烁。

‘Five years,’ she continued, in throaty mimicry of nothing. ‘MUCH too long. Couldn’t you only slaughter a certain number of creatures and then come back, and breathe our air for a while?’
“五年了，”她继续说道，声音嘶哑，什么也没有。 ‘太长了。难道你不能只杀掉一定数量的生物然后回来，呼吸我们的空气一段时间吗？

In her cherished presence Tommy Europeanized himself quickly.
在她珍贵的存在下，汤米很快就欧洲化了。

‘Mais pour nous héros,’ he said, ‘il nous faut du temps, Nicole. Nous ne pouvons pas faire de petits exercises d’héroisme—il faut faire les grandes compositions.’
“Mais pour nous héros，”他说，“il nous faut du temps，妮可。” Nous ne pouvons pas faire de petits attempts d’héroisme——il faut faire les grandes ideas。

‘Talk English to me, Tommy.’
“跟我说英语，汤米。”

‘Parlez français avec moi, Nicole.’
“Parlez français avec moi，妮可。”

‘But the meanings are different—in French you can be heroic and gallant with dignity, and you know it. But in English you can’t be heroic and gallant without being a little absurd, and you know that too. That gives me an advantage.’
“但含义不同——在法语中，你可以表现出英雄气概、英勇有尊严，你知道这一点。但在英语中，你不可能表现出英雄气概而不显得有点荒唐，你也知道这一点。这给了我一个优势。

‘But after all—‘ He chuckled suddenly. ‘Even in English I’m brave, heroic and all that.’
“但毕竟——”他突然轻笑起来。 “即使在英语中，我也很勇敢、英雄等等。”

She pretended to be groggy with wonderment but he was not abashed.
她假装因惊奇而昏昏沉沉，但他并不感到羞愧。

‘I only know what I see in the cinema,’ he said.
“我只知道我在电影院里看到的东西，”他说。

‘Is it all like the movies?’
“一切都像电影里那样吗？”

‘The movies aren’t so bad—now this Ronald Colman—have you seen his pictures about the Corps d’Afrique du Nord? They’re not bad at all.’
“电影还不错——现在是罗纳德·科尔曼——你看过他关于北非军团的照片吗？”他们一点也不坏。

‘Very well, whenever I go to the movies I’ll know you’re going through just that sort of thing at that moment.’
“很好，每当我去看电影时，我就会知道你当时正在经历这样的事情。”

As she spoke, Nicole was aware of a small, pale, pretty young woman with lovely metallic hair, almost green in the deck lights, who had been sitting on the other side of Tommy and might have been part either of their conversation or of the one next to them. She had obviously had a monopoly of Tommy, for now she abandoned hope of his attention with what was once called ill grace, and petulantly crossed the crescent of the deck.
当她说话的时候，妮可注意到一个身材矮小、苍白、漂亮的年轻女子，她有一头可爱的金属色头发，在甲板灯光下几乎是绿色的，她一直坐在汤米的另一边，可能参与了他们的谈话或谈话。他们旁边有一个。她显然已经垄断了汤米，现在她以曾经被称为恶意的方式放弃了引起他注意的希望，脾气暴躁地穿过了新月形的甲板。

‘After all, I am a hero,’ Tommy said calmly, only half joking. ‘I have ferocious courage, US-ually, something like a lion, something like a drunken man.’
“毕竟，我是英雄。”汤米半开玩笑地平静地说。 “我有凶猛的勇气，美国通常的勇气，就像一头狮子，就像一个醉汉。”

Nicole waited until the echo of his boast had died away in his mind—she knew he had probably never made such a statement before. Then she looked among the strangers, and found as usual, the fierce neurotics, pretending calm, liking the country only in horror of the city, of the sound of their own voices which had set the tone and pitch... . She asked:
妮可一直等到他的夸耀的回声在他脑海中消失——她知道他以前可能从未说过这样的话。然后她在陌生人中间看了看，发现像往常一样，都是激烈的神经症患者，假装平静，喜欢乡村，只是因为害怕城市，害怕他们自己的声音，而这些声音定下了基调和音调……。她问：

‘Who is the woman in white?’
“那个白衣女子是谁？”

‘The one who was beside me? Lady Caroline Sibly-Biers.’—They listened for a moment to her voice across the way:
‘就在我身边的那个人？卡罗琳·西布莉-比尔斯女士。”——他们听了一会儿她对面的声音：

‘The man’s a scoundrel, but he’s a cat of the stripe. We sat up all night playing two-handed chemin-de-fer, and he owes me a mille Swiss.’
“这个人是个恶棍，但他也是一只正派的猫。”我们整晚都在玩双手棋，他欠我一百万瑞士币。”

Tommy laughed and said: ‘She is now the wickedest woman in London— whenever I come back to Europe there is a new crop of the wickedest women from London. She’s the very latest—though I believe there is now one other who’s considered almost as wicked.’
汤米笑着说：“她现在是伦敦最邪恶的女人了——每当我回到欧洲，都会看到来自伦敦的新一批最邪恶的女人。”她是最新的一个——尽管我相信现在还有一个几乎被认为是同样邪恶的人。

Nicole glanced again at the woman across the deck—she was fragile, tubercular—it was incredible that such narrow shoulders, such puny arms could bear aloft the pennon of decadence, last ensign of the fading empire. Her resemblance was rather to one of John Held’s flat-chested flappers than to the hierarchy of tall languid blondes who had posed for painters and novelists since before the war.
妮可又看了一眼甲板对面的女人——她很脆弱，患有结核病——令人难以置信的是，如此狭窄的肩膀、如此纤弱的手臂竟然能够高举颓废的三角旗，这是衰落帝国的最后一面旗帜。她更像约翰·赫尔德笔下的一位平胸时髦女郎，而不是战前为画家和小说家摆出姿势的高个子、慵懒的金发女郎。

Golding approached, fighting down the resonance of his huge bulk, which transmitted his will as through a gargantuan amplifier, and Nicole, still reluctant, yielded to his reiterated points: that the Margin was starting for Cannes immediately after dinner; that they could always pack in some caviare and champagne, even though they had dined; that in any case Dick was now on the phone, telling their chauffeur in Nice to drive their car back to Cannes and leave it in front of the Café des Alliées where the Divers could retrieve it.
戈尔丁走近了，他压低了自己巨大身躯的共振，这种共振就像通过一个巨大的放大器传递了他的意志，而妮可仍然不情愿，屈服于他重申的观点：边缘在晚餐后立即出发前往戛纳；即使他们已经吃过饭，他们也可以随时带上一些鱼子酱和香槟；不管怎样，迪克现在正在打电话，告诉他们在尼斯的司机把车开回戛纳，把车停在联盟咖啡馆门口，戴弗斯可以在那里取回车。

They moved into the dining salon and Dick was placed next to Lady Sibly-Biers. Nicole saw that his usually ruddy face was drained of blood; he talked in a dogmatic voice, of which only snatches reached Nicole:
他们搬进了餐厅，迪克被安排在西比尔斯夫人旁边。妮可看到他平时红润的脸已经没有血色了。他用一种教条的语气说话，妮可只听到了一些片段：

‘... It’s all right for you English, you’re doing a dance of death... . Sepoys in the ruined fort, I mean Sepoys at the gate and gaiety in the fort and all that. The green hat, the crushed hat, no future.’
“……对你们英国人来说没关系，你们正在跳死亡之舞……”被毁坏的堡垒里的塞波伊，我指的是门口的塞波伊和堡垒里的欢乐等等。绿帽子，压碎的帽子，没有未来。

Lady Caroline answered him in short sentences spotted with the terminal ‘What?’ the double-edged ‘Quite!’ the depressing ‘Cheerio!’ that always had a connotation of imminent peril, but Dick appeared oblivious to the warning signals. Suddenly he made a particularly vehement pronouncement, the purport of which eluded Nicole, but she saw the young woman turn dark and sinewy, and heard her answer sharply:
卡罗琳夫人用简短的句子回答了他，最后的“什么？”，双刃剑的“相当！”和令人沮丧的“Cheerio！”总是暗示着迫在眉睫的危险，但迪克似乎没有注意到这些警告信号。突然，他发出了一个特别激烈的声明，妮可听不懂其要旨，但她看到年轻女子脸色黝黑，肌肉发达，并听到她尖锐的回答：

‘After all a chep’s a chep and a chum’s a chum.’
“毕竟，小伙子就是小伙子，朋友就是朋友。”

Again he had offended some one—couldn’t he hold his tongue a little longer? How long? To death then.
他又得罪人了，他的嘴就不能再闭嘴一点吗？多久？那就去死吧。

At the piano, a fair-haired young Scotsman from the orchestra (entitled by its drum ‘The Ragtime College Jazzes of Edinboro’) had begun singing in a Danny Deever monotone, accompanying himself with low chords on the piano. He pronounced his words with great precision, as though they impressed him almost intolerably.
钢琴前，管弦乐队（以鼓名为“爱丁伯勒拉格泰姆学院爵士乐队”）的一位金发年轻苏格兰人开始用丹尼·迪弗的单调歌唱，并在钢琴上用低沉的和弦伴奏。他说的话非常精确，仿佛它们给他留下了几乎难以忍受的印象。

“There was a young lady from hell,
“有一位来自地狱的年轻女士，

Who jumped at the sound of a bell,
谁一听到钟声就跳了起来，

Because she was bad—bad—bad,
因为她很糟糕——很糟糕——很糟糕，

She jumped at the sound of a bell,
一听到铃声她就跳了起来

From hell (BOOMBOOM)
来自地狱（轰隆隆）

From hell (TOOTTOOT)
来自地狱（嘟嘟）

There was a young lady from hell—‘
有一位来自地狱的年轻女士——’

‘What is all this?’ whispered Tommy to Nicole.
“这到底是怎么回事？”汤米低声对妮可说道。

The girl on the other side of him supplied the answer:
对面的女孩给出了答案：

‘Caroline Sibly-Biers wrote the words. He wrote the music.’
卡罗琳·西布利-比尔斯写下了这句话。他写了音乐。

‘Quelle enfanterie!’ Tommy murmured as the next verse began, hinting at the jumpy lady’s further predilections. ‘On dirait qu’il récite Racine!’
“Quelle enfanterie！”下一节开始时汤米低声说道，暗示了这位神经质的女士的进一步偏好。 “On dirait qu'il récite Racine！”

On the surface at least, Lady Caroline was paying no attention to the performance of her work. Glancing at her again Nicole found herself impressed, neither with the character nor the personality, but with the sheer strength derived from an attitude; Nicole thought that she was formidable, and she was confirmed in this point of view as the party rose from table. Dick remained in his seat wearing an odd expression; then he crashed into words with a harsh ineptness.
至少从表面上看，卡罗琳夫人并没有在意她的工作表现。妮可再次看了她一眼，发现自己印象深刻，不是因为她的性格，也不是因为她的个性，而是因为她的态度所带来的纯粹的力量；妮可认为她很强大，当大家从餐桌上起身时，她也证实了这一点。迪克仍然坐在座位上，表情古怪。然后他突然粗鲁地说话了。

‘I don’t like innuendo in these deafening English whispers.’
“我不喜欢这些震耳欲聋的英国低语中的影射。”

Already half-way out of the room Lady Caroline turned and walked back to him; she spoke in a low clipped voice purposely audible to the whole company.
卡罗琳夫人已经走出房间一半了，转身走回他身边。她故意用低沉、削促的声音说话，让整个公司都听得到。

‘You came to me asking for it—disparaging my countrymen, disparaging my friend, Mary Minghetti. I simply said you were observed associating with a questionable crowd in Lausanne. Is that a deafening whisper? Or does it simply deafen YOU?’
“你来找我是自找的——贬低我的同胞，贬低我的朋友玛丽·明盖蒂。我只是说你被发现在洛桑与一群可疑的人群交往。这是震耳欲聋的耳语吗？或者它只是让你聋了？

‘It’s still not loud enough,’ said Dick, a little too late. ‘So I am actually a notorious—‘
“声音还不够大，”迪克说，但有点太晚了。 “所以我实际上是一个臭名昭著的——”

Golding crushed out the phrase with his voice saying:
戈尔丁用他的声音压垮了这句话：

‘What! What!’ and moved his guests on out, with the threat of his powerful body. Turning the corner of the door Nicole saw that Dick was still sitting at the table. She was furious at the woman for her preposterous statement, equally furious at Dick for having brought them here, for having become fuddled, for having untipped the capped barbs of his irony, for having come off humiliated—she was a little more annoyed because she knew that her taking possession of Tommy Barban on their arrival had first irritated the Englishwoman.
'什么！什么！”并以他强大的身体威胁将他的客人们赶了出去。转过门角，妮可看到迪克仍然坐在桌边。她对那个女人的荒谬言论感到愤怒，同样对迪克感到愤怒，因为迪克把他们带到这里来，因为他变得糊涂了，因为他揭开了讽刺的倒刺，因为他受到了羞辱——她更生气一点，因为她他们知道，在他们到达时，她占有了汤米·巴尔班，这首先激怒了这个英国女人。

A moment later she saw Dick standing in the gangway, apparently in complete control of himself as he talked with Golding; then for half an hour she did not see him anywhere about the deck and she broke out of an intricate Malay game, played with string and coffee beans, and said to Tommy:
过了一会儿，她看到迪克站在舷梯上，显然在与戈尔丁交谈时完全控制住了自己。然后半个小时，她在甲板上的任何地方都没有看到他，她中断了一场复杂的马来游戏，玩起了绳子和咖啡豆，并对汤米说：

‘I’ve got to find Dick.’
“我必须找到迪克。”

Since dinner the yacht had been in motion westward. The fine night streamed away on either side, the Diesel engines pounded softly, there was a spring wind that blew Nicole’s hair abruptly when she reached the bow, and she had a sharp lesion of anxiety at seeing Dick standing in the angle by the flagstaff. His voice was serene as he recognized her.
晚餐后，游艇就一直向西行驶。晴朗的夜色从两边渐渐远去，柴油发动机轻轻地轰鸣着，当妮可到达船头时，一阵春风突然吹起了她的头发，当她看到迪克站在旗杆的角落时，她感到一阵强烈的焦虑。他认出了她，声音很平静。

‘It’s a nice night.’
“这是一个美好的夜晚。”

‘I was worried.’
'我很担心。'

‘Oh, you were worried?’
“哦，你担心吗？”

‘Oh, don’t talk that way. It would give me so much pleasure to think of a little something I could do for you, Dick.’
‘哦，别这样说话。想到能为你做点什么，迪克，我会感到非常高兴。”

He turned away from her, toward the veil of starlight over Africa.
他转身离开她，面向非洲上空的星光面纱。

‘I believe that’s true, Nicole. And sometimes I believe that the littler it was, the more pleasure it would give you.’
“我相信这是真的，妮可。有时我相信它越小，它给你带来的快乐就越多。

‘Don’t talk like that—don’t say such things.’
“别那样说话——别说这样的话。”

His face, wan in the light that the white spray caught and tossed back to the brilliant sky had none of the lines of annoyance she had expected. It was even detached; his eyes focussed upon her gradually as upon a chessman to be moved; in the same slow manner he caught her wrist and drew her near.
他的脸在白色浪花捕捉到的光线下显得苍白，然后又被抛回灿烂的天空，没有任何她想象中的恼怒的表情。它甚至是超脱的。他的目光逐渐集中在她身上，就像一个待动的棋子一样。他以同样缓慢的方式抓住她的手腕，将她拉近。

‘You ruined me, did you?’ he inquired blandly. ‘Then we’re both ruined. So—‘
“你毁了我，是吗？”他温和地问道。 ‘那么我们就都毁了。所以-'

Cold with terror she put her other wrist into his grip. All right, she would go with him—again she felt the beauty of the night vividly in one moment of complete response and abnegation—all right, then—
她惊恐万状，将另一只手腕握在他的手里。好吧，她就跟他一起去——在完全回应和放弃的那一刻，她再次生动地感受到了夜晚的美丽——好吧，那么——

—but now she was unexpectedly free and Dick turned his back sighing. ‘Tch! tch!’
——但现在她意外地自由了，迪克叹了口气转过身去。 ‘切！切！’

Tears streamed down Nicole’s face—in a moment she heard some one approaching; it was Tommy.
泪水从妮可的脸上流了下来——一会儿她听到有人走近；她听见有人走近。是汤米。

‘You found him! Nicole thought maybe you jumped overboard, Dick,’ he said, ‘because that little English poule slanged you.’
‘你找到他了！妮可认为你可能跳水了，迪克，”他说，“因为那个英国小家伙辱骂了你。”

‘It’d be a good setting to jump overboard,’ said Dick mildly.
“这是跳船的好地方，”迪克温和地说。

‘Wouldn’t it?’ agreed Nicole hastily. ‘Let’s borrow lifepreservers and jump over. I think we should do something spectacular. I feel that all our lives have been too restrained.’
“不是吗？”妮可急忙表示同意。 “我们借个救生圈跳过去吧。”我认为我们应该做一些引人注目的事情。我觉得我们的生活都太克制了。

Tommy sniffed from one to the other trying to breathe in the situation with the night. ‘We’ll go ask the Lady Beer-and-Ale what to do—she should know the latest things. And we should memorize her song ‘There was a young lady from l’enfer.’ I shall translate it, and make a fortune from its success at the Casino.’
汤米从一个嗅到另一个，试图呼吸夜晚的情况。 “我们去问问啤酒女士该怎么办——她应该知道最新的事情。我们应该记住她的歌曲“There was a young lady from l'enfer”。我会翻译它，并从它在赌场的成功中赚到一大笔钱。

‘Are you rich, Tommy?’ Dick asked him, as they retraced the length of the boat.
“汤米，你有钱吗？”当他们沿着船的长度往回走时，迪克问他。

‘Not as things go now. I got tired of the brokerage business and went away. But I have good stocks in the hands of friends who are holding it for me. All goes well.’
‘不像现在的情况。我厌倦了经纪业务并离开了。但我的朋友手里有好股票，他们帮我持有。一切顺利。

‘Dick’s getting rich,’ Nicole said. In reaction her voice had begun to tremble.
“迪克越来越富有了，”妮可说。作为回应，她的声音开始颤抖。

On the after deck Golding had fanned three pairs of dancers into action with his colossal paws. Nicole and Tommy joined them and Tommy remarked: ‘Dick seems to be drinking.’
在后甲板上，戈尔丁用他巨大的爪子扇动了三对舞者。妮可和汤米加入了他们，汤米说：“迪克似乎喝醉了。”

‘Only moderately,’ she said loyally.
“只是适度，”她忠诚地说。

‘There are those who can drink and those who can’t. Obviously Dick can’t. You ought to tell him not to.’
‘有能喝酒的人，也有不能喝酒的人。显然迪克不能。你应该告诉他不要这样做。

‘I!’ she exclaimed in amazement. ‘I tell Dick what he should do or shouldn’t do!’
“我！”她惊讶地喊道。 “我告诉迪克他应该做什么或不应该做什么！”

But in a reticent way Dick was still vague and sleepy when they reached the pier at Cannes. Golding buoyed him down into the launch of the Margin whereupon Lady Caroline shifted her place conspicuously. On the dock he bowed good-by with exaggerated formality, and for a moment he seemed about to speed her with a salty epigram, but the bone of Tommy’s arm went into the soft part of his and they walked to the attendant car.
但当他们到达戛纳码头时，迪克仍然含糊其辞、昏昏欲睡。戈尔丁把他扶到了边缘号的下水道上，随后卡罗琳女士明显地改变了位置。在码头上，他以夸张的礼节向她鞠躬告别，有那么一会儿，他似乎想用一句尖刻的警句催促她，但汤米手臂的骨头刺进了他柔软的部分，他们走向服务员的车。

‘I’ll drive you home,’ Tommy suggested.
“我开车送你回家，”汤米建议道。

‘Don’t bother—we can get a cab.’
“不用费心了——我们可以叫一辆出租车。”

‘I’d like to, if you can put me up.’
“如果你能安排我的话，我愿意。”

On the back seat of the car Dick remained quiescent until the yellow monolith of Golfe Juan was passed, and then the constant carnival at Juan les Pins where the night was musical and strident in many languages. When the car turned up the hill toward Tarmes, he sat up suddenly, prompted by the tilt of the vehicle and delivered a peroration:
迪克在汽车后座上一动不动，直到经过胡安湾的黄色巨石，然后是胡安莱潘的持续狂欢，夜晚充满音乐气息，用多种语言表达着刺耳的声音。当车子向塔尔梅斯方向驶上山坡时，他在车辆倾斜的推动下猛地坐了起来，发表了结语：

‘A charming representative of the—‘ he stumbled momentarily, ‘—a firm of—bring me Brains addled a l’Anglaise.’ Then he went into an appeased sleep, belching now and then contentedly into the soft warm darkness.
“一个迷人的代表——”他结结巴巴地说道，“——一家公司——给我带来一杯英国酒。”然后他安详地睡着了，时不时地打嗝，心满意足地进入柔软温暖的黑暗中。

VI

Next morning Dick came early into Nicole’s room. ‘I waited till I heard you up. Needless to say I feel badly about the evening—but how about no postmortems?’
第二天早上，迪克很早就来到了妮可的房​​间。 “我一直等到听到你的声音。不用说我对这个晚上感觉很糟糕——但是不进行尸检怎么样？

‘I’m agreed,’ she answered coolly, carrying her face to the mirror.
“我同意。”她把脸凑到镜子前，冷静地回答。

‘Tommy drove us home? Or did I dream it?’
“汤米开车送我们回家？还是我梦到的？

‘You know he did.’
“你知道他做到了。”

‘Seems probable,’ he admitted, ‘since I just heard him coughing. I think I’ll call on him.’
“看来有可能，”他承认，“因为我刚刚听到他咳嗽。我想我会去拜访他。

She was glad when he left her, for almost the first time in her life—his awful faculty of being right seemed to have deserted him at last.
当他离开她时，她很高兴，这几乎是她一生中的第一次——他那可怕的正确能力似乎终于抛弃了他。

Tommy was stirring in his bed, waking for café au lait.
汤米在床上翻来覆去，醒来要喝牛奶咖啡。

‘Feel all right?’ Dick asked.
“感觉还好吗？”迪克问道。

When Tommy complained of a sore throat he seized at a professional attitude.
当汤米抱怨喉咙痛时，他抓住了专业的态度。

‘Better have a gargle or something.’
“最好漱口什么的。”

‘You have one?’
'你有一个？'

‘Oddly enough I haven’t—probably Nicole has.’
“奇怪的是我没有——可能妮可有。”

‘Don’t disturb her.’
“别打扰她。”

‘She’s up.’
“她起来了。”

‘How is she?’
'她怎么样？'

Dick turned around slowly. ‘Did you expect her to be dead because I was tight?’ His tone was pleasant. ‘Nicole is now made of—of Georgia pine, which is the hardest wood known, except lignum vitæ from New Zealand—‘
迪克缓缓转过身。 “你就因为我太紧张就以为她会死吗？”他的语气很愉快。 “妮可现在由——乔治亚松制成，这是已知的最坚硬的木材，除了新西兰的木香——”

Nicole, going downstairs, heard the end of the conversation. She knew, as she had always known, that Tommy loved her; she knew he had come to dislike Dick, and that Dick had realized it before he did, and would react in some positive way to the man’s lonely passion. This thought was succeeded by a moment of sheerly feminine satisfaction. She leaned over her children’s breakfast table and told off instructions to the governess, while upstairs two men were concerned about her.
妮可下楼时听到了谈话的结束。她知道，正如她一直知道的那样，汤米爱她。她知道他开始不喜欢迪克，而迪克在他之前就意识到了这一点，并且会对这个男人孤独的激情做出积极的反应。这个念头随之而来的是一阵纯粹的女性满足感。她靠在孩子们的早餐桌上，向家庭女教师传达指示，而楼上的两个男人则关心着她。

Later in the garden she was happy; she did not want anything to happen, but only for the situation to remain in suspension as the two men tossed her from one mind to another; she had not existed for a long time, even as a ball.
后来在花园里她很高兴。她不想发生任何事情，但只希望当两个男人把她从一个想法抛到另一个想法时，局势继续悬而未决。她已经不存在很长时间了，甚至作为一个球也不存在了。

‘Nice, Rabbits, isn’t it—Or is it? Hey, Rabbit—hey you! Is it nice?—hey? Or does it sound very peculiar to you?’
‘很好，兔子，不是吗——或者是吗？嘿，兔子——嘿你！好看吗？——嘿？或者你觉得这听起来很奇怪吗？

The rabbit, after an experience of practically nothing else and cabbage leaves, agreed after a few tentative shiftings of the nose.
兔子在经历了几乎没有其他东西和卷心菜叶子的经历后，试探性地移动了几次鼻子，同意了。

Nicole went on through her garden routine. She left the flowers she cut in designated spots to be brought to the house later by the gardener. Reaching the sea wall she fell into a communicative mood and no one to communicate with; so she stopped and deliberated. She was somewhat shocked at the idea of being interested in another man—but other women have lovers—why not me? In the fine spring morning the inhibitions of the male world disappeared and she reasoned as gaily as a flower, while the wind blew her hair until her head moved with it. Other women have had lovers—the same forces that last night had made her yield to Dick up to the point of death, now kept her head nodding to the wind, content and happy with the logic of, Why shouldn’t I?
妮可继续她的花园日常工作。她把剪下来的花留在指定的地方，稍后由园丁带到家里。到了海堤，她陷入了一种交流的情绪，却没有人可以交流；于是她停下来思考。她对对另一个男人感兴趣的想法感到有些震惊——但其他女人都有情人——为什么我没有？春光明媚的早晨，男性世界的压抑消失殆尽，她像花儿一样快乐地思考，风吹动着她的头发，让她的头也随之移动。其他女人也有过情人——昨晚让她屈服于迪克直至死亡的同样的力量，现在却让她的头迎风点头，满足于这样的逻辑：我为什么不应该呢？

She sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the sea. But from another sea, the wide swell of fantasy, she had fished out something tangible to lay beside the rest of her loot. If she need not, in her spirit, be forever one with Dick as he had appeared last night, she must be something in addition, not just an image on his mind, condemned to endless parades around the circumference of a medal.
她坐在矮墙上，俯视着大海。但从另一个海洋，广阔的幻想中，她捞出了一些有形的东西，放在她其余的战利品旁边。如果她的精神不需要像迪克昨晚那样永远与迪克合而为一，那么她一定是另外的东西，而不仅仅是他心目中的一个形象，注定要绕着一枚奖章无休止地游行。

Nicole had chosen this part of the wall on which to sit, because the cliff shaded to a slanting meadow with a cultivated vegetable garden. Through a cluster of boughs she saw two men carrying rakes and spades and talking in a counterpoint of Niçoise and Provençal. Attracted by their words and gestures she caught the sense:
妮可选择坐在墙的这一部分上，因为悬崖遮蔽了一片倾斜的草地，草地上有一个开垦的菜园。透过一丛树枝，她看到两个男人拿着耙子和铁锹，用尼索瓦语和普罗旺斯语的对位说话。她被他们的话语和手势所吸引，意识到：

‘I laid her down here.’
“我把她放在这里。”

‘I took her behind the vines there.’
“我把她带到了那里的藤蔓后面。”

‘She doesn’t care—neither does he. It was that sacred dog. Well, I laid her down here—‘
“她不在乎——他也不在乎。”就是那只神圣的狗。好吧，我把她放在这里——”

‘You got the rake?’
“你有耙子吗？”

‘You got it yourself, you clown.’
“你自己得到的，你这个小丑。”

‘Well, I don’t care where you laid her down. Until that night I never even felt a woman’s breast against my chest since I married— twelve years ago. And now you tell me—‘
“好吧，我不在乎你把她放在哪里。自从我十二年前结婚以来，直到那天晚上，我什至从未感觉到过一个女人的乳房靠在我的胸前。现在你告诉我——”

‘But listen about the dog—‘
“但是听听那只狗的事——”

Nicole watched them through the boughs; it seemed all right what they were saying—one thing was good for one person, another for another. Yet it was a man’s world she had overheard; going back to the house she became doubtful again.
妮可透过树枝看着他们。他们说的似乎没什么问题——一件事对一个人有好处，另一件事对另一个人有好处。然而她无意中听到的却是一个男人的世界；回到家后，她又开始怀疑了。

Dick and Tommy were on the terrace. She walked through them and into the house, brought out a sketch pad and began a head of Tommy.
迪克和汤米在露台上。她穿过他们走进屋子，拿出一个素描本，开始画汤米的头像。

‘Hands never idle—distaff flying,’ Dick said lightly. How could he talk so trivially with the blood still drained down from his cheeks so that the auburn lather of beard showed red as his eyes? She turned to Tommy saying:
“我们的手一刻也不闲着——电线飞扬，”迪克轻声说道。他的脸颊上还流着血，胡须上的赤褐色泡沫和他的眼睛一样红，他怎么能说得这么琐碎呢？她转向汤米说：

‘I can always do something. I used to have a nice active little Polynesian ape and juggle him around for hours till people began to make the most dismal rough jokes—‘
‘我总能做点什么。我曾经养过一只活泼好动的波利尼西亚小猿，我会把他玩弄几个小时，直到人们开始开出最令人沮丧的粗俗笑话——”

She kept her eyes resolutely away from Dick. Presently he excused himself and went inside—she saw him pour himself two glasses of water, and she hardened further.
她坚决地将目光从迪克身上移开。过了一会儿，他告辞走了进去——她看见他给自己倒了两杯水，她的态度更加坚定了。

‘Nicole—‘ Tommy began but interrupted himself to clear the harshness from his throat.
“妮可——”汤米开口说道，但打断了自己，以清除喉咙里的刺耳声音。

‘I’m going to get you some special camphor rub,’ she suggested. ‘It’s American—Dick believes in it. I’ll be just a minute.’
“我去给你买一些特殊的樟脑膏，”她建议道。 “这是美国的——迪克相信它。我等一下。

‘I must go really.’
“我真的必须走了。”

Dick came out and sat down. ‘Believes in what?’ When she returned with the jar neither of the men had moved, though she gathered they had had some sort of excited conversation about nothing.
迪克出来坐下。 “相信什么？”当她带着罐子回来时，两个人都没有动，尽管她推测他们正在进行某种毫无意义的兴奋谈话。

The chauffeur was at the door, with a bag containing Tommy’s clothes of the night before. The sight of Tommy in clothes borrowed from Dick moved her sadly, falsely, as though Tommy were not able to afford such clothes.
司机站在门口，提着一个袋子，里面装着汤米前一天晚上的衣服。看到汤米穿着从迪克借来的衣服，她感到悲伤、虚假，仿佛汤米买不起这样的衣服。

‘When you get to the hotel rub this into your throat and chest and then inhale it,’ she said.
“当你到达酒店时，将其擦到喉咙和胸部，然后吸入，”她说。

‘Say, there,’ Dick murmured as Tommy went down the steps, ‘don’t give Tommy the whole jar—it has to be ordered from Paris—it’s out of stock down here.’
“喂，那里，”当汤米走下台阶时，迪克低声说道，“别把整个罐子给汤米——它必须从巴黎订购——这里缺货了。”

Tommy came back within hearing and the three of them stood in the sunshine, Tommy squarely before the car so that it seemed by leaning forward he would tip it upon his back.
汤米回来了，他们三人站在阳光下，汤米正好站在汽车前面，这样，只要向前倾身，他就会把汽车翻到背上。

Nicole stepped down to the path.
妮可走下小路。

‘Now catch it,’ she advised him. ‘It’s extremely rare.’
“现在抓住它，”她建议他。 “这是极其罕见的。”

She heard Dick grow silent at her side; she took a step off from him and waved as the car drove off with Tommy and the special camphor rub. Then she turned to take her own medicine.
她听到迪克在她身边沉默了。当汽车带着汤米和特制的樟脑膏开走时，她从他身边退了一步，向他挥手。然后她转身去吃自己的药。

‘There was no necessity for that gesture,’ Dick said. ‘There are four of us here—and for years whenever there’s a cough—‘
“没有必要做出这样的举动，”迪克说。 “我们这里有四个人——多年来只要有咳嗽——”

They looked at each other.
他们互相看着对方。

‘We can always get another jar—‘ then she lost her nerve and presently followed him upstairs where he lay down on his own bed and said nothing.
“我们总能再拿一个罐子——”然后她失去了勇气，跟着他上楼，他躺在自己的床上，什么也没说。

‘Do you want lunch to be brought up to you?’ she asked.
“你想把午餐送到你面前吗？”她问道。

He nodded and continued to lie quiescent, staring at the ceiling. Doubtfully she went to give the order. Upstairs again she looked into his room—the blue eyes, like searchlights, played on a dark sky. She stood a minute in the doorway, aware of the sin she had committed against him, half afraid to come in... . She put out her hand as if to rub his head, but he turned away like a suspicious animal. Nicole could stand the situation no longer; in a kitchen-maid’s panic she ran downstairs, afraid of what the stricken man above would feed on while she must still continue her dry suckling at his lean chest.
他点点头，继续安静地躺着，盯着天花板。她疑惑地去下达命令。她再次上楼看向他的房间——那双蓝色的眼睛，像探照灯一样，在黑暗的天空中嬉戏。她在门口站了一会儿，意识到自己对他犯下的罪孽，有点不敢进来……。她伸出手，似乎要揉揉他的头，但他却像一只可疑的动物一样转过身去。妮可再也无法忍受这种情况了。她像厨房女仆一样惊慌失措地跑下楼，担心楼上那个受伤的男人会吃什么，而她却必须继续在他瘦弱的胸前干奶。

In a week Nicole forgot her flash about Tommy—she had not much memory for people and forgot them easily. But in the first hot blast of June she heard he was in Nice. He wrote a little note to them both—and she opened it under the parasol, together with other mail they had brought from the house. After reading it she tossed it over to Dick, and in exchange he threw a telegram into the lap of her beach pajamas:
一周之内，妮可就忘记了关于汤米的一闪而过——她对人的记忆不多，很容易忘记他们。但在六月的第一场热风中，她听说他在尼斯。他给他们俩写了一张小纸条——她在阳伞下打开了它，还有他们从家里带来的其他邮件。读完后，她把它扔给迪克，作为交换，他把一封电报扔到她沙滩睡衣的腿上：

Dears will be at Gausses to-morrow unfortunately without mother am counting on seeing you.
不幸的是，亲爱的明天要去高斯，妈妈没有指望见到你。

‘I’ll be glad to see her,’ said Nicole, grimly.
“我会很高兴见到她，”妮可冷酷地说。

VII
七

But she went to the beach with Dick next morning with a renewal of her apprehension that Dick was contriving at some desperate solution. Since the evening on Golding’s yacht she had sensed what was going on. So delicately balanced was she between an old foothold that had always guaranteed her security, and the imminence of a leap from which she must alight changed in the very chemistry of blood and muscle, that she did not dare bring the matter into the true forefront of consciousness. The figures of Dick and herself, mutating, undefined, appeared as spooks caught up into a fantastic dance. For months every word had seemed to have an overtone of some other meaning, soon to be resolved under circumstances that Dick would determine. Though this state of mind was perhaps more hopeful,—the long years of sheer being had had an enlivening effect on the parts of her nature that early illness had killed, that Dick had not reached—through no fault of his but simply because no one nature can extend entirely inside another—it was still disquieting. The most unhappy aspect of their relations was Dick’s growing indifference, at present personified by too much drink; Nicole did not know whether she was to be crushed or spared— Dick’s voice, throbbing with insincerity, confused the issue; she couldn’t guess how he was going to behave next upon the tortuously slow unrolling of the carpet, nor what would happen at the end, at the moment of the leap.
但第二天早上，她和迪克一起去了海滩，她再次担心迪克正在想出一些绝望的解决方案。自从那天晚上在戈尔丁的游艇上以来，她就感觉到了正在发生的事情。她在一个始终保证她安全的旧立足点和迫在眉睫的飞跃之间保持着如此微妙的平衡，她必须从那里跳下来，血液和肌肉的化学成分发生了变化，她不敢把这件事带到真正的最前沿。意识。迪克和她自己的形象发生了变异，变得模糊不清，就像陷入了一场奇妙舞蹈的幽灵一样。几个月来，每个词似乎都隐含着某种其他含义，很快就会在迪克确定的情况下得到解决。虽然这种心态也许更有希望，——长年的纯粹存在对她天性中的部分产生了活跃的影响，这些部分被早年的疾病杀死了，而迪克还没有达到这一点——这不是他的错，而只是因为没有人自然可以完全延伸到另一个自然之中——这仍然令人不安。他们关系中最不愉快的方面是迪克日益冷漠，目前表现为酗酒。妮可不知道她是会被压垮还是幸免——迪克的声音因不真诚而颤抖，使问题变得混乱；她无法猜测当地毯缓慢地曲折地展开时他会如何表现，也无法猜测最后、在跳跃的那一刻会发生什么。

For what might occur thereafter she had no anxiety—she suspected that that would be the lifting of a burden, an unblinding of eyes. Nicole had been designed for change, for flight, with money as fins and wings. The new state of things would be no more than if a racing chassis, concealed for years under the body of a family limousine, should be stripped to its original self. Nicole could feel the fresh breeze already—the wrench it was she feared, and the dark manner of its coming.
对于此后可能发生的事情，她并不担心——她怀疑这将是一种负担的解除，一种睁开眼睛的感觉。妮可生来就是为了改变、为了飞翔，用金钱作为鳍和翅膀。新的情况只不过是隐藏在家庭豪华轿车车身下多年的赛车底盘被剥离到原来的样子。妮可已经能感觉到清新的微风了——她害怕那股扳手，以及它到来的黑暗方式。

The Divers went out on the beach with her white suit and his white trunks very white against the color of their bodies. Nicole saw Dick peer about for the children among the confused shapes and shadows of many umbrellas, and as his mind temporarily left her, ceasing to grip her, she looked at him with detachment, and decided that he was seeking his children, not protectively but for protection. Probably it was the beach he feared, like a deposed ruler secretly visiting an old court. She had come to hate his world with its delicate jokes and politenesses, forgetting that for many years it was the only world open to her. Let him look at it— his beach, perverted now to the tastes of the tasteless; he could search it for a day and find no stone of the Chinese Wall he had once erected around it, no footprint of an old friend.
潜水员夫妇穿着她的白色套装和他的白色泳裤来到海滩上，与他们的身体颜色形成鲜明对比。妮可看到迪克在许多雨伞的混乱形状和阴影中寻找孩子们，当他的思绪暂时离开她，不再抓住她时，她以超然的态度看着他，并确定他正在寻找他的孩子们，不是保护性的，而是为了保护。也许他害怕的是海滩，就像一个被废黜的统治者秘密拜访旧朝廷一样。她已经开始讨厌他的世界，因为他的世界充满了微妙的笑话和礼貌，忘记了多年来这是唯一向她开放的世界。让他看看吧——他的海滩，现在已经变质，迎合了无品位的人的口味；他可以搜索一天，也找不到他曾经在周围竖起的中国长城的石头，也找不到老朋友的足迹。

For a moment Nicole was sorry it was so; remembering the glass he had raked out of the old trash heap, remembering the sailor trunks and sweaters they had bought in a Nice back street—garments that afterward ran through a vogue in silk among the Paris couturiers, remembering the simple little French girls climbing on the breakwaters crying ‘Dites donc! Dites donc!’ like birds, and the ritual of the morning time, the quiet restful extraversion toward sea and sun—many inventions of his, buried deeper than the sand under the span of so few years... .
有一瞬间，妮可为这样的事情感到遗憾。记得他从旧垃圾堆里翻出来的玻璃杯，记得他们在尼斯后街买的水手裤和毛衣——这些衣服后来在巴黎女装设计师中风靡丝绸时装，记得那些单纯的法国小女孩爬上来。防波堤高喊着“Dites donc！” “Dites donc！”像鸟儿一样，还有早晨的仪式，对大海和阳光的安静、宁静的外向——他的许多发明，在短短几年的时间里，埋得比沙子还深……。

Now the swimming place was a ‘club,’ though, like the international society it represented, it would be hard to say who was not admitted.
现在，游泳场所是一个“俱乐部”，不过，就像它所代表的国际社会一样，很难说谁不被接纳。

Nicole hardened again as Dick knelt on the straw mat and looked about for Rosemary. Her eyes followed his, searching among the new paraphernalia, the trapezes over the water, the swinging rings, the portable bathhouses, the floating towers, the searchlights from last night’s fêtes, the modernistic buffet, white with a hackneyed motif of endless handlebars.
当迪克跪在草席上四处寻找罗斯玛丽时，妮可再次变得坚强。她的目光追随他的脚步，在新的用具中搜寻：水上的秋千、秋千、便携式浴室、漂浮的塔、昨晚节日的探照灯、现代主义的自助餐，白色的自助餐上有无数把手的老套图案。

The water was almost the last place he looked for Rosemary, because few people swam any more in that blue paradise, children and one exhibitionistic valet who punctuated the morning with spectacular dives from a fifty-foot rock—most of Gausse’s guests stripped the concealing pajamas from their flabbiness only for a short hangover dip at one o’clock.
水里几乎是他寻找迷迭香的最后一个地方，因为在那个蓝色天堂里已经很少有人游泳了，孩子们和一名暴露狂的男仆在早上从五十英尺高的岩石上进行了壮观的潜水——大多数高斯的客人都脱掉了隐藏的睡衣他们的松弛只是在一点钟的时候短暂的宿醉。

‘There she is,’ Nicole remarked.
“她在那儿，”妮可说。

She watched Dick’s eyes following Rosemary’s track from raft to raft; but the sigh that rocked out of her bosom was something left over from five years ago.
她看着迪克的目光追随着罗斯玛丽的足迹，从一个木筏走到另一个木筏。但从她怀里发出的叹息却是五年前遗留下来的。

‘Let’s swim out and speak to Rosemary,’ he suggested.
“我们游出去和罗斯玛丽谈谈吧，”他建议道。

‘You go.’
'你去。'

‘We’ll both go.’ She struggled a moment against his pronouncement, but eventually they swam out together, tracing Rosemary by the school of little fish who followed her, taking their dazzle from her, the shining spoon of a trout hook.
“我们俩都去吧。”她挣扎了一会儿，不同意他的说法，但最终他们一起游了出去，跟着跟随她的小鱼群追踪迷迭香，夺走了她眼花缭乱的鳟鱼钩的勺子。

Nicole stayed in the water while Dick hoisted himself up beside Rosemary, and the two sat dripping and talking, exactly as if they had never loved or touched each other. Rosemary was beautiful—her youth was a shock to Nicole, who rejoiced, however, that the young girl was less slender by a hairline than herself. Nicole swam around in little rings, listening to Rosemary who was acting amusement, joy, and expectation—more confident than she had been five years ago.
妮可留在水里，迪克则在罗斯玛丽身边站起身来，两人浑身湿淋淋地坐着说话，就好像他们从未爱过或触摸过对方一样。迷迭香很漂亮——她的年轻让妮可感到震惊，但她很高兴这个年轻女孩比她自己苗条一点。妮可在小圈里游来游去，听着罗斯玛丽说话，她表现出有趣、喜悦和期待——比五年前更加自信。

‘I miss Mother so, but she’s meeting me in Paris, Monday.’
“我非常想念母亲，但她周一要在巴黎见我。”

‘Five years ago you came here,’ said Dick. ‘And what a funny little thing you were, in one of those hotel peignoirs!’
“五年前你来到这里，”迪克说。 “你是一个多么有趣的小东西，在那些旅馆里！”

‘How you remember things! You always did—and always the nice things.’
‘你的记忆力多么好啊！你总是这么做——而且总是好事。”

Nicole saw the old game of flattery beginning again and she dove under water, coming up again to hear:
妮可看到老套的奉承游戏又开始了，她潜入水下，再次浮上来听到：

‘I’m going to pretend it’s five years ago and I’m a girl of eighteen again. You could always make me feel some you know, kind of, you know, kind of happy way—you and Nicole. I feel as if you’re still on the beach there, under one of those umbrellas—the nicest people I’d ever known, maybe ever will.’
“我要假装这是五年前，我又变成了一个十八岁的女孩。你总能让我感受到一些你知道的、你知道的、一种快乐的方式——你和妮可。我感觉你好像还在海滩上，在一把遮阳伞下——他们是我所认识的最好的人，也许永远都会。

Swimming away, Nicole saw that the cloud of Dick’s heart-sickness had lifted a little as he began to play with Rosemary, bringing out his old expertness with people, a tarnished object of art; she guessed that with a drink or so he would have done his stunts on the swinging rings for her, fumbling through stunts he had once done with ease. She noticed that this summer, for the first time, he avoided high diving.
游走后，妮可看到迪克的心脏病的阴云已经稍稍散去，他开始和罗斯玛丽玩耍，展现出他过去与人打交道的技巧，就像一件失去光泽的艺术品；她猜想，喝了一杯左右，他就会为她完成吊环上的特技，摸索着他曾经轻松完成的特技。她注意到，今年夏天，他第一次避免了高空跳水。

Later, as she dodged her way from raft to raft, Dick overtook her.
后来，当她从一个木筏躲到另一个木筏时，迪克追上了她。

‘Some of Rosemary’s friends have a speed boat, the one out there. Do you want to aquaplane? I think it would be amusing.’
“罗斯玛丽的一些朋友有一艘快艇，就是外面的那艘。你想玩水上飞机吗？我认为这会很有趣。

Remembering that once he could stand on his hands on a chair at the end of a board, she indulged him as she might have indulged Lanier. Last summer on the Zugersee they had played at that pleasant water game, and Dick had lifted a two-hundred-pound man from the board onto his shoulders and stood up. But women marry all their husbands’ talents and naturally, afterwards, are not so impressed with them as they may keep up the pretense of being. Nicole had not even pretended to be impressed, though she had said ‘Yes’ to him, and ‘Yes, I thought so too.’
记得有一次他可以用手站在木板末端的椅子上，她纵容了他，就像纵容拉尼尔一样。去年夏天，他们在祖格湖上玩了一场愉快的水上游戏，迪克把一个两百磅重的人从棋盘上扛到肩上，站了起来。但女人嫁给了她们丈夫所有的才华，自然而然地，她们对他们的印象就不那么深刻了，因为她们可能会继续假装存在。妮可甚至没有假装印象深刻，尽管她对他说“是”，并且“是的，我也是这么想的。”

She knew, though, that he was somewhat tired, that it was only the closeness of Rosemary’s exciting youth that prompted the impending effort—she had seen him draw the same inspiration from the new bodies of her children and she wondered coldly if he would make a spectacle of himself. The Divers were older than the others in the boat—the young people were polite, deferential, but Nicole felt an undercurrent of ‘Who are these Numbers anyhow?’ and she missed Dick’s easy talent of taking control of situations and making them all right—he had concentrated on what he was going to try to do.
不过，她知道他有点累了，只是罗斯玛丽令人兴奋的青春的亲密感促使了即将到来的努力——她看到他从她孩子们的新身体中汲取了同样的灵感，她冷冷地想知道他是否会做出这样的努力。他自己的奇观。潜水员们比船上的其他人年长——年轻人都很有礼貌、恭敬，但妮可心里暗涌着一股“这些数字到底是谁？”的念头，她怀念迪克轻松掌控局势并使一切顺利的天赋——他全神贯注于他将要尝试做的事情。

The motor throttled down two hundred yards from shore and one of the young men dove flat over the edge. He swam at the aimless twisting board, steadied it, climbed slowly to his knees on it— then got on his feet as the boat accelerated. Leaning back he swung his light vehicle ponderously from side to side in slow, breathless arcs that rode the trailing side-swell at the end of each swing. In the direct wake of the boat he let go his rope, balanced for a moment, then back-flipped into the water, disappearing like a statue of glory, and reappearing as an insignificant head while the boat made the circle back to him.
距离海岸两百码处，发动机逐渐减速，其中一名年轻人一头扎进了边缘。他游向漫无目的的扭转板，稳住它，慢慢地跪在上面——然后在船加速时站起来。他向后靠去，缓慢地从一侧摇到另一侧，缓慢地、气喘吁吁地划出弧线，在每次摆动结束时，伴随着尾随的侧浪。紧接着船的尾流，他松开了绳子，平衡了一会儿，然后后空翻入水，像一尊荣耀的雕像一样消失了，当船绕着圈回到他身边时，他又以一个微不足道的头颅重新出现。

Nicole refused her turn; then Rosemary rode the board neatly and conservatively, with facetious cheers from her admirers. Three of them scrambled egotistically for the honor of pulling her into the boat, managing, among them, to bruise her knee and hip against the side.
妮可拒绝轮到她。然后，罗斯玛丽干净利落、保守地登上了董事会，她的崇拜者们发出了滑稽的欢呼。其中三个人自负地争先恐后地争夺将她拉上船的荣誉，其中包括在船舷上擦伤了她的膝盖和臀部。

‘Now you. Doctor,’ said the Mexican at the wheel.
'现在轮到你。医生，”开车的墨西哥人说道。

Dick and the last young man dove over the side and swam to the board. Dick was going to try his lifting trick and Nicole began to watch with smiling scorn. This physical showing-off for Rosemary irritated her most of all.
迪克和最后一个年轻人从船边跳了下去，游到了冲浪板上。迪克正要尝试他的举重技巧，妮可开始带着轻蔑的微笑看着。这种对罗斯玛丽的身体炫耀最让她恼火。

When the men had ridden long enough to find their balance, Dick knelt, and putting the back of his neck in the other man’s crotch, found the rope through his legs, and slowly began to rise.
当两个人骑了足够长的距离找到平衡后，迪克跪下，将脖子后面放在另一个人的胯部，找到绳子穿过他的腿，然后慢慢开始上升。

The people in the boat, watching closely, saw that he was having difficulties. He was on one knee; the trick was to straighten all the way up in the same motion with which he left his kneeling position. He rested for a moment, then his face contracted as he put his heart into the strain, and lifted.
船上的人注视着他，看出他遇到了困难。他单膝跪地。诀窍就是以与离开跪姿时相同的动作完全挺直。他休息了一会儿，然后他的脸因紧张而收缩，然后抬起来。

The board was narrow, the man, though weighing less than a hundred and fifty, was awkward with his weight and grabbed clumsily at Dick’s head. When, with a last wrenching effort of his back, Dick stood upright, the board slid sidewise and the pair toppled into the sea.
木板很窄，这个人虽然体重还不到一百五十，但他的体重却很笨拙，笨拙地抓住了迪克的头。当迪克最后使出背部的力气站直时，木板向侧面滑动，两人跌入海中。

In the boat Rosemary exclaimed: ‘Wonderful! They almost had it.’
罗斯玛丽在船上惊叹道：“太棒了！他们差一点就成功了。

But as they came back to the swimmers Nicole watched for a sight of Dick’s face. It was full of annoyance as she expected, because he had done the thing with ease only two years ago.
但当他们回到游泳者身边时，妮可看到了迪克的脸。正如她预料的那样，充满了烦恼，因为两年前他还轻而易举地做到了这一点。

The second time he was more careful. He rose a little testing the balance of his burden, settled down again on his knee; then, grunting ‘Alley oop!’ began to rise—but before he could really straighten out, his legs suddenly buckled and he shoved the board away with his feet to avoid being struck as they fell off.
第二次他更加小心了。他站起身来测试一下自己的负担是否平衡，然后又在膝盖上坐下来。然后，他开始发出“哎哟！”的咕噜声，但还没等他真正站直，双腿突然一软，他用脚把木板推开，以免摔倒时被撞到。

This time when the Baby Gar came back it was apparent to all the passengers that he was angry.
这一次，当宝贝加尔回来时，所有乘客都明显看出他很生气。

‘Do you mind if I try that once more?’ he called, treading water. ‘We almost had it then.’
“你介意我再试一次吗？”他踩着水喊道。 “那时我们几乎就拥有了它。”

‘Sure. Go ahead.’
'当然。前进。'

To Nicole he looked white-around-the-gills, and she cautioned him:
在妮可看来，他脸色惨白，她警告他：

‘Don’t you think that’s enough for now?’
“你觉得现在还不够吗？”

He didn’t answer. The first partner had had plenty and was hauled over the side, the Mexican driving the motor boat obligingly took his place.
他没有回答。第一个伙伴已经吃够了，被拖到一边，驾驶摩托艇的墨西哥人殷勤地取代了他的位置。

He was heavier than the first man. As the boat gathered motion, Dick rested for a moment, belly-down on the board. Then he got beneath the man and took the rope, and his muscles flexed as he tried to rise.
他比第一个人重。当船开始移动时，迪克在船上休息了一会儿，腹部朝下。然后他走到那人身下，抓住绳子，试图站起来时，他的肌肉绷紧了。

He could not rise. Nicole saw him shift his position and strain upward again but at the instant when the weight of his partner was full upon his shoulders he became immovable. He tried again— lifting an inch, two inches—Nicole felt the sweat glands of her forehead open as she strained with him—then he was simply holding his ground, then he collapsed back down on his knees with a smack, and they went over, Dick’s head barely missing a kick of the board.
他无法站起来。妮可看到他改变了姿势，再次向上用力，但就在他搭档的重量压在他肩上的那一刻，他变得一动不动。他又试了一次——举起一英寸，两英寸——妮可感觉到她前额的汗腺张开了，因为她用力拉着他——然后他只是坚守阵地，然后他一巴掌倒在膝盖上，他们就倒下了。 ，迪克的头差一点就踢到了木板。

‘Hurry back!’ Nicole called to the driver; even as she spoke she saw him slide under water and she gave a little cry; but he came up again and turned on his back, and ‘Château’ swam near to help. It seemed forever till the boat reached them but when they came alongside at last and Nicole saw Dick floating exhausted and expressionless, alone with the water and the sky, her panic changed suddenly to contempt.
“快点回来！”妮可对司机喊道。就在她说话的时候，她看到他滑入水下，她轻轻地叫了一声。但他又浮上来，翻身仰面，“城堡”游到附近帮忙。似乎过了很久，船才到达他们身边，但当他们终于靠岸时，妮可看到迪克精疲力尽、面无表情地漂浮在水面和天空中，她的惊慌突然变成了轻蔑。

‘We’ll help you up, Doctor... . Get his foot ... all right ... now altogether... .’
“我们会帮助你的，医生……”站起来……好吧……现在完全……”

Dick sat panting and looking at nothing.
迪克气喘吁吁地坐着，什么也没看着。

‘I knew you shouldn’t have tried it,’ Nicole could not help saying.
“我就知道你不应该尝试。”妮可忍不住说道。

‘He’d tired himself the first two times,’ said the Mexican.
“前两次他都累坏了，”墨西哥人说。

‘It was a foolish thing,’ Nicole insisted. Rosemary tactfully said nothing.
“这是一件愚蠢的事情，”妮可坚持说。罗斯玛丽机智地什么也没说。

After a minute Dick got his breath, panting, ‘I couldn’t have lifted a paper doll that time.’
过了一会儿，迪克喘了口气，气喘吁吁地说：“那次我连纸娃娃都举不起来了。”

An explosive little laugh relieved the tension caused by his failure. They were all attentive to Dick as he disembarked at the dock. But Nicole was annoyed—everything he did annoyed her now.
爆发性的小笑缓解了他因失败而产生的紧张感。当迪克在码头下船时，他们都在关注他。但妮可很恼火——他现在所做的一切都让她恼火。

She sat with Rosemary under an umbrella while Dick went to the buffet for a drink—he returned presently with some sherry for them.
她和罗斯玛丽坐在雨伞下，而迪克去自助餐厅喝了一杯——他很快就回来了，给他们带来了一些雪利酒。

‘The first drink I ever had was with you,’ Rosemary said, and with a spurt of enthusiasm she added, ‘Oh, I’m so glad to see you and KNOW you’re all right. I was worried—‘ Her sentence broke as she changed direction ‘that maybe you wouldn’t be.’
“我喝的第一杯酒是和你一起喝的，”罗斯玛丽说，她热情地补充道，“哦，我很高兴见到你，知道你一切都好。”我很担心——”当她改变方向时，她的句子中断了，“也许你不会。”

‘Did you hear I’d gone into a process of deterioration?’
“你听说我的病情正在恶化吗？”

‘Oh, no. I simply—just heard you’d changed. And I’m glad to see with my own eyes it isn’t true.’
'不好了。我只是——刚刚听说你变了。我很高兴亲眼看到这不是真的。”

‘It is true,’ Dick answered, sitting down with them. ‘The change came a long way back—but at first it didn’t show. The manner remains intact for some time after the morale cracks.’
“确实如此，”迪克一边回答，一边和他们一起坐下。 “这种变化很久以前就发生了——但一开始并没有表现出来。在士气崩溃后的一段时间内，这种态度仍然保持不变。

‘Do you practise on the Riviera?’ Rosemary demanded hastily.
“你在里维埃拉练习吗？”罗斯玛丽急忙问道。

‘It’d be a good ground to find likely specimens.’ He nodded here and there at the people milling about in the golden sand. ‘Great candidates. Notice our old friend, Mrs. Abrams, playing duchess to Mary North’s queen? Don’t get jealous about it—think of Mrs. Abram’s long climb up the back stairs of the Ritz on her hands and knees and all the carpet dust she had to inhale.’
“这将是寻找可能标本的好地方。”他向在金色沙滩上转来转去的人们点点头。 “伟大的候选人。注意到我们的老朋友艾布拉姆斯夫人扮演玛丽·诺斯女王的公爵夫人了吗？不要为此嫉妒——想想艾布拉姆夫人用手和膝盖爬上丽兹酒店后楼梯的漫长过程，以及她不得不吸入的所有地毯灰尘。

Rosemary interrupted him. ‘But is that really Mary North?’ She was regarding a woman sauntering in their direction followed by a small group who behaved as if they were accustomed to being looked at. When they were ten feet away, Mary’s glance flickered fractionally over the Divers, one of those unfortunate glances that indicate to the glanced-upon that they have been observed but are to be overlooked, the sort of glance that neither the Divers nor Rosemary Hoyt had ever permitted themselves to throw at any one in their lives. Dick was amused when Mary perceived Rosemary, changed her plans and came over. She spoke to Nicole with pleasant heartiness, nodded unsmilingly to Dick as if he were somewhat contagious—whereupon he bowed in ironic respect—as she greeted Rosemary.
罗斯玛丽打断了他的话。 “但这真的是玛丽·诺斯吗？”她看着一个女人朝他们的方向走来，后面跟着一小群人，他们的举止似乎习惯了被人注视。当他们距离十英尺远时，玛丽的目光在潜水员身上闪烁了一下，这是一种不幸的目光，向被瞥见的人表明他们已经被观察到，但应该被忽视，这种眼神是潜水员和罗斯玛丽·霍伊特都没有见过的。曾经允许自己向生命中的任何人扔东西。当玛丽看到罗斯玛丽并改变计划并过来时，迪克感到好笑。她以令人愉快的热忱与妮可说话，面无笑容地向迪克点点头，就好像他有感染力一样——于是他以讽刺的方式鞠了一躬——当她向罗斯玛丽打招呼时。

‘I heard you were here. For how long?’
‘我听说你在这里。多长时间？'

‘Until to-morrow,’ Rosemary answered.
“明天见。”罗斯玛丽回答道。

She, too, saw how Mary had walked through the Divers to talk to her, and a sense of obligation kept her unenthusiastic. No, she could not dine to-night.
她也看到玛丽是如何穿过戴弗家来和她说话的，一种义务感让她不那么热情。不，她今晚不能吃饭。

Mary turned to Nicole, her manner indicating affection blended with pity.
玛丽转向妮可，她的举止流露出爱意与怜悯。

‘How are the children?’ she asked.
“孩子们怎么样？”她问道。

They came up at the moment, and Nicole gave ear to a request that she overrule the governess on a swimming point.
他们此时出现了，妮可听从了她在游泳点上否决家庭女教师的请求。

‘No,’ Dick answered for her. ‘What Mademoiselle says must go.’
“不，”迪克替她回答。 “小姐说的必须去。”

Agreeing that one must support delegated authority, Nicole refused their request, whereupon Mary—who in the manner of an Anita Loos’ heroine had dealings only with Faits Accomplis, who indeed could not have house-broken a French poodle puppy—regarded Dick as though he were guilty of a most flagrant bullying. Dick, chafed by the tiresome performance, inquired with mock solicitude:
妮可同意人们必须支持下放的权力，但拒绝了他们的要求，于是玛丽——她以安妮塔·路斯笔下的女主角的方式只与既成事实打交道，她确实不可能拆散一只法国贵宾犬小狗——把迪克视为好像他犯下了最公然的欺凌行为。迪克对这种令人厌烦的表现感到恼火，假装关心地问道：

‘How are your children—and their aunts?’
“你的孩子们——还有他们的阿姨怎么样？”

Mary did not answer; she left them, first draping a sympathetic hand over Lanier’s reluctant head. After she had gone Dick said: ‘When I think of the time I spent working over her.’
玛丽没有回答。她离开了他们，首先同情地把手放在了拉尼尔不情愿的头上。她走后，迪克说：“当我想起我花在她身上的时间时。”

‘I like her,’ said Nicole.
“我喜欢她，”妮可说。

Dick’s bitterness had surprised Rosemary, who had thought of him as all-forgiving, all-comprehending. Suddenly she recalled what it was she had heard about him. In conversation with some State Department people on the boat,—Europeanized Americans who had reached a position where they could scarcely have been said to belong to any nation at all, at least not to any great power though perhaps to a Balkan-like state composed of similar citizens—the name of the ubiquitously renowned Baby Warren had occurred and it was remarked that Baby’s younger sister had thrown herself away on a dissipated doctor. ‘He’s not received anywhere any more,’ the woman said.
迪克的痛苦让罗斯玛丽感到惊讶，她认为他是一个宽容、包容的人。突然，她想起了她听说过的有关他的事情。在与船上的一些国务院人员交谈时，欧洲化的美国人已经达到了这样一种境地：他们几乎不能说属于任何国家，至少不属于任何大国，尽管也许属于一个类似巴尔干的国家。类似的公民——众所周知的巴比·沃伦的名字出现了，据说巴比的妹妹爱上了一个放荡的医生。 “他再也没有被接待过，”女人说。

The phrase disturbed Rosemary, though she could not place the Divers as living in any relation to society where such a fact, if fact it was, could have any meaning, yet the hint of a hostile and organized public opinion rang in her ears. ‘He’s not received anywhere any more.’ She pictured Dick climbing the steps of a mansion, presenting cards and being told by a butler: ‘We’re not receiving you any more”; then proceeding down an avenue only to be told the same thing by the countless other butlers of countless Ambassadors, Ministers, Chargés d’Affaires... .
这句话让罗斯玛丽感到不安，尽管她无法将戴弗夫妇生活在社会中，这样的事实（如果是事实的话）可能具有任何意义，但她的耳边却响起了敌意和有组织的公众舆论的暗示。 “他不再被任何地方接待了。”她想象迪克爬上一座豪宅的台阶，递上卡片，管家告诉他：“我们不再接待你了”；然后沿着一条大街走下去，却被无数大使、部长、临时代办的无数其他管家告诉了同样的事情……

Nicole wondered how she could get away. She guessed that Dick, stung into alertness, would grow charming and would make Rosemary respond to him. Sure enough, in a moment his voice managed to qualify everything unpleasant he had said:
妮可想知道她怎样才能逃脱。她猜想，被刺痛后变得警觉的迪克会变得迷人，会让罗斯玛丽对他做出反应。果然，他的声音立刻就将他所说的所有不愉快的话都化解了：

‘Mary’s all right—she’s done very well. But it’s hard to go on liking people who don’t like you.’
“玛丽很好——她做得很好。但继续喜欢不喜欢你的人是很困难的。”

Rosemary, falling into line, swayed toward Dick and crooned:
迷迭香列队，摇晃着走向迪克，低吟道：

‘Oh, you’re so nice. I can’t imagine anybody not forgiving you anything, no matter what you did to them.’ Then feeling that her exuberance had transgressed on Nicole’s rights, she looked at the sand exactly between them: ‘I wanted to ask you both what you thought of my latest pictures—if you saw them.’
‘哦，你真是太好了。我无法想象有人不会原谅你任何事情，无论你对他们做了什么。”然后，她觉得自己的热情侵犯了妮可的权利，她看着他们之间的沙子：“我想问你们俩的想法我最新的照片——如果你看过的话。”

Nicole said nothing, having seen one of them and thought little about it.
妮可一言不发，因为她看到了其中一个，也没有多想。

‘It’ll take a few minutes to tell you,’ Dick said. ‘Let’s suppose that Nicole says to you that Lanier is ill. What do you do in life? What does anyone do? They ACT—face, voice, words—the face shows sorrow, the voice shows shock, the words show sympathy.’
“需要几分钟才能告诉你，”迪克说。 “假设妮可对你说拉尼尔病了。你在生活中做什么？有人做什么？他们的行动——面部表情、声音、言语——面部表现出悲伤，声音表现出震惊，言语表现出同情。

‘Yes—I understand.’
'是的我明白。'

‘But in the theatre, No. In the theatre all the best comediennes have built up their reputations by burlesquing the correct emotional responses—fear and love and sympathy.’
“但在剧院里，不。在剧院里，所有最好的喜剧演员都是通过表演正确的情感反应——恐惧、爱和同情——来建立自己的声誉。”

‘I see.’ Yet she did not quite see.
“我明白了。”但她还没有完全明白。

Losing the thread of it, Nicole’s impatience increased as Dick continued:
当迪克继续说道时，妮可失去了线索，变得更加不耐烦：

‘The danger to an actress is in responding. Again, let’s suppose that somebody told you, ‘Your lover is dead.’ In life you’d probably go to pieces. But on the stage you’re trying to entertain—the audience can do the ‘responding’ for themselves. First the actress has lines to follow, then she has to get the audience’s attention back on herself, away from the murdered Chinese or whatever the thing is. So she must do something unexpected. If the audience thinks the character is hard she goes soft on them—if they think she’s soft she goes hard. You go all OUT of character—you understand?’
“女演员的危险在于做出反应。再一次，假设有人告诉你，“你的爱人死了。”在生活中你可能会崩溃。但在舞台上你试图娱乐——观众可以自己“回应”。首先，女演员要遵循台词，然后她必须让观众的注意力回到自己身上，远离被谋杀的中国人或其他什么东西。所以她必须做出一些意想不到的事情。如果观众认为这个角色很严厉，那么她就会对他们温柔一些；如果他们认为她很温柔，那么她就会变得严厉。你完全不符合性格——明白吗？

‘I don’t quite,’ admitted Rosemary. ‘How do you mean out of character?’
“我不太明白，”罗斯玛丽承认。 “不合性格是什么意思？”

‘You do the unexpected thing until you’ve manoeuvred the audience back from the objective fact to yourself. THEN you slide into character again.’
“你会做出意想不到的事情，直到你把观众从客观事实中拉回到你自己身上。然后你又进入角色了。

Nicole could stand no more. She stood up sharply, making no attempt to conceal her impatience. Rosemary, who had been for a few minutes half-conscious of this, turned in a conciliatory way to Topsy.
妮可再也无法忍受了。她猛地站了起来，丝毫没有掩饰自己的不耐烦。罗斯玛丽在几分钟内半意识地意识到了这一点，她以一种和解的方式转向托普西。

‘Would you like to be an actress when you grow up? I think you’d make a fine actress.’
‘你长大后想当演员吗？我认为你会成为一名优秀的女演员。

Nicole stared at her deliberately and in her grandfather’s voice said, slow and distinct:
妮可故意盯着她，用祖父的声音缓慢而清晰地说道：

‘It’s absolutely OUT to put such ideas in the heads of other people’s children. Remember, we may have quite different plans for them.’ She turned sharply to Dick. ‘I’m going to take the car home. I’ll send Michelle for you and the children.’
“把这样的想法灌输给别人的孩子是绝对不行的。”请记住，我们可能对他们有完全不同的计划。”她猛地转向迪克。 ‘我要把车开回家。我会派米歇尔去接你和孩子们。

‘You haven’t driven for months,’ he protested.
“你已经几个月没开车了，”他抗议道。

‘I haven’t forgotten how.’
“我还没忘记怎么做。”

Without a glance at Rosemary whose face was ‘responding’ violently, Nicole left the umbrella.
妮可没有看一脸剧烈“反应”的罗斯玛丽，就离开了伞。

In the bathhouse, she changed to pajamas, her expression still hard as a plaque. But as she turned into the road of arched pines and the atmosphere changed,—with a squirrel’s flight on a branch, a wind nudging at the leaves, a cock splitting distant air, with a creep of sunlight transpiring through the immobility, then the voices of the beach receded—Nicole relaxed and felt new and happy; her thoughts were clear as good bells—she had a sense of being cured and in a new way. Her ego began blooming like a great rich rose as she scrambled back along the labyrinths in which she had wandered for years. She hated the beach, resented the places where she had played planet to Dick’s sun.
到了澡堂，她换上了睡衣，表情依然坚如牌匾。但当她拐入拱形松树路时，气氛发生了变化——一只松鼠在树枝上飞翔，一阵风轻拂着树叶，一只公鸡劈开远处的空气，一缕阳光透过一动不动的地方透进来，然后是声音海滩的气息退去——妮可放松下来，感到新鲜而快乐；她的思绪清晰如好钟声——她有一种被治愈的感觉，而且是以一种新的方式。当她沿着她徘徊多年的迷宫爬回来时，她的自我开始像一朵伟大而浓郁的玫瑰一样绽放。她讨厌海滩，怨恨她在迪克的阳光下玩耍的地方。

‘Why, I’m almost complete,’ she thought. ‘I’m practically standing alone, without him.’ And like a happy child, wanting the completion as soon as possible, and knowing vaguely that Dick had planned for her to have it, she lay on her bed as soon as she got home and wrote Tommy Barban in Nice a short provocative letter.
“哎呀，我快完成了，”她想。 “没有他，我几乎是一个人站着。”就像一个快乐的孩子，想要尽快完成，并且隐约知道迪克已经计划让她拥有它，她一回到家就躺在床上并给尼斯的汤米·巴尔班写了一封简短的挑衅性信。

But that was for the daytime—toward evening with the inevitable diminution of nervous energy, her spirits flagged, and the arrows flew a little in the twilight. She was afraid of what was in Dick’s mind; again she felt that a plan underlay his current actions and she was afraid of his plans—they worked well and they had an all-inclusive logic about them which Nicole was not able to command. She had somehow given over the thinking to him, and in his absences her every action seemed automatically governed by what he would like, so that now she felt inadequate to match her intentions against his. Yet think she must; she knew at last the number on the dreadful door of fantasy, the threshold to the escape that was no escape; she knew that for her the greatest sin now and in the future was to delude herself. It had been a long lesson but she had learned it. Either you think—or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.
但那是白天的事——到了晚上，神经能量不可避免地减弱，她的精神萎靡不振，箭在暮色中飞了一点。她害怕迪克的想法；她害怕迪克的想法。她再次感到他目前的行动背后有一个计划，她害怕他的计划——它们运作良好，而且有一种包罗万象的逻辑，这是妮可无法指挥的。不知怎么的，她已经把自己的想法交给了他，在他不在的时候，她的每一个行动似乎都自动地受他的意愿支配，所以现在她觉得自己不足以让自己的意图与他的意图相一致。但她认为她必须这么做；她终于知道了那扇可怕的幻想之门的数字，那是通往逃亡的门槛，但那是无法逃脱的。她知道，对她现在和将来来说，最大的罪孽就是欺骗自己。这是一个漫长的教训，但她已经学会了。要么你思考，要么其他人必须为你思考，从你手中夺走权力，扭曲和规矩你的自然品味，教化你并消灭你。

They had a tranquil supper with Dick drinking much beer and being cheerful with the children in the dusky room. Afterward he played some Schubert songs and some new jazz from America that Nicole hummed in her harsh, sweet contralto over his shoulder.
他们安静地吃了一顿晚餐，迪克喝了很多啤酒，在昏暗的房间里和孩子们一起愉快地玩耍。随后，他演奏了一些舒伯特的歌曲和一些来自美国的新爵士乐，妮可在他肩上用她刺耳而甜美的女低音哼唱着。

“Thank y’ father-r
“谢谢你的父亲-r

Thank y’ mother-r
谢谢你妈妈-r

Thanks for meetingup with one another—‘
感谢你们的相遇——‘

‘I don’t like that one,’ Dick said, starting to turn the page.
“我不喜欢那个，”迪克说，开始翻页。

‘Oh, play it!’ she exclaimed. ‘Am I going through the rest of life flinching at the word ‘father’?’
“哦，玩吧！”她喊道。 “我是否会在余生中因‘父亲’这个词而畏缩？”

’—Thank the horse that pulled the buggy that night!
’——感谢那天晚上拉马车的那匹马！

Thank you both for being justabit tight—‘
谢谢你们俩的紧张——”

Later they sat with the children on the Moorish roof and watched the fireworks of two casinos, far apart, far down on the shore. It was lonely and sad to be so empty-hearted toward each other.
后来，他们和孩子们坐在摩尔人的屋顶上，观看了距离海岸很远的两个赌场的烟火表演。彼此之间如此空虚，真是孤独又悲伤。

Next morning, back from shopping in Cannes, Nicole found a note saying that Dick had taken the small car and gone up into Provence for a few days by himself. Even as she read it the phone rang—it was Tommy Barban from Monte Carlo, saying that he had received her letter and was driving over. She felt her lips’ warmth in the receiver as she welcomed his coming.
第二天早上，从戛纳购物回来，妮可发现一张纸条，上面写着迪克已经开着那辆小车独自去普罗旺斯待了几天。她刚读到这封信，电话就响了——是来自蒙特卡洛的汤米·巴尔班，说他收到了她的信，正开车过来。当她欢迎他的到来时，她感受到了听筒里嘴唇的温暖。

VIII
八

She bathed and anointed herself and covered her body with a layer of powder, while her toes crunched another pile on a bath towel. She looked microscopically at the lines of her flanks, wondering how soon the fine, slim edifice would begin to sink squat and earthward. In about six years, but now I’ll do—in fact I’ll do as well as any one I know.
她洗了澡，抹了油，在身上涂了一层粉，脚趾踩着浴巾，踩着另一堆粉。她用显微镜观察自己侧腹的线条，想知道这座精致、纤细的大厦多久才会开始向地面下沉。大约六年后，但现在我会做到——事实上，我会做得和我认识的任何人一样好。

She was not exaggerating. The only physical disparity between Nicole at present and the Nicole of five years before was simply that she was no longer a young girl. But she was enough ridden by the current youth worship, the moving pictures with their myriad faces of girl-children, blandly represented as carrying on the work and wisdom of the world, to feel a jealousy of youth.
她并没有夸张。现在的妮可与五年前的妮可唯一的外貌差距，只是她不再是少女了。但她已经被当前的青年崇拜所困扰，那些有着无数女孩面孔的电影，温和地表现出承担着世界的工作和智慧，让她感到对青年的嫉妒。

She put on the first ankle-length day dress that she had owned for many years, and crossed herself reverently with Chanel Sixteen. When Tommy drove up at one o’clock she had made her person into the trimmest of gardens.
她穿上了她拥有多年的第一件及踝日间礼服，并虔诚地在香奈儿十六号上画了十字。当汤米一点钟开车过来时，她已经把人带进了最整洁的花园里。

How good to have things like this, to be worshipped again, to pretend to have a mystery! She had lost two of the great arrogant years in the life of a pretty girl—now she felt like making up for them; she greeted Tommy as if he were one of many men at her feet, walking ahead of him instead of beside him as they crossed the garden toward the market umbrella. Attractive women of nineteen and of twenty-nine are alike in their breezy confidence; on the contrary, the exigent womb of the twenties does not pull the outside world centripetally around itself. The former are ages of insolence, comparable the one to a young cadet, the other to a fighter strutting after combat.
拥有这样的东西，再次受到崇拜，假装有神秘感，该多好啊！作为一个漂亮女孩，她失去了生命中最傲慢的两年——现在她想弥补；当他们穿过花园走向市场雨伞时，她向汤米打招呼，就好像他是她脚下的众多男人中的一员一样，走在他前面，而不是在他旁边。十九岁和二十九岁的有魅力的女人都同样充满自信。相反，二十多岁的子宫并不会将外部世界拉向自身。前者是傲慢的年龄，一个可以比作年轻的学员，另一个可以比作战斗结束后昂首阔步的战士。

But whereas a girl of nineteen draws her confidence from a surfeit of attention, a woman of twenty-nine is nourished on subtler stuff. Desirous, she chooses her apéritifs wisely, or, content, she enjoys the caviare of potential power. Happily she does not seem, in either case, to anticipate the subsequent years when her insight will often be blurred by panic, by the fear of stopping or the fear of going on. But on the landings of nineteen or twenty-nine she is pretty sure that there are no bears in the hall.
但是，十九岁的女孩从过度的关注中获得自信，而二十九岁的女人则靠更微妙的东西来滋养。出于渴望，她明智地选择开胃酒，或者，满足于她享受潜在力量的鱼子酱。令人高兴的是，无论哪种情况，她似乎都没有预见到在接下来的几年里，她的洞察力常常会因恐慌、害怕停止或害怕继续而变得模糊。但在十九或二十九的楼梯平台上，她非常确定大厅里没有熊。

Nicole did not want any vague spiritual romance—she wanted an ‘affair”; she wanted a change. She realized, thinking with Dick’s thoughts, that from a superficial view it was a vulgar business to enter, without emotion, into an indulgence that menaced all of them. On the other hand, she blamed Dick for the immediate situation, and honestly thought that such an experiment might have a therapeutic value. All summer she had been stimulated by watching people do exactly what they were tempted to do and pay no penalty for it—moreover, in spite of her intention of no longer lying to herself, she preferred to consider that she was merely feeling her way and that at any moment she could withdraw... .
妮可不想要任何模糊的精神浪漫——她想要一段“外遇”；她想要改变。她意识到，按照迪克的想法，从表面上看，不带感情地陷入一种威胁到所有人的放纵行为是一件庸俗的事情。另一方面，她将眼前的情况归咎于迪克，并真诚地认为这样的实验可能具有治疗价值。整个夏天，她都因为看到人们完全按照他们想做的事情做而不受惩罚而受到刺激——此外，尽管她不想再对自己撒谎，但她更愿意认为自己只是在摸索，并且不会为此付出任何代价。她随时都可以撤退……

In the light shade Tommy caught her up in his white-duck arms and pulled her around to him, looking at her eyes.
在浅色的阴影中，汤米用白鸭般的双臂抱住她，把她拉到自己身边，看着她的眼睛。

‘Don’t move,’ he said. ‘I’m going to look at you a great deal from now on.’
“别动，”他说。 “从现在开始我会经常看着你。”

There was some scent on his hair, a faint aura of soap from his white clothes. Her lips were tight, not smiling and they both simply looked for a moment.
他的头发上有一些香味，白色的衣服上有淡淡的肥皂味。她的嘴唇紧闭，没有微笑，两人只是看了一会儿。

‘Do you like what you see?’ she murmured.
“你喜欢你所看到的吗？”她低声说道。

‘Parle français.’
“法语演讲。”

‘Very well,’ and she asked again in French. ‘Do you like what you see?’
“很好，”她又用法语问道。 '你喜欢你看到的吗？'

He pulled her closer.
他把她拉得更近。

‘I like whatever I see about you.’ He hesitated. ‘I thought I knew your face but it seems there are some things I didn’t know about it. When did you begin to have white crook’s eyes?’
“我喜欢你身上的一切。”他犹豫了一下。 “我以为我认识你的脸，但似乎有些事情我不知道。”你什么时候开始有白色的鹰眼？

She broke away, shocked and indignant, and cried in English:
她挣脱开来，震惊又愤怒，用英语哭道：

‘Is that why you wanted to talk French?’ Her voice quieted as the butler came with sherry. ‘So you could be offensive more accurately?’
“这就是你想说法语的原因吗？”当管家端着雪利酒过来时，她的声音平静下来。 “那么你的攻击性可以更准确一些吗？”

She parked her small seat violently on the cloth-of-silver chair cushion.
她猛烈地将小座位停在银布椅垫上。

‘I have no mirror here,’ she said, again in French, but decisively, ‘but if my eyes have changed it’s because I’m well again. And being well perhaps I’ve gone back to my true self—I suppose my grandfather was a crook and I’m a crook by heritage, so there we are. Does that satisfy your logical mind?’
“我这里没有镜子，”她又用法语说道，但语气坚决，“但如果我的眼睛变了，那是因为我又好了。”身体健康后，也许我已经回到了真实的自我——我想我的祖父是个骗子，我也是个骗子，所以我们就这样了。这满足你的逻辑思维吗？

He scarcely seemed to know what she was talking about.
他似乎几乎不知道她在说什么。

‘Where’s Dick—is he lunching with us?’
“迪克在哪儿——他在和我们一起吃午饭吗？”

Seeing that his remark had meant comparatively little to him she suddenly laughed away its effect.
看到他的话对他来说意义不大，她突然一笑置之。

‘Dick’s on a tour,’ she said. ‘Rosemary Hoyt turned up, and either they’re together or she upset him so much that he wants to go away and dream about her.’
“迪克正在巡演，”她说。 “罗斯玛丽·霍伊特出现了，要么他们在一起，要么她让他非常不安，以至于他想离开并梦见她。”

‘You know, you’re a little complicated after all.’
“你知道，你毕竟有点复杂。”

‘Oh no,’ she assured him hastily. ‘No, I’m not really—I’m just a— I’m just a whole lot of different simple people.’
“哦，不，”她急忙向他保证。 “不，我不是真的——我只是——我只是一群不同的简单人。”

Marius brought out melon and an ice pail, and Nicole, thinking irresistibly about her crook’s eyes did not answer; he gave one an entire nut to crack, this man, instead of giving it in fragments to pick at for meat.
马吕斯拿出了甜瓜和一个冰桶，妮可不可抗拒地想着她骗子的眼睛，没有回答。他给了这个人一整颗坚果来敲碎，而不是把它分成碎片来挑选肉。

‘Why didn’t they leave you in your natural state?’ Tommy demanded presently. ‘You are the most dramatic person I have known.’
“他们为什么不让你保持自然状态？”汤米立即问道。 “你是我认识的最富有戏剧性的人。”

She had no answer.
她没有答案。

‘All this taming of women!’ he scoffed.
“所有这些对女人的驯服！”他嘲笑道。

‘In any society there are certain—‘ She felt Dick’s ghost prompting at her elbow but she subsided at Tommy’s overtone:
“在任何社会中，都有一定的——”她感觉到迪克的鬼魂在她身边提示，但听到汤米的暗示，她平静了下来：

‘I’ve brutalized many men into shape but I wouldn’t take a chance on half the number of women. Especially this ‘kind’ bullying—what good does it do anybody?—you or him or anybody?’
“我已经残酷地折磨了很多男人，但我不会在一半的女人身上冒险。尤其是这种“善意”的欺凌行为——这对任何人有什么好处？——你、他还是任何人？

Her heart leaped and then sank faintly with a sense of what she owed Dick.
她的心猛地一跳，然后又微沉地沉下去，因为她意识到自己欠迪克什么。

‘I suppose I’ve got—‘
“我想我已经——”

‘You’ve got too much money,’ he said impatiently. ‘That’s the crux of the matter. Dick can’t beat that.’
“你的钱太多了。”他不耐烦地说。 ‘这就是问题的关键。迪克无法战胜这一点。

She considered while the melons were removed.
她边思考边把瓜拿走。

‘What do you think I ought to do?’
“你认为我应该做什么？”

For the first time in ten years she was under the sway of a personality other than her husband’s. Everything Tommy said to her became part of her forever.
十年来，她第一次受到丈夫以外的人格的影响。汤米对她说的一切都永远成为她的一部分。

They drank the bottle of wine while a faint wind rocked the pine needles and the sensuous heat of early afternoon made blinding freckles on the checkered luncheon cloth. Tommy came over behind her and laid his arms along hers, clasping her hands. Their cheeks touched and then their lips and she gasped half with passion for him, half with the sudden surprise of its force... .
他们喝了一瓶酒，微风吹动着松针，午后的炎热在格子午餐布上留下了令人眼花缭乱的雀斑。汤米走到她身后，将双臂放在她的手臂上，紧握着她的双手。他们的脸颊碰在一起，然后是嘴唇，她喘着粗气，一半是因为对他的热情，一半是因为它的力量突然令人惊讶……。

‘Can’t you send the governess and the children away for the afternoon?’
“你不能把家庭女教师和孩子们送走吗？”

‘They have a piano lesson. Anyhow I don’t want to stay here.’
“他们有钢琴课。无论如何，我不想留在这里。

‘Kiss me again.’
'再吻我一次。'

A little later, riding toward Nice, she thought: So I have white crook’s eyes, have I? Very well then, better a sane crook than a mad puritan.
过了一会儿，在骑马前往尼斯的路上，她想：这么说我的眼睛是白色的，是吗？那么好吧，做一个理智的骗子比做一个疯狂的清教徒要好。

His assertion seemed to absolve her from all blame or responsibility and she had a thrill of delight in thinking of herself in a new way. New vistas appeared ahead, peopled with the faces of many men, none of whom she need obey or even love. She drew in her breath, hunched her shoulders with a wriggle and turned to Tommy.
他的断言似乎免除了她所有的责备或责任，她因以新的方式思考自己而感到一阵兴奋。新的景象出现在前方，上面有许多男人的面孔，而她不需要服从任何一个人，甚至不需要爱。她吸了一口气，耸起肩膀，转向汤米。

‘Have we GOT to go all the way to your hotel at Monte Carlo?’
“我们必须一路去你们在蒙特卡洛的酒店吗？”

He brought the car to a stop with a squeak of tires.
他把车停了下来，轮胎发出吱吱的声音。

‘No!’ he answered. ‘And, my God, I have never been so happy as I am this minute.’
“不！”他回答道。 “而且，天哪，我从来没有像这一刻这么高兴过。”

They had passed through Nice following the blue coast and begun to mount to the middling-high Corniche. Now Tommy turned sharply down to the shore, ran out a blunt peninsula, and stopped in the rear of a small shore hotel.
他们沿着蓝色海岸穿过尼斯，开始爬上中高的滨海大道。现在汤米急速转向海岸，跑出一个陡峭的半岛，停在一家海岸小旅馆的后面。

Its tangibility frightened Nicole for a moment. At the desk an American was arguing interminably with the clerk about the rate of exchange. She hovered, outwardly tranquil but inwardly miserable, as Tommy filled out the police blanks—his real, hers false. Their room was a Mediterranean room, almost ascetic, almost clean, darkened to the glare of the sea. Simplest of pleasures—simplest of places. Tommy ordered two cognacs, and when the door closed behind the waiter, he sat in the only chair, dark, scarred and handsome, his eyebrows arched and upcurling, a fighting Puck, an earnest Satan.
它的有形性让妮可一时感到害怕。柜台前，一个美国人正在与店员就汇率问题无休无止地争论。她徘徊着，表面平静，但内心痛苦，汤米填写了警察的空白——他是真的，她是假的。他们的房间是一间地中海风格的房间，几乎是禁欲主义的，几乎是干净的，在大海的照射下显得很暗。最简单的乐趣——最简单的地方。汤米点了两杯干邑白兰地，当侍者身后的门关上时，他坐在唯一的椅子上，皮肤黝黑，伤痕累累，英俊潇洒，眉毛拱起，向上卷曲，就像一个好斗的帕克，一个认真的撒旦。

Before they had finished the brandy they suddenly moved together and met standing up; then they were sitting on the bed and he kissed her hardy knees. Struggling a little still, like a decapitated animal she forgot about Dick and her new white eyes, forgot Tommy himself and sank deeper and deeper into the minutes and the moment.
还没等他们喝完白兰地，他们突然凑在一起，站了起来。然后他们坐在床上，他吻了她坚硬的膝盖。她像一头被斩首的动物一样挣扎着，忘记了迪克和她那双新的白色眼睛，忘记了汤米本人，越来越深地沉浸在时间和时刻中。

... When he got up to open a shutter and find out what caused the increasing clamor below their windows, his figure was darker and stronger than Dick’s, with high lights along the rope-twists of muscle. Momentarily he had forgotten her too—almost in the second of his flesh breaking from hers she had a foretaste that things were going to be different than she had expected. She felt the nameless fear which precedes all emotions, joyous or sorrowful, inevitable as a hum of thunder precedes a storm.
……当他起身打开百叶窗，查明是什么原因导致窗下的喧闹声越来越大时，他的身影比迪克的更黑、更强壮，强光沿着绳索缠绕的肌肉。一时之间，他也忘记了她——几乎在他的肉体与她的肉体分离的那一刻，她就预感到事情将会与她预想的不同。她感到一种无名的恐惧，这种恐惧出现在所有情绪之前，无论是快乐还是悲伤，就像暴风雨之前的雷声一样不可避免。

Tommy peered cautiously from the balcony and reported.
汤米在阳台上小心翼翼地观察并报告。

‘All I can see is two women on the balcony below this. They’re talking about weather and tipping back and forth in American rocking-chairs.’
“我只能看到下面阳台上有两个女人。他们正在谈论天气，并在美国摇椅上来回摇晃。

‘Making all that noise?’
“发出那么大的噪音？”

‘The noise is coming from somewhere below them. Listen.’
“噪音是从他们下面的某个地方传来的。听。'

“Oh, way down South in the land of cotton
“哦，在南方的棉花之乡

Hotels bum and business rotten
酒店流浪汉和生意腐烂

Look away—‘
把目光移开——’

‘It’s Americans.’
“是美国人。”

Nicole flung her arms wide on the bed and stared at the ceiling; the powder had dampened on her to make a milky surface. She liked the bareness of the room, the sound of the single fly navigating overhead. Tommy brought the chair over to the bed and swept the clothes off it to sit down; she liked the economy of the weightless dress and espadrilles that mingled with his ducks upon the floor.
妮可在床上张开双臂，盯着天花板。粉末在她身上沾湿，形成乳白色的表面。她喜欢空旷的房间，喜欢那只苍蝇在头顶飞过的声音。汤米把椅子搬到床边，扫掉上面的衣服坐下。她喜欢那种经济实惠的轻便连衣裙和麻底鞋，它们与地板上的鸭子混在一起。

He inspected the oblong white torso joined abruptly to the brown limbs and head, and said, laughing gravely:
他检查了一下与棕色四肢和头部突然相连的长方形白色躯干，严肃地笑道：

‘You are all new like a baby.’
“你们就像个婴儿一样焕然一新。”

‘With white eyes.’
“有白色的眼睛。”

‘I’ll take care of that.’
“我会处理的。”

‘It’s very hard taking care of white eyes—especially the ones made in Chicago.’
“照顾白眼睛非常困难，尤其是芝加哥制造的眼睛。”

‘I know all the old Languedoc peasant remedies.’
“我知道所有古老的朗格多克农民疗法。”

‘Kiss me, on the lips, Tommy.’
“汤米，吻我的嘴唇。”

‘That’s so American,’ he said, kissing her nevertheless. ‘When I was in America last there were girls who would tear you apart with their lips, tear themselves too, until their faces were scarlet with the blood around the lips all brought out in a patch—but nothing further.’
“这太美国式了，”他一边说，一边亲吻了她。 “我上次去美国的时候，有些女孩会用嘴唇把你撕碎，也撕碎自己，直到她们的脸变成猩红色，嘴唇周围的血全部流出来——但仅此而已。”

Nicole leaned up on one elbow.
妮可用一只手肘撑起身体。

‘I like this room,’ she said.
“我喜欢这个房间，”她说。

‘I find it somewhat meagre. Darling, I’m glad you wouldn’t wait until we got to Monte Carlo.’
‘我觉得有点微不足道。亲爱的，我很高兴你没有等到我们到达蒙特卡洛。

‘Why only meagre? Why, this is a wonderful room, Tommy—like the bare tables in so many Cézannes and Picassos.’
‘为什么只有一点点？为什么，这是一个很棒的房间，汤米——就像许多塞尚和毕加索作品中光秃秃的桌子一样。

‘I don’t know.’ He did not try to understand her. ‘There’s that noise again. My God, has there been a murder?’
“我不知道。”他并没有试图去理解她。 ‘又是那种声音。天哪，发生了谋杀案吗？

He went to the window and reported once more:
他走到窗前，再次报告：

‘It seems to be two American sailors fighting and a lot more cheering them on. They are from your battleship off shore.’ He wrapped a towel around himself and went farther out on the balcony. ‘They have poules with them. I have heard about this now—the women follow them from place to place wherever the ship goes. But what women! One would think with their pay they could find better women! Why the women who followed Korniloff! Why we never looked at anything less than a ballerina!’
“似乎是两名美国水手在战斗，还有更多人在为他们加油。它们是从你们离岸的战舰上来的。”他裹了一条毛巾，走到更远的阳台上。 “他们带着小包。”我现在听说了这件事——无论船到哪里，妇女们都跟着他们从一个地方到另一个地方。但女人啊！人们会认为，以他们的薪水，他们可以找到更好的女人！为什么那些女人追随科尔尼洛夫！为什么我们从来不看芭蕾舞演员以外的任何东西！

Nicole was glad he had known so many women, so that the word itself meant nothing to him; she would be able to hold him so long as the person in her transcended the universals of her body.
妮可很高兴他认识了这么多女人，所以这个词本身对他来说毫无意义。只要她体内的这个人超越了她身体的普遍性，她就能够抱着他。

‘Hit him where it hurts!’
“打他痛处！”

‘Yah-h-h-h!’
“啊啊啊啊！”

‘Hey, what I tell you get inside that right!’
“嘿，我告诉你的就进去吧！”

‘Come on, Dulschmit, you son!’
“来吧，杜尔施密特，你的儿子！”

‘YAA-YAA!’
“呀呀呀！”

‘YA-YEH-YAH!’
“耶-耶-耶！”

Tommy turned away.
汤米转身走开。

‘This place seems to have outlived its usefulness, you agree?’
“这个地方似乎已经不再有用了，你同意吗？”

She agreed, but they clung together for a moment before dressing, and then for a while longer it seemed as good enough a palace as any... .
她同意了，但他们在穿衣前抱在一起了一会儿，然后又过了一​​会儿，这似乎和任何一座宫殿一样好……

Dressing at last Tommy exclaimed:
汤米终于穿好衣服，大声说道：

‘MY GOD, those two women in the rocking-chairs on the balcony below us haven’t moved. They’re trying to talk this matter out of existence. They’re here on an economical holiday, and all the American navy and all the whores in Europe couldn’t spoil it.’
“天哪，我们下面阳台上摇椅上的那两个女人还没动。”他们试图让这件事不存在。他们来这里度经济实惠的假期，所有美国海军和所有欧洲妓女都无法破坏它。”

He came over gently and surrounded her, pulling the shoulder strap of her slip into place with his teeth; then a sound split the air outside: Cr-ACK—BOOM-M-m-m! It was the battleship sounding a recall.
他轻轻走过来，将她包围起来，用牙齿将她衬裙的肩带拉到位；然后外面传来一声声音：Cr-ACK——BOOM-M-m-m！那是战列舰发出召回声。

Now, down below their window, it was pandemonium indeed—for the boat was moving to shores as yet unannounced. Waiters called accounts and demanded settlements in impassioned voices, there were oaths and denials; the tossing of bills too large and change too small; passouts were assisted to the boats, and the voices of the naval police chopped with quick commands through all voices. There were cries, tears, shrieks, promises as the first launch shoved off and the women crowded forward on the wharf, screaming and waving.
现在，在他们的窗下，确实是一片混乱——因为船尚未通知就已驶向海岸。服务员们热情洋溢地查帐、要求结算，有宣誓的，也有否认的；扔的钞票太大而零钱太小；通行人员被协助上船，海军警察的声音在所有人的声音中迅速发出命令。当第一艘汽艇驶出时，妇女们挤在码头上，尖叫着、挥手致意，到处都是哭声、泪水、尖叫声和承诺。

Tommy saw a girl rush out upon the balcony below waving a napkin, and before he could see whether or not the rocking Englishwomen gave in at last and acknowledged her presence, there was a knock at their own door. Outside, excited female voices made them agree to unlock it, disclosing two girls, young, thin and barbaric, unfound rather than lost, in the hall. One of them wept chokingly.
汤米看到一个女孩冲到下面的阳台上，挥舞着餐巾，还没来得及看看那些摇摆不定的英国女人是否最终屈服并承认了她的存在，有人敲响了她们自己的门。外面，兴奋的女声让他们同意打开门，发现大厅里有两个年轻、瘦弱、野蛮的女孩，她们没有被发现，而是失踪了。其中一人哽咽地哭了起来。

‘Kwee wave off your porch?’ implored the other in passionate American. ‘Kwee please? Wave at the boy friends? Kwee, please. The other rooms is all locked.’
“请从你的门廊上挥手吧？”另一个人用热情的美国语恳求道。 ‘奎，请吗？向男朋友挥手？奎，请。其他房间都锁着。”

‘With pleasure,’ Tommy said.
“很高兴，”汤米说。

The girls rushed out on the balcony and presently their voices struck a loud treble over the din.
女孩们冲到阳台上，不久她们的声音就在喧闹声中响起了高音。

‘‘By, Charlie! Charlie, look UP!’
”“查理！查理，抬头看！

‘Send a wire gen’al alivery Nice!’
“寄一封电报，很好！”

‘Charlie! He don’t see me.’
‘查理！他没有看到我。

One of the girls hoisted her skirt suddenly, pulled and ripped at her pink step-ins and tore them to a sizable flag; then, screaming ‘Ben! Ben!’ she waved it wildly. As Tommy and Nicole left the room it still fluttered against the blue sky. Oh, say can you see the tender color of remembered flesh?—while at the stern of the battleship arose in rivalry the Star-Spangled Banner.
其中一个女孩突然掀起裙子，拉扯并撕扯她的粉红色踏板，将它们撕成一面相当大的旗帜；然后，尖叫着‘本！本！”她疯狂地挥舞着它。当汤米和妮可离开房间时，它仍然在蓝天上飘扬。哦，你能看到记忆中肉体的温柔颜色吗？——而在战舰的船尾，星条旗永不落地升起。

They dined at the new Beach Casino at Monte Carlo ... much later they swam in Beaulieu in a roofless cavern of white moonlight formed by a circlet of pale boulders about a cup of phosphorescent water, facing Monaco and the blur of Mentone. She liked his bringing her there to the eastward vision and the novel tricks of wind and water; it was all as new as they were to each other. Symbolically she lay across his saddle-bow as surely as if he had wolfed her away from Damascus and they had come out upon the Mongolian plain. Moment by moment all that Dick had taught her fell away and she was ever nearer to what she had been in the beginning, prototype of that obscure yielding up of swords that was going on in the world about her. Tangled with love in the moonlight she welcomed the anarchy of her lover.
他们在蒙特卡洛的新海滩赌场用餐……很久以后，他们在博利厄的一个没有屋顶的洞穴里游泳，白色的月光由一圈苍白的巨石围绕着一杯磷光的水形成，面向摩纳哥和模糊的蒙托内。她喜欢他带她去东方的视野和风水的新奇花样；一切都像他们彼此一样陌生。象征性地，她躺在他的马鞍弓上，就好像他把她从大马士革狼吞虎咽地带走了，他们来到了蒙古平原上。迪克教给她的一切都在一刻一刻地消失，她越来越接近她最初的样子，她周围的世界正在发生的那种模糊的交出剑的原型。月光下，她与爱情纠缠不清，她欢迎情人的无政府状态。

They awoke together finding the moon gone down and the air cool. She struggled up demanding the time and Tommy called it roughly at three.
他们一起醒来，发现月亮已经落下，空气凉爽。她挣扎着要求时间，汤米大约在三点钟报时。

‘I’ve got to go home then.’
“那我得回家了。”

‘I thought we’d sleep in Monte Carlo.’
“我以为我们会睡在蒙特卡洛。”

‘No. There’s a governess and the children. I’ve got to roll in before daylight.’
'不。有家庭教师和孩子们。我必须在天亮之前赶到。

‘As you like.’
'随你便。'

They dipped for a second, and when he saw her shivering he rubbed her briskly with a towel. As they got into the car with their heads still damp, their skins fresh and glowing, they were loath to start back. It was very bright where they were and as Tommy kissed her she felt him losing himself in the whiteness of her cheeks and her white teeth and her cool brow and the hand that touched his face. Still attuned to Dick, she waited for interpretation or qualification; but none was forthcoming. Reassured sleepily and happily that none would be, she sank low in the seat and drowsed until the sound of the motor changed and she felt them climbing toward Villa Diana. At the gate she kissed him an almost automatic good-by. The sound of her feet on the walk was changed, the night noises of the garden were suddenly in the past but she was glad, none the less, to be back. The day had progressed at a staccato rate, and in spite of its satisfactions she was not habituated to such strain.
他们浸了一会儿，当他看到她在发抖时，他用毛巾轻快地擦了擦她。当他们钻进车里时，头上还湿漉漉的，皮肤清新、容光焕发，他们都不愿再往回走。他们所在的地方非常明亮，当汤米吻她时，她感觉到他迷失在她白皙的脸颊、洁白的牙齿、冰冷的眉毛和抚摸他脸庞的手中。她仍然与迪克保持一致，等待着解释或限定。但没有任何进展。她睡眼惺忪、高兴地确信没有人会这么做，于是她在座位上低沉地睡着，直到发动机的声音变了，她感觉到他们正在向戴安娜别墅爬去。在门口，她几乎是自动吻了他，道别。她走在路上的脚步声变了，花园里夜晚的喧闹突然过去了，但她还是很高兴能回来。这一天过得断断续续，尽管她很满意，但她并不习惯这种紧张。

IX

At four o’clock next afternoon a station taxi stopped at the gate and Dick got out. Suddenly off balance, Nicole ran from the terrace to meet him, breathless with her effort at self-control.
第二天下午四点，一辆车站出租车停在门口，迪克下了车。妮可突然失去了平衡，从露台跑出来迎接他，她努力控制自己，气喘吁吁。

‘Where’s the car?’ she asked.
“车在哪儿？”她问。

‘I left it in Arles. I didn’t feel like driving any more.’
“我把它留在阿尔勒了。我不想再开车了。

‘I thought from your note that you’d be several days.’
“我从你的字条中得知你需要好几天的时间。”

‘I ran into a mistral and some rain.’
“我遇到了密斯塔拉风和一些雨。”

‘Did you have fun?’
'你玩的开心吗？'

‘Just as much fun as anybody has running away from things. I drove Rosemary as far as Avignon and put her on her train there.’ They walked toward the terrace together, where he deposited his bag. ‘I didn’t tell you in the note because I thought you’d imagine a lot of things.’
“就像任何人逃避事物一样有趣。我开车送罗斯玛丽到阿维尼翁，然后把她送上火车。”他们一起走向露台，他把包放在那里。 “我没有在便条中告诉你，因为我以为你会想象很多事情。”

‘That was very considerate of you.’ Nicole felt surer of herself now.
“你真是太体贴了。”妮可现在对自己更有信心了。

‘I wanted to find out if she had anything to offer—the only way was to see her alone.’
“我想知道她是否有什么可以提供的——唯一的方法就是单独见她。”

‘Did she have—anything to offer?’
“她有——什么东西可以提供吗？”

‘Rosemary didn’t grow up,’ he answered. ‘It’s probably better that way. What have you been doing?’
“罗斯玛丽没有长大，”他回答道。 ‘这样可能会更好。你这阵子都在干什么？'

She felt her face quiver like a rabbit’s.
她感觉自己的脸像兔子一样颤抖。

‘I went dancing last night—with Tommy Barban. We went—‘
“昨晚我和汤米·巴尔班一起去跳舞。我们去了-'

He winced, interrupting her.
他皱起眉头，打断了她的话。

‘Don’t tell me about it. It doesn’t matter what you do, only I don’t want to know anything definitely.’
‘别告诉我这件事。你做什么并不重要，只是我不想确切地知道任何事情。

‘There isn’t anything to know.’
“没有什么可知道的。”

‘All right, all right.’ Then as if he had been away a week: ‘How are the children?’
“好吧，好吧。”然后就好像他已经离开了一个星期一样：“孩子们怎么样？”

The phone rang in the house.
屋里的电话响了。

‘If it’s for me I’m not home,’ said Dick turning away quickly. ‘I’ve got some things to do over in the work-room.’
“如果是为了我，我就不在家。”迪克说着迅速转身走开。 “我在工作室还有一些事情要做。”

Nicole waited till he was out of sight behind the well; then she went into the house and took up the phone.
妮可一直等到他消失在井后的视线中。然后她进屋拿起电话。

‘Nicole, comment vas-tu?’
“妮可，评论一下？”

‘Dick’s home.’
“迪克在家。”

He groaned.
他呻吟着。

‘Meet me here in Cannes,’ he suggested. ‘I’ve got to talk to you.’
“在戛纳见我，”他建议道。 “我得跟你谈谈。”

‘I can’t.’
“我不能。”

‘Tell me you love me.’ Without speaking she nodded at the receiver; he repeated, ‘Tell me you love me.’
“告诉我你爱我。”她没有说话，对着听筒点点头。他重复道：“告诉我你爱我。”

‘Oh, I do,’ she assured him. ‘But there’s nothing to be done right now.’
“哦，我愿意，”她向他保证。 “但现在没有什么可做的。”

‘Of course there is,’ he said impatiently. ‘Dick sees it’s over between you two—it’s obvious he has quit. What does he expect you to do?’
“当然有，”他不耐烦地说。 “迪克看到你们两个之间已经结束了——很明显他已经退出了。他希望你做什么？

‘I don’t know. I’ll have to—‘ She stopped herself from saying ‘—to wait until I can ask Dick,’ and instead finished with: ‘I’ll write and I’ll phone you to-morrow.’
'我不知道。我必须——”她没有说“——等到我可以问迪克”，而是说：“我会写信，明天给你打电话。”

She wandered about the house rather contentedly, resting on her achievement. She was a mischief, and that was a satisfaction; no longer was she a huntress of corralled game. Yesterday came back to her now in innumerable detail—detail that began to overlay her memory of similar moments when her love for Dick was fresh and intact. She began to slight that love, so that it seemed to have been tinged with sentimental habit from the first. With the opportunistic memory of women she scarcely recalled how she had felt when she and Dick had possessed each other in secret places around the corners of the world, during the month before they were married. Just so had she lied to Tommy last night, swearing to him that never before had she so entirely, so completely, so utterly... .
她心满意足地在屋子里走来走去，为自己的成就而休息。她是个恶作剧，这是一种满足；她不再是圈内猎物的女猎人。现在，昨天的事以无数的细节浮现在她的脑海中——这些细节开始覆盖她对类似时刻的记忆，当时她对迪克的爱是新鲜而完整的。她开始淡化这份爱，以至于它似乎从一开始就带着感伤的习惯。凭借女人的机会主义记忆，她几乎记不起结婚前一个月，当她和迪克在世界各个角落的秘密地点占有对方时，她的感受如何。昨晚她也对汤米撒了谎，向他发誓她以前从未如此完全、如此彻底、如此彻底……。

... then remorse for this moment of betrayal, which so cavalierly belittled a decade of her life, turned her walk toward Dick’s sanctuary.
......然后，对这一刻的背叛的悔恨，如此傲慢地贬低了她生命中的十年，使她转向迪克的庇护所。

Approaching noiselessly she saw him behind his cottage, sitting in a steamer chair by the cliff wall, and for a moment she regarded him silently. He was thinking, he was living a world completely his own and in the small motions of his face, the brow raised or lowered, the eyes narrowed or widened, the lips set and reset, the play of his hands, she saw him progress from phase to phase of his own story spinning out inside him, his own, not hers. Once he clenched his fists and leaned forward, once it brought into his face an expression of torment and despair—when this passed its stamp lingered in his eyes. For almost the first time in her life she was sorry for him—it is hard for those who have once been mentally afflicted to be sorry for those who are well, and though Nicole often paid lip service to the fact that he had led her back to the world she had forfeited, she had thought of him really as an inexhaustible energy, incapable of fatigue—she forgot the troubles she caused him at the moment when she forgot the troubles of her own that had prompted her. That he no longer controlled her—did he know that? Had he willed it all?—she felt as sorry for him as she had sometimes felt for Abe North and his ignoble destiny, sorry as for the helplessness of infants and the old.
她悄无声息地走近，看见他坐在小屋后面，坐在悬崖壁边的一张蒸椅上，沉默地看了他一会儿。他在想，他生活在一个完全属于他自己的世界里，从他脸上的微小动作、眉毛的扬起或下垂、眼睛的眯起或睁大、嘴唇的张开或复位、双手的动作，她看到了他的进步。他自己的故事在他内心一层一层地展开，是他自己的，不是她的。有一次他握紧拳头，身体前倾，有一次他的脸上露出痛苦和绝望的表情——当这一切过去后，它的印记在他的眼中挥之不去。这几乎是她有生以来第一次为他感到难过——对于那些曾经精神受过折磨的人来说，很难为那些健康的人感到难过，尽管妮可经常口头上承认他把她带回来了。对于她所放弃的世界来说，她真的把他视为一种取之不尽、用之不竭的能量，不知疲倦——当她忘记了自己给她带来的麻烦时，她忘记了自己给他带来的麻烦。他不再控制她——他知道吗？这一切都是他自愿的吗？——她为他感到难过，就像她有时为阿贝·诺斯和他不光彩的命运感到难过一样，为婴儿和老人的无助感到难过。

She went up putting her arm around his shoulder and touching their heads together said:
她走上前，用手臂搂住他的肩膀，将他们的头碰在一起说道：

‘Don’t be sad.’
“别伤心。”

He looked at her coldly.
他冷冷地看着她。

‘Don’t touch me!’ he said.
“别碰我！”他说。

Confused she moved a few feet away.
她感到困惑，退到了几英尺远的地方。

‘Excuse me,’ he continued abstractedly. ‘I was just thinking what I thought of you—‘
“对不起，”他心不在焉地继续说道。 “我只是在想我对你的看法——”

‘Why not add the new classification to your book?’
“为什么不将新的分类添加到您的书中呢？”

‘I have thought of it—‘Furthermore and beyond the psychoses and the neuroses—‘’
“我已经想到了——‘此外，超越了精神病和神经症——”

‘I didn’t come over here to be disagreeable.’
“我来这里不是为了惹麻烦。”

‘Then why DID you come, Nicole? I can’t do anything for you any more. I’m trying to save myself.’
“那你为什么来，妮可？我不能再为你做任何事了。我正在努力拯救自己。

‘From my contamination?’
“因为我的污染？”

‘Profession throws me in contact with questionable company sometimes.’
“职业有时会让我接触到有问题的公司。”

She wept with anger at the abuse.
她因虐待而愤怒地哭泣。

‘You’re a coward! You’ve made a failure of your life, and you want to blame it on me.’
‘你是个胆小鬼！你的人生很失败，你还想把责任归咎于我。”

While he did not answer she began to feel the old hypnotism of his intelligence, sometimes exercised without power but always with substrata of truth under truth which she could not break or even crack. Again she struggled with it, fighting him with her small, fine eyes, with the plush arrogance of a top dog, with her nascent transference to another man, with the accumulated resentment of years; she fought him with her money and her faith that her sister disliked him and was behind her now; with the thought of the new enemies he was making with his bitterness, with her quick guile against his wine-ing and dine-ing slowness, her health and beauty against his physical deterioration, her unscrupulousness against his moralities—for this inner battle she used even her weaknesses— fighting bravely and courageously with the old cans and crockery and bottles, empty receptacles of her expiated sins, outrages, mistakes. And suddenly, in the space of two minutes she achieved her victory and justified herself to herself without lie or subterfuge, cut the cord forever. Then she walked, weak in the legs, and sobbing coolly, toward the household that was hers at last.
当他没有回答时，她开始感受到他智力的古老催眠作用，有时在没有力量的情况下发挥作用，但总是以真理为基础，她无法打破甚至破解。她再次与之斗争，用她那双漂亮的小眼睛，用顶级狗的傲慢，用她对另一个男人的新生移情，用多年来积累的怨恨与他作斗争。她用她的钱和她的信念来对抗他，因为她的姐姐不喜欢他，现在支持她了。想到他正在结下的新敌人，想到他的苦毒，想到她的狡诈，对付他喝酒吃饭的缓慢，她的健康和美丽，对付他身体的恶化，她的肆无忌惮，对付他的道德观——为了这场内心的斗争，她用了甚至她的弱点——与旧罐头、陶器和瓶子勇敢地战斗，这些旧罐子、陶器和瓶子是她赎罪、暴行和错误的空容器。突然，在两分钟的时间内，她取得了胜利，并为自己辩护，没有谎言或托词，永远切断了电源线。然后她双腿发软，冷冷地抽泣着，朝终于属于她的家走去。

Dick waited until she was out of sight. Then he leaned his head forward on the parapet. The case was finished. Doctor Diver was at liberty.
迪克一直等到她消失在视线之外。然后他把头向前靠在栏杆上。案子结束了。戴弗医生自由了。

X

At two o’clock that night the phone woke Nicole and she heard Dick answer it from what they called the restless bed, in the next room.
那天晚上两点钟，电话吵醒了妮可，她听到迪克在隔壁房间的那张不安的床上接听电话。

‘Oui, oui ... mais à qui est-ce-que je parle? ... Oui ...’ His voice woke up with surprise. ‘But can I speak to one of the ladies, Sir the Officer? They are both ladies of the very highest prominence, ladies of connections that might cause political complications of the most serious... . It is a fact, I swear to you... . Very well, you will see.’
‘Oui, oui ...mais à qui est-ce-que je parle? ……哎……”他的声音因惊讶而醒来。 “但是我可以和一位女士说话吗，军官先生？她们都是地位最高的女士，她们的关系可能会导致最严重的政治复杂化……。这是事实，我向你发誓......很好，你会看到的。

He got up and, as he absorbed the situation, his self-knowledge assured him that he would undertake to deal with it—the old fatal pleasingness, the old forceful charm, swept back with its cry of ‘Use me!’ He would have to go fix this thing that he didn’t care a damn about, because it had early become a habit to be loved, perhaps from the moment when he had realized that he was the last hope of a decaying clan. On an almost parallel occasion, back in Dohmler’s clinic on the Zurichsee, realizing this power, he had made his choice, chosen Ophelia, chosen the sweet poison and drunk it. Wanting above all to be brave and kind, he had wanted, even more than that, to be loved. So it had been. So it would ever be, he saw, simultaneously with the slow archaic tinkle from the phone box as he rang off.
他站起来，当他吸收了当前的情况后，他的自知之明向他保证，他会着手处理它——过去的致命的愉悦感，过去的强大魅力，带着“利用我！”的呼喊卷土重来。去修复这个他根本不在乎的东西，因为这早已成为一种被爱的习惯，也许从他意识到自己是一个衰落家族的最后希望的那一刻起。几乎在同一时刻，回到苏黎世湖的多姆勒诊所，意识到这种力量，他做出了选择，选择了奥菲莉亚，选择了甜蜜的毒药并喝下了它。他首先想要的是勇敢和善良，更重要的是，他想要被爱。确实如此。他看到，当他挂断电话时，电话亭里传来缓慢而陈旧的叮当声，一切都会如此。

There was a long pause. Nicole called, ‘What is it? Who is it?’
出现了长时间的停顿。妮可喊道：“什么事？”是谁？'

Dick had begun to dress even as he hung up the phone.
迪克挂断电话时已经开始穿衣服了。

‘It’s the poste de police in Antibes—they’re holding Mary North and that Sibley-Biers. It’s something serious—the agent wouldn’t tell me; he kept saying ‘pas de mortes—pas d’automobiles’ but he implied it was just about everything else.’
“这是安提比斯的警察哨所——他们扣留了玛丽·诺斯和那个西布利·比尔。这件事很严重——代理人不肯告诉我；他一直说“pas de mortes——pas d’automobiles”，但他暗示这就是其他一切。

‘Why on earth did they call on YOU? It sounds very peculiar to me.’
‘他们到底为什么要找你？这对我来说听起来很奇怪。

‘They’ve got to get out on bail to save their faces; and only some property owner in the Alpes Maritimes can give bail.’
“他们必须保释才能保住自己的面子；只有滨海阿尔卑斯省的一些业主可以提供保释。

‘They had their nerve.’
“他们有勇气。”

‘I don’t mind. However I’ll pick up Gausse at the hotel—‘
‘我不介意。不过我会去酒店接高斯——”

Nicole stayed awake after he had departed wondering what offense they could have committed; then she slept. A little after three when Dick came in she sat up stark awake saying, ‘What?’ as if to a character in her dream.
他离开后，妮可一直睡不着，想知道他们可能犯了什么罪。然后她睡了。三点刚过，迪克进来时，她猛地坐起来，问道：“什么？”就像是在对梦中的角色说话一样。

‘It was an extraordinary story—‘ Dick said. He sat on the foot of her bed, telling her how he had roused old Gausse from an Alsatian coma, told him to clean out his cash drawer, and driven with him to the police station.
“这是一个非凡的故事——”迪克说。他坐在她的床脚上，告诉她他如何将老高斯从阿尔萨斯昏迷中唤醒，让他清理现金抽屉，然后开车送他去了警察局。

‘I don’t like to do something for that Anglaise,’ Gausse grumbled.
“我不想为那个英国人做点什么，”高斯抱怨道。

Mary North and Lady Caroline, dressed in the costume of French sailors, lounged on a bench outside the two dingy cells. The latter had the outraged air of a Briton who momentarily expected the Mediterranean fleet to steam up to her assistance. Mary Minghetti was in a condition of panic and collapse—she literally flung herself at Dick’s stomach as though that were the point of greatest association, imploring him to do something. Meanwhile the chief of police explained the matter to Gausse who listened to each word with reluctance, divided between being properly appreciative of the officer’s narrative gift and showing that, as the perfect servant, the story had no shocking effect on him. ‘It was merely a lark,’ said Lady Caroline with scorn. ‘We were pretending to be sailors on leave, and we picked up two silly girls. They got the wind up and made a rotten scene in a lodging house.’
玛丽·诺斯和卡罗琳夫人穿着法国水手的服装，懒洋洋地坐在两间肮脏牢房外的长凳上。后者有着英国人的愤怒神情，他们一时期望地中海舰队赶来援助她。玛丽·明盖蒂处于恐慌和崩溃的状态——她真的扑向迪克的肚子，仿佛这是最重要的联系点，恳求他做点什么。与此同时，警察局长向高斯解释了这件事，高斯不情愿地听着每一个字，一方面是对警察的叙事天赋表示赞赏，另一方面表明，作为完美的仆人，这个故事对他没有什么令人震惊的影响。 “这不过是闹着玩而已，”卡罗琳夫人轻蔑地说。 “我们假装是休假的水手，我们捡到了两个傻女孩。他们大肆宣扬，在宿舍里制造了一场糟糕的场面。

Dick nodded gravely, looking at the stone floor, like a priest in the confessional—he was torn between a tendency to ironic laughter and another tendency to order fifty stripes of the cat and a fortnight of bread and water. The lack, in Lady Caroline’s face, of any sense of evil, except the evil wrought by cowardly Provençal girls and stupid police, confounded him; yet he had long concluded that certain classes of English people lived upon a concentrated essence of the anti-social that, in comparison, reduced the gorgings of New York to something like a child contracting indigestion from ice cream.
迪克严肃地点点头，看着石头地板，就像忏悔室里的牧师一样——他在一种讽刺性的笑声和另一种点五十条猫和两周的面包和水的倾向之间左右为难。卡罗琳夫人的脸上没有任何邪恶的感觉，除了胆怯的普罗旺斯女孩和愚蠢的警察所造成的邪恶，这让他感到困惑。但他很早就得出结论，某些阶层的英国人生活在反社会的集中本质中，相比之下，纽约的狼吞虎咽就像一个因冰淇淋而消化不良的孩子。

‘I’ve got to get out before Hosain hears about this,’ Mary pleaded. ‘Dick, you can always arrange things—you always could. Tell ‘em we’ll go right home, tell ‘em we’ll pay anything.’
“我必须在侯赛因听到这件事之前离开，”玛丽恳求道。 “迪克，你总是可以安排事情——你总是可以。告诉他们我们会立即回家，告诉他们我们会付出任何代价。

‘I shall not,’ said Lady Caroline disdainfully. ‘Not a shilling. But I shall jolly well find out what the Consulate in Cannes has to say about this.’
“我不会的，”卡罗琳夫人轻蔑地说。 “一先令都没有。”但我很乐意了解驻戛纳领事馆对此有何评论。

‘No, no!’ insisted Mary. ‘We’ve got to get out to-night.’
“不，不！”玛丽坚持道。 “我们今晚必须出去。”

‘I’ll see what I can do,’ said Dick, and added, ‘but money will certainly have to change hands.’ Looking at them as though they were the innocents that he knew they were not, he shook his head: ‘Of all the crazy stunts!’
“我会看看我能做些什么，”迪克说，并补充道，“但是钱肯定会易手。”他看着他们，好像他们是无辜的，他知道他们不是，他摇了摇头：“所有疯狂的特技！

Lady Caroline smiled complacently.
卡罗琳夫人得意地笑了。

‘You’re an insanity doctor, aren’t you? You ought to be able to help us—and Gausse has GOT to!’
‘你是个精神错乱的医生，不是吗？你应该能够帮助我们——高斯必须这么做！”

At this point Dick went aside with Gausse and talked over the old man’s findings. The affair was more serious than had been indicated—one of the girls whom they had picked up was of a respectable family. The family were furious, or pretended to be; a settlement would have to be made with them. The other one, a girl of the port, could be more easily dealt with. There were French statutes that would make conviction punishable by imprisonment or, at the very least, public expulsion from the country. In addition to the difficulties, there was a growing difference in tolerance between such townspeople as benefited by the foreign colony and the ones who were annoyed by the consequent rise of prices. Gausse, having summarized the situation, turned it over to Dick. Dick called the chief of police into conference.
这时，迪克和高斯走到一边，谈论了老人的发现。这件事比所表明的更为严重——他们捡到的其中一个女孩来自一个受人尊敬的家庭。家人很生气，或者假装很生气；必须与他们达成和解。另外一个是港口的女孩，还好对付一些。法国有法律规定，一旦定罪，可处以监禁，或至少公开驱逐出境。除了这些困难之外，受益于外国殖民地的城镇居民和因随之而来的物价上涨而感到恼火的城镇居民之间的容忍度也越来越大。高斯总结了一下情况，交给了迪克。迪克召集警察局长开会。

‘Now you know that the French government wants to encourage American touring—so much so that in Paris this summer there’s an order that Americans can’t be arrested except for the most serious offenses.’
“现在你知道法国政府想要鼓励美国旅游——以至于今年夏天在巴黎有一项命令，除了最严重的罪行之外，不得逮捕美国人。”

‘This is serious enough, my God.’
“天哪，这已经够严重了。”

‘But look now—you have their Cartes d’Identité?’
“但是现在看看——你有他们的身份证明吗？”

‘They had none. They had nothing—two hundred francs and some rings. Not even shoe-laces that they could have hung themselves with!’
“他们没有。”他们什么也没有——两百法郎和一些戒指。连他们可以用来上吊的鞋带都没有！”

Relieved that there had been no Cartes d’Identité Dick continued.
迪克因为没有身份证明而松了口气，继续说道。

‘The Italian Countess is still an American citizen. She is the grand-daughter—‘ he told a string of lies slowly and portentously, ‘of John D. Rockefeller Mellon. You have heard of him?’
“意大利伯爵夫人仍然是美国公民。她是约翰·D·洛克菲勒·梅隆的孙女——”他缓慢而充满预兆地说了一连串谎言。你听说过他吗？

‘Yes, oh heavens, yes. You mistake me for a nobody?’
‘是的，天哪，是的。你误认为我是一个无名小卒？

‘In addition she is the niece of Lord Henry Ford and so connected with the Renault and Citroën companies—‘ He thought he had better stop here. However the sincerity of his voice had begun to affect the officer, so he continued: ‘To arrest her is just as if you arrested a great royalty of England. It might mean—War!’
“此外，她是亨利·福特勋爵的侄女，与雷诺和雪铁龙公司有着如此密切的联系——”他认为他最好就此打住。不过，他声音的真诚已经开始影响了那位军官，于是他继续说道：“逮捕她，就像逮捕了一位伟大的英国皇室一样。”这可能意味着——战争！

‘But how about the Englishwoman?’
“但是那个英国女人呢？”

‘I’m coming to that. She is affianced to the brother of the Prince of Wales—the Duke of Buckingham.’
“我正要说到这一点。她与威尔士亲王的兄弟——白金汉公爵有婚约。

‘She will be an exquisite bride for him.’
“她将成为他的完美新娘。”

‘Now we are prepared to give—‘ Dick calculated quickly, ‘one thousand francs to each of the girls—and an additional thousand to the father of the ‘serious’ one. Also two thousand in addition, for you to distribute as you think best—‘ he shrugged his shoulders, ‘—among the men who made the arrest, the lodging-house keeper and so forth. I shall hand you the five thousand and expect you to do the negotiating immediately. Then they can be released on bail on some charge like disturbing the peace, and whatever fine there is will be paid before the magistrate tomorrow—by messenger.’
“现在我们准备给——”迪克快速算了一下，“给每个女孩一千法郎——另外一千法郎给那个‘认真的’女孩的父亲。另外还有两千人，你可以按照你认为最好的方式分配——”他耸了耸肩，“——在逮捕的人中，宿舍管理员等等。我将把五千交给你，并希望你立即进行谈判。然后，他们可以以扰乱治安等罪名获得保释，无论罚款多少，明天都会由信使在地方法官面前缴纳。

Before the officer spoke Dick saw by his expression that it would be all right. The man said hesitantly, ‘I have made no entry because they have no Cartes d’Identité. I must see—give me the money.’
警官还没开口说话，迪克就从他的表情看出，一切都会好起来的。那人犹豫地说：“我没有登记，因为他们没有身份证明。”我必须看看——给我钱。

An hour later Dick and M. Gausse dropped the women by the Majestic Hotel, where Lady Caroline’s chauffeur slept in her landaulet.
一小时后，迪克和高斯先生把她们送到了大华酒店，卡罗琳女士的司机就睡在她的落地小车里。

‘Remember,’ said Dick, ‘you owe Monsieur Gausse a hundred dollars a piece.’
“记住，”迪克说，“你欠高斯先生每件一百美元。”

‘All right,’ Mary agreed, ‘I’ll give him a check to-morrow—and something more.’
“好吧，”玛丽同意道，“明天我会给他一张支票——还有更多。”

‘Not I!’ Startled, they all turned to Lady Caroline, who, now entirely recovered, was swollen with righteousness. ‘The whole thing was an outrage. By no means did I authorize you to give a hundred dollars to those people.’
“不是我！”他们都大吃一惊，转向卡罗琳夫人，她现在完全康复了，充满了正义感。 '整件事令人愤怒。我绝对没有授权你给那些人一百美元。

Little Gausse stood beside the car, his eyes blazing suddenly.
小高斯站在车旁，眼睛突然放光。

‘You won’t pay me?’
“你不付钱给我吗？”

‘Of course she will,’ said Dick.
“她当然会的，”迪克说。

Suddenly the abuse that Gausse had once endured as a bus boy in London flamed up and he walked through the moonlight up to Lady Caroline.
突然间，高斯在伦敦当公交车男孩时所遭受的虐待突然燃起，他踏着月光走向卡罗琳夫人。

He whipped a string of condemnatory words about her, and as she turned away with a frozen laugh, he took a step after her and swiftly planted his little foot in the most celebrated of targets. Lady Caroline, taken by surprise, flung up her hands like a person shot as her sailor-clad form sprawled forward on the sidewalk.
他对她说了一连串谴责的话，当她冷冷地笑着转过身去时，他在她身后迈出了一步，迅速将小脚踩在了最著名的目标上。卡罗琳女士吃了一惊，她像一个被枪杀的人一样举起双手，她穿着水手服的身体向前倾倒在人行道上。

Dick’s voice cut across her raging: ‘Mary, you quiet her down! or you’ll both be in leg-irons in ten minutes!’
迪克的声音打断了她的愤怒：“玛丽，你让她安静下来！”否则十分钟之内你们都会被戴上脚镣！”

On the way back to the hotel old Gausse said not a word, until they passed the Juan-les-Pins Casino, still sobbing and coughing with jazz; then he sighed forth:
返回旅馆的路上，老高斯一言不发，直到他们经过胡安莱潘赌场，他仍然随着爵士乐抽泣和咳嗽。然后他叹了口气：

‘I have never seen women like this sort of women. I have known many of the great courtesans of the world, and for them I have much respect often, but women like these women I have never seen before.’
“我从来没有见过这样的女人。我认识世界上许多伟大的妓女，我常常对她们非常尊敬，但像这些女人这样的女人我以前从未见过。

XI

Dick and Nicole were accustomed to go together to the barber, and have haircuts and shampoos in adjoining rooms. From Dick’s side Nicole could hear the snip of shears, the count of changes, the Voilàs and Pardons. The day after his return they went down to be shorn and washed in the perfumed breeze of the fans.
迪克和妮可习惯一起去理发店，在相邻的房间理发和洗头。妮可从迪克身边听到剪刀的剪断声、数数变化的声音、“瞧”和“赦免”的声音。他回来后的第二天，他们就下楼去剪毛，并在球迷的芳香微风中清洗。

In front of the Carleton Hotel, its windows as stubbornly blank to the summer as so many cellar doors, a car passed them and Tommy Barban was in it. Nicole’s momentary glimpse of his expression, taciturn and thoughtful and, in the second of seeing her, wide-eyed and alert, disturbed her. She wanted to be going where he was going. The hour with the hair-dresser seemed one of the wasteful intervals that composed her life, another little prison. The coiffeuse in her white uniform, faintly sweating lip-rouge and cologne reminded her of many nurses.
卡尔顿酒店门前，窗户就像许多地窖的门一样，在夏天里顽固地一片空白，一辆汽车驶过，汤米·巴尔班就在车里。妮可瞥见了他沉默寡言、若有所思的表情，而在看到她的那一刻，他睁大了眼睛，警觉起来，这让她感到不安。她想去他要去的地方。和理发师在一起的那一小时似乎是构成她生活的浪费时间之一，就像另一个小监狱。穿着白色制服的理发师，涂着微微出汗的唇彩和古龙水，让她想起了许多护士。

In the next room Dick dozed under an apron and a lather of soap. The mirror in front of Nicole reflected the passage between the men’s side and the women’s, and Nicole started up at the sight of Tommy entering and wheeling sharply into the men’s shop. She knew with a flush of joy that there was going to be some sort of showdown.
在隔壁房间里，迪克围着围裙，涂着肥皂泡沫打瞌睡。妮可面前的镜子映出男装区和女装区之间的通道，看到汤米走进男装店，妮可吓了一跳。她高兴得满脸通红，知道即将有一场对决。

She heard fragments of its beginning.
她听到了故事开头的一些片段。

‘Hello, I want to see you.’
“你好，我想见你。”

‘... serious.’
'... 严肃的。'

‘... serious.’
'... 严肃的。'

‘... perfectly agreeable.’
“……非常同意。”

In a minute Dick came into Nicole’s booth, his expression emerging annoyed from behind the towel of his hastily rinsed face.
过了一会儿，迪克走进了妮可的摊位，匆忙洗过脸的毛巾后面露出了恼怒的表情。

‘Your friend has worked himself up into a state. He wants to see us together, so I agreed to have it over with. Come along!’
‘你的朋友已经把自己搞到了一种状态。他想见我们在一起，所以我同意结束这一切。一起来！'

‘But my hair—it’s half cut.’
“但是我的头发——剪了一半。”

‘Nevermind—come along!’
“没关系——来吧！”

Resentfully she had the staring coiffeuse remove the towels.
她愤恨地让瞪着眼睛的理发师把毛巾拿掉。

Feeling messy and unadorned she followed Dick from the hotel. Outside Tommy bent over her hand.
她感到凌乱和朴素，跟着迪克出了酒店。在外面，汤米弯下腰握住她的手。

‘We’ll go to the Café des Alliées,’ said Dick.
“我们要去同盟咖啡馆，”迪克说。

‘Wherever we can be alone,’ Tommy agreed.
“只要我们能单独呆在哪里，”汤米同意道。

Under the arching trees, central in summer, Dick asked: ‘Will you take anything, Nicole?’
在夏季中心的拱形树下，迪克问道：“妮可，你想要什么吗？”

‘A citron pressé.’
“香橼压榨机。”

‘For me a demi,’ said Tommy.
“对我来说是半人半兽，”汤米说。

‘The Blackenwite with siphon,’ said Dick.
“带虹吸管的布莱肯威特，”迪克说。

‘Il n’y a plus de Blackenwite. Nous n’avons que le Johnny Walkair.’
“我不喜欢布莱肯怀特。” Nous n’avons que le Johnny Walkair。’

‘Ca va.’
'静脉。'

“She’s—not—wired for sound
“她——不是——对声音有天赋

but on the quiet
但在安静的时候

you ought to try it—‘
你应该尝试一下——”

‘Your wife does not love you,’ said Tommy suddenly. ‘She loves me.’
“你的妻子不爱你。”汤米突然说道。 '她爱我。'

The two men regarded each other with a curious impotence of expression. There can be little communication between men in that position, for their relation is indirect, and consists of how much each of them has possessed or will possess of the woman in question, so that their emotions pass through her divided self as through a bad telephone connection.
两个人面面相觑，脸上的表情显得奇怪而无力。处于这种位置的男人之间几乎不可能有什么交流，因为他们的关系是间接的，并且包括他们每个人已经或将要占有有关女人的程度，因此他们的情感通过她分裂的自我就像通过一部坏电话一样联系。

‘Wait a minute,’ Dick said. ‘Donnez moi du gin et du siphon.’
“等一下，”迪克说。 “Donnez moi du gin et du siphon。”

‘Bien, Monsieur.’
“好了，先生。”

‘All right, go on, Tommy.’
“好吧，继续吧，汤米。”

‘It’s very plain to me that your marriage to Nicole has run its course. She is through. I’ve waited five years for that to be so.’
“对我来说很明显，你和妮可的婚姻已经走到了尽头。她已经结束了。我已经等了五年了。”

‘What does Nicole say?’
“妮可说什么？”

They both looked at her.
他们都看着她。

‘I’ve gotten very fond of Tommy, Dick.’
“我非常喜欢汤米，迪克。”

He nodded.
他点了点头。

‘You don’t care for me any more,’ she continued. ‘It’s all just habit. Things were never the same after Rosemary.’
“你不再关心我了，”她继续说道。 ‘这一切都只是习惯而已。迷迭香之后，一切都不再一样了。

Unattracted to this angle, Tommy broke in sharply with:
汤米对这个角度不感兴趣，突然插话道：

‘You don’t understand Nicole. You treat her always like a patient because she was once sick.’
“你不了解妮可。你总是像对待病人一样对待她，因为她曾经病过。”

They were suddenly interrupted by an insistent American, of sinister aspect, vending copies of The Herald and of The Times fresh from New York.
他们突然被一个态度阴险的美国人打断，他正在兜售刚从纽约运来的《先驱报》和《泰晤士报》。

‘Got everything here, Buddies,’ he announced. ‘Been here long?’
“伙计们，一切都在这里了，”他宣布道。 “来这里很久了？”

‘Cessez cela! Allez Ouste!’ Tommy cried and then to Dick, ‘Now no woman would stand such—‘
‘塞塞斯·塞拉！ Allez Ouste！”汤米喊道，然后对迪克说，“现在没有女人会忍受这样的——”

‘Buddies,’ interrupted the American again. ‘You think I’m wasting my time—but lots of others don’t.’ He brought a gray clipping from his purse—and Dick recognized it as he saw it. It cartooned millions of Americans pouring from liners with bags of gold. ‘You think I’m not going to get part of that? Well, I am. I’m just over from Nice for the Tour de France.’
“伙计们，”美国人再次打断道。 “你认为我在浪费时间——但很多人不这么认为。”他从钱包里拿出一张灰色的剪报——迪克一看到就认出了它。它描绘了数以百万计的美国人带着一袋袋金子从船上涌出的情景。 ‘你认为我不会参与其中吗？好吧，我。我刚刚从尼斯参加环法自行车赛。

As Tommy got him off with a fierce ‘allez-vous-en,’ Dick identified him as the man who had once hailed him in the Rue de Saints Anges, five years before.
当汤米用激烈的“alez-vous en”把他打发走时，迪克认出他就是五年前曾在圣安格斯街向他打招呼的那个人。

‘When does the Tour de France get here?’ he called after him.
“环法自行车赛什么时候到？”他在身后喊道。

‘Any minute now, Buddy.’
“随时都可以，巴迪。”

He departed at last with a cheery wave and Tommy returned to Dick.
最后他愉快地挥手离开，汤米回到迪克身边。

‘Elle doit avoir plus avec moi qu’avec vous.’
“Elle doit avoir plus avec moi qu’avec vous。”

‘Speak English! What do you mean ‘doit avoir’?’
'说英语！ “doit avoir”是什么意思？

‘‘Doit avoir?’ Would have more happiness with me.’
“和我在一起会更幸福吗？”

‘You’d be new to each other. But Nicole and I have had much happiness together, Tommy.’
‘你们对彼此来说都是新的。但汤米，妮可和我在一起过得很幸福。”

‘L’amour de famille,’ Tommy said, scoffing.
“家庭之爱，”汤米嘲笑道。

‘If you and Nicole married won’t that be ‘l’amour de famille’?’ The increasing commotion made him break off; presently it came to a serpentine head on the promenade and a group, presently a crowd, of people sprung from hidden siestas, lined the curbstone.
“如果你和妮可结婚了，那不就是‘家庭之爱’吗？”越来越多的骚动让他停了下来。不久，它来到了海滨长廊上的一个蜿蜒的尽头，一群人，现在是一群，从隐藏的午睡中涌出来的人，排列在路边石上。

Boys sprinted past on bicycles, automobiles jammed with elaborate betasselled sportsmen slid up the street, high horns tooted to announce the approach of the race, and unsuspected cooks in undershirts appeared at restaurant doors as around a bend a procession came into sight. First was a lone cyclist in a red jersey, toiling intent and confident out of the westering sun, passing to the melody of a high chattering cheer. Then three together in a harlequinade of faded color, legs caked yellow with dust and sweat, faces expressionless, eyes heavy and endlessly tired.
男孩们骑着自行车疾驰而过，汽车里挤满了精心打扮的运动员在街上滑行，高声鸣笛宣布比赛即将到来，穿着汗衫的厨师毫无防备地出现在餐馆门口，在一个拐弯处，一支游行队伍映入眼帘。首先是一位身穿红色运动衫的孤独自行车手，在西斜的阳光下，专注而自信地辛勤劳作，伴随着高亢欢呼的旋律。然后三个人一起穿着褪色的丑角，腿上沾满灰尘和汗水，面无表情，眼神沉重，疲惫不堪。

Tommy faced Dick, saying: ‘I think Nicole wants a divorce—I suppose you’ll make no obstacles?’
汤米面对迪克说：“我想妮可想离婚——我想你不会设置任何障碍吧？”

A troupe of fifty more swarmed after the first bicycle racers, strung out over two hundred yards; a few were smiling and selfconscious, a few obviously exhausted, most of them indifferent and weary. A retinue of small boys passed, a few defiant stragglers, a light truck carried the dupes of accident and defeat. They were back at the table. Nicole wanted Dick to take the initiative, but he seemed content to sit with his face half-shaved matching her hair half-washed.
一支由五十人组成的队伍蜂拥而至，追随第一批自行车选手，排成两百多码。有一些人面带微笑，神情不自然，有一些人明显疲惫不堪，大多数人漠不关心，疲惫不堪。一群小男孩经过，还有几个目中无人的掉队者，一辆轻型卡车载着因事故和失败而受骗的人。他们又回到了餐桌旁。妮可希望迪克采取主动，但他似乎满足于坐在那儿，脸刮了一半，头发洗了一半。

‘Isn’t it true you’re not happy with me any more?’ Nicole continued. ‘Without me you could get to your work again—you could work better if you didn’t worry about me.’
“你对我不再满意是不是真的？”妮可继续说道。 “没有我，你也可以继续工作——如果你不担心我，你就能工作得更好。”

Tommy moved impatiently.
汤米不耐烦地动了动。

‘That is so useless. Nicole and I love each other, that’s all there is to it.’
‘那太没用了。妮可和我彼此相爱，仅此而已。

‘Well, then,’ said the Doctor, ‘since it’s all settled, suppose we go back to the barber shop.’
“那么，”医生说道，“既然一切都解决了，我们就回理发店去吧。”

Tommy wanted a row: ‘There are several points—‘
汤米想吵架：“有几点——”

‘Nicole and I will talk things over,’ said Dick equitably. ‘Don’t worry—I agree in principal, and Nicole and I understand each other. There’s less chance of unpleasantness if we avoid a threecornered discussion.’
“妮可和我会商量一下，”迪克平静地说。 “别担心——我原则上同意，而且妮可和我彼此理解。如果我们避免三边讨论，那么发生不愉快的可能性就会减少。

Unwillingly acknowledging Dick’s logic, Tommy was moved by an irresistible racial tendency to chisel for an advantage.
汤米不情愿地承认迪克的逻辑，但他被一种不可抗拒的种族倾向所感动，想要获得优势。

‘Let it be understood that from this moment,’ he said, ‘I stand in the position of Nicole’s protector until details can be arranged. And I shall hold you strictly accountable for any abuse of the fact that you continue to inhabit the same house.’
“请大家理解，从这一刻起，”他说，“在细节安排好之前，我将站在妮可的保护者的立场上。”对于任何滥用你们继续居住在同一所房子这一事实的行为，我将追究你们的严格责任。

‘I never did go in for making love to dry loins,’ said Dick.
“我从来没有热衷于用干腰做爱，”迪克说。

He nodded, and walked off toward the hotel with Nicole’s whitest eyes following him.
他点点头，朝酒店走去，妮可最白的眼睛跟着他。

‘He was fair enough,’ Tommy conceded. ‘Darling, will we be together to-night?’
“他很公平，”汤米承认。 “亲爱的，今晚我们会在一起吗？”

‘I suppose so.’
'我想是这样。'

So it had happened—and with a minimum of drama; Nicole felt outguessed, realizing that from the episode of the camphor-rub, Dick had anticipated everything. But also she felt happy and excited, and the odd little wish that she could tell Dick all about it faded quickly. But her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd.
事情就这样发生了——而且没有什么戏剧性；妮可觉得自己被猜中了，她意识到从樟脑擦的那一幕开始，迪克就预料到了一切。但她也感到高兴和兴奋，而她能告诉迪克这一切的奇怪的小愿望很快就消失了。但她的目光追随着他的身影，直到它变成一个点，与夏日人群中的其他点融为一体。

十二

The day before Doctor Diver left the Riviera he spent all his time with his children. He was not young any more with a lot of nice thoughts and dreams to have about himself, so he wanted to remember them well. The children had been told that this winter they would be with their aunt in London and that soon they were going to come and see him in America. Fräulein was not to be discharged without his consent.
戴弗医生离开里维埃拉的前一天，他把所有的时间都花在了孩子们身上。他已经不年轻了，对自己有很多美好的想法和梦想，所以他想好好记住它们。孩子们被告知，今年冬天他们将去伦敦和姨妈在一起，很快他们就会去美国看他。未经他的同意，Fräulein 不得被解雇。

He was glad he had given so much to the little girl—about the boy he was more uncertain—always he had been uneasy about what he had to give to the ever-climbing, ever-clinging, breast-searching young. But, when he said good-by to them, he wanted to lift their beautiful heads off their necks and hold them close for hours.
他很高兴自己为这个小女孩付出了这么多——关于那个男孩，他更不确定——他总是对自己必须为这个不断攀登、永远粘着、寻找乳房的年轻人付出什么感到不安。但是，当他向他们道别时，他想把他们美丽的头从脖子上抬起来，紧紧地抱在一起几个小时。

He embraced the old gardener who had made the first garden at Villa Diana six years ago; he kissed the Provençal girl who helped with the children. She had been with them for almost a decade and she fell on her knees and cried until Dick jerked her to her feet and gave her three hundred francs. Nicole was sleeping late, as had been agreed upon—he left a note for her, and one for Baby Warren who was just back from Sardinia and staying at the house. Dick took a big drink from a bottle of brandy three feet high, holding ten quarts, that some one had presented them with.
他拥抱了六年前在戴安娜别墅建造第一个花园的老园丁；他亲吻了帮助照顾孩子的普罗旺斯女孩。她和他们在一起已经快十年了，她跪下来哭，直到迪克猛地把她拉起来，给了她三百法郎。按照约定，妮可睡得很晚——他给她留了一张纸条，还给刚从撒丁岛回来住在家里的巴比·沃伦一张。迪克从某人递给他们的一瓶三英尺高、装有十夸脱的白兰地中喝了一大口。

Then he decided to leave his bags by the station in Cannes and take a last look at Gausse’s Beach.
然后他决定把行李寄存在戛纳车站，最后看一眼高斯海滩。

The beach was peopled with only an advance guard of children when Nicole and her sister arrived that morning. A white sun, chivied of outline by a white sky, boomed over a windless day. Waiters were putting extra ice into the bar; an American photographer from the A. and P. worked with his equipment in a precarious shade and looked up quickly at every footfall descending the stone steps. At the hotel his prospective subjects slept late in darkened rooms upon their recent opiate of dawn.
当妮可和她的妹妹那天早上到达时，海滩上只有一群儿童在前卫。一轮白色的太阳，在白色的天空中勾勒出轮廓，在无风的日子里轰鸣作响。服务员正在往吧台里加入额外的冰块；一位来自 A. 和 P. 的美国摄影师在不稳定的树荫下使用他的设备，并迅速抬头看着从石阶上下来的每一个脚步声。在旅馆里，他的潜在拍摄对象在黑暗的房间里睡得很晚，刚刚度过了黎明的鸦片般的时刻。

When Nicole started out on the beach she saw Dick, not dressed for swimming, sitting on a rock above. She shrank back in the shadow of her dressing-tent. In a minute Baby joined her, saying:
当妮可出发去海滩时，她看到迪克没有穿游泳衣，坐在上面的一块岩石上。她在更衣帐篷的阴影里缩了缩。过了一会儿，宝贝也加入了她，说道：

‘Dick’s still there.’
“迪克还在那儿。”

‘I saw him.’
'我看到了他。'

‘I think he might have the delicacy to go.’
“我认为他可能有美味佳肴。”

‘This is his place—in a way, he discovered it. Old Gausse always says he owes everything to Dick.’
‘这是他的地方——在某种程度上，他发现了它。老高斯总是说他的一切都归功于迪克。

Baby looked calmly at her sister.
Baby平静地看着姐姐。

‘We should have let him confine himself to his bicycle excursions,’ she remarked. ‘When people are taken out of their depths they lose their heads, no matter how charming a bluff they put up.’
“我们应该让他只进行自行车旅行，”她说。 “当人们被拉出深渊时，无论他们虚张声势多么迷人，他们都会失去理智。”

‘Dick was a good husband to me for six years,’ Nicole said. ‘All that time I never suffered a minute’s pain because of him, and he always did his best never to let anything hurt me.’
“六年来迪克一直是我的好丈夫，”妮可说。 “一直以来，我从来没有因为他而遭受过一分钟的痛苦，他总是尽力不让任何事情伤害我。”

Baby’s lower jaw projected slightly as she said:
Baby下颌微微突出，说道：

‘That’s what he was educated for.’
“这就是他受教育的目的。”

The sisters sat in silence; Nicole wondering in a tired way about things; Baby considering whether or not to marry the latest candidate for her hand and money, an authenticated Hapsburg. She was not quite THINKING about it. Her affairs had long shared such a sameness, that, as she dried out, they were more important for their conversational value than for themselves. Her emotions had their truest existence in the telling of them.
姐妹俩默默地坐着。妮可疲倦地思考着；宝贝正在考虑是否要嫁给她的手和钱的最新候选人，一个经过认证的哈布斯堡王朝。她并没有认真思考这个问题。长期以来，她的事务都有着这样的共同点：随着她的干涸，它们的谈话价值比它们本身更重要。她的情感在讲述中得到了最真实的存在。

‘Is he gone?’ Nicole asked after a while. ‘I think his train leaves at noon.’
“他走了吗？”过了一会儿妮可问道。 “我认为他的火车中午出发。”

Baby looked.
宝贝看了看。

‘No. He’s moved up higher on the terrace and he’s talking to some women. Anyhow there are so many people now that he doesn’t HAVE to see us.’
'不。他走到了露台更高的地方，正在和一些女人说话。不管怎样，现在人太多了，他不必见我们了。”

He had seen them though, as they left their pavilion, and he followed them with his eyes until they disappeared again. He sat with Mary Minghetti, drinking anisette.
不过，当他们离开亭子时，他就看到了他们，他的目光追随着他们，直到他们再次消失。他和玛丽·明盖蒂坐在一起，喝着茴香酒。

‘You were like you used to be the night you helped us,’ she was saying, ‘except at the end, when you were horrid about Caroline. Why aren’t you nice like that always? You can be.’
“你就像以前帮助我们的那个晚上一样，”她说，“除了最后，当你对卡罗琳感到害怕的时候。你为什么不总是那么好呢？你可以。'

It seemed fantastic to Dick to be in a position where Mary North could tell him about things.
对于迪克来说，能够让玛丽·诺斯向他讲述事情真是太棒了。

‘Your friends still like you, Dick. But you say awful things to people when you’ve been drinking. I’ve spent most of my time defending you this summer.’
“你的朋友仍然喜欢你，迪克。但是当你喝酒的时候你会对别人说一些难听的话。今年夏天我大部分时间都在为你辩护。”

‘That remark is one of Doctor Eliot’s classics.’
“这句话是艾略特博士的经典之作之一。”

‘It’s true. Nobody cares whether you drink or not—‘ She hesitated, ‘even when Abe drank hardest, he never offended people like you do.’
'这是真的。没有人关心你是否喝酒——”她犹豫了一下，“即使阿部喝得最厉害，他也从来没有像你这样得罪过人。”

‘You’re all so dull,’ he said.
“你们都很迟钝，”他说。

‘But we’re all there is!’ cried Mary. ‘If you don’t like nice people, try the ones who aren’t nice, and see how you like that! All people want is to have a good time and if you make them unhappy you cut yourself off from nourishment.’
“但我们就在这儿了！”玛丽喊道。 ‘如果你不喜欢好人，就试试那些不友善的人，看看你是否喜欢那样！人们想要的只是玩得开心，如果你让他们不开心，你就切断了自己的营养。”

‘Have I been nourished?’ he asked.
“我得到滋养了吗？”他问道。

Mary was having a good time, though she did not know it, as she had sat down with him only out of fear. Again she refused a drink and said: ‘Self-indulgence is back of it. Of course, after Abe you can imagine how I feel about it—since I watched the progress of a good man toward alcoholism—‘
玛丽玩得很开心，尽管她自己并不知道，因为她只是出于恐惧才和他坐在一起。她再次拒绝喝酒，并说道：“这都是自我放纵的结果。”当然，在安倍之后，你可以想象我的感受——因为我看到了一个好人走向酗酒的过程——”

Down the steps tripped Lady Caroline Sibly-Biers with blithe theatricality.
卡罗琳·西布利-比尔斯女士带着轻松的戏剧性绊倒了台阶。

Dick felt fine—he was already well in advance of the day; arrived at where a man should be at the end of a good dinner, yet he showed only a fine, considered, restrained interest in Mary. His eyes, for the moment clear as a child’s, asked her sympathy and stealing over him he felt the old necessity of convincing her that he was the last man in the world and she was the last woman.
迪克感觉很好——他已经提前做好了这一天的准备。吃完一顿丰盛的晚餐后，他已经到达了一个男人应该有的状态，但他对玛丽只表现出了一种微妙的、深思熟虑的、克制的兴趣。他的眼睛此刻像孩子一样清澈，请求她的同情，并偷偷地越过他，他感到有必要让她相信他是世界上最后一个男人，而她是最后一个女人。

... Then he would not have to look at those two other figures, a man and a woman, black and white and metallic against the sky... .
……那么他就不必再看另外两个人影了，一男一女，黑白色，天空映衬下的金属色……。

‘You once liked me, didn’t you?’ he asked.
“你曾经喜欢过我，不是吗？”他问。

‘LIKED you—I LOVED you. Everybody loved you. You could’ve had anybody you wanted for the asking—‘
‘喜欢你——我爱你。每个人都爱你。你可以有任何你想要的人来提出要求——”

‘There has always been something between you and me.’
“你我之间一直有一些东西。”

She bit eagerly. ‘Has there, Dick?’
她急切地咬着。 “有吗，迪克？”

‘Always—I knew your troubles and how brave you were about them.’ But the old interior laughter had begun inside him and he knew he couldn’t keep it up much longer.
“一直以来——我知道你的烦恼，也知道你面对它们是多么勇敢。”但他内心深处又开始了古老的笑声，他知道自己无法再保持下去了。

‘I always thought you knew a lot,’ Mary said enthusiastically. ‘More about me than any one has ever known. Perhaps that’s why I was so afraid of you when we didn’t get along so well.’
“我一直以为你知道很多，”玛丽热情地说。 “关于我的信息比任何人所了解的都多。也许这就是为什么当我们相处得不好时我如此害怕你。

His glance fell soft and kind upon hers, suggesting an emotion underneath; their glances married suddenly, bedded, strained together. Then, as the laughter inside of him became so loud that it seemed as if Mary must hear it, Dick switched off the light and they were back in the Riviera sun.
他的目光温柔而友善地落在她身上，暗示着内心的情感。他们的目光突然结合在一起，紧紧地贴在一起。然后，当他内心的笑声变得如此之大，似乎玛丽一定能听到时，迪克关掉了灯，他们回到了里维埃拉的阳光下。

‘I must go,’ he said. As he stood up he swayed a little; he did not feel well any more—his blood raced slow. He raised his right hand and with a papal cross he blessed the beach from the high terrace. Faces turned upward from several umbrellas.
“我必须走了，”他说。当他站起来时，身体有些摇晃。他不再感觉不舒服——他的血液加速缓慢。他举起右手，在高处的露台上举起教皇的十字架，祝福海滩。几张雨伞上的脸都朝上。

‘I’m going to him.’ Nicole got to her knees.
“我要去见他。”妮可跪了下来。

‘No, you’re not,’ said Tommy, pulling her down firmly. ‘Let well enough alone.’
“不，你不是，”汤米说，用力把她拉下来。 “别管它了。”

十三

Nicole kept in touch with Dick after her new marriage; there were letters on business matters, and about the children. When she said, as she often did, ‘I loved Dick and I’ll never forget him,’ Tommy answered, ‘Of course not—why should you?’
妮可在新婚后仍与迪克保持联系。有一些关于商业事务和孩子们的信件。当她像往常一样说：“我爱迪克，我永远不会忘记他”时，汤米回答道，“当然不会——你为什么要这么做呢？”

Dick opened an office in Buffalo, but evidently without success. Nicole did not find what the trouble was, but she heard a few months later that he was in a little town named Batavia, N.Y., practising general medicine, and later that he was in Lockport, doing the same thing. By accident she heard more about his life there than anywhere: that he bicycled a lot, was much admired by the ladies, and always had a big stack of papers on his desk that were known to be an important treatise on some medical subject, almost in process of completion. He was considered to have fine manners and once made a good speech at a public health meeting on the subject of drugs; but he became entangled with a girl who worked in a grocery store, and he was also involved in a lawsuit about some medical question; so he left Lockport.
迪克在布法罗开设了办事处，但显然没有成功。妮可并没有发现问题所在，但几个月后她听说他在纽约州巴达维亚的一个小镇上从事普通医学工作，后来又听说他在洛克波特也做着同样的事情。偶然间，她比任何地方都更了解他在那里的生活：他经常骑自行车，深受女士们的钦佩，办公桌上总是放着一大堆文件，这些文件被认为是某个医学主题的重要论文，几乎正在完成中。他被认为很有礼貌，曾在公共卫生会议上就毒品问题发表过精彩演讲；但他与一个在杂货店工作的女孩纠缠在一起，并且还卷入了一场关于一些医疗问题的诉讼；所以他离开了洛克波特。

After that he didn’t ask for the children to be sent to America and didn’t answer when Nicole wrote asking him if he needed money. In the last letter she had from him he told her that he was practising in Geneva, New York, and she got the impression that he had settled down with some one to keep house for him. She looked up Geneva in an atlas and found it was in the heart of the Finger Lakes Section and considered a pleasant place. Perhaps, so she liked to think, his career was biding its time, again like Grant’s in Galena; his latest note was post-marked from Hornell, New York, which is some distance from Geneva and a very small town; in any case he is almost certainly in that section of the country, in one town or another.
此后，他没有要求将孩子送到美国，当妮可写信问他是否需要钱时，他也没有回复。在她收到的他的最后一封信中，他告诉她，他正在纽约州日内瓦执业，她的印象是，他已经和某人安顿下来，为他看家。她在地图册上查找了日内瓦，发现它位于手指湖区的中心，被认为是一个宜人的地方。也许，她喜欢这样想，他的事业正在等待时机，就像格兰特在方铅矿中的那样；他最新的便条上盖有纽约州霍内尔的邮戳，那里距离日内瓦有一段距离，是一个很小的小镇；无论如何，他几乎肯定就在这个国家的那个地区，在一个城镇或另一个城镇。
