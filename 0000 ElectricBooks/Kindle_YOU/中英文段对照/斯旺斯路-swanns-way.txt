OVERTURE
序曲

For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say ‘I’m going to sleep.’ And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark indeed.
很长一段时间我习惯早睡。有时，当我熄灭蜡烛时，我的眼睛会很快闭上，以至于我什至来不及说“我要睡觉了。”半小时后，我会想起该睡觉了。我;我会试着把我想象中还在手里的书收起来，然后把灯吹灭。当我睡着的时候，我一直在思考我刚刚读到的东西，但我的思绪已经进入了它们自己的通道，直到我自己似乎实际上已经成为了我书里的主题：一座教堂，四重奏，弗朗索瓦一世和查理五世之间的竞争。这种印象在我醒来后仍会持续一段时间。它没有扰乱我的思想，但它像鳞片一样覆盖在我的眼睛上，使我无法注意到蜡烛不再燃烧的事实。然后它就会开始显得难以理解，就像前世的思想对于转世的灵魂来说必定是一样；我的书的主题将与我分离，让我可以自由选择是否参与其中；与此同时，我的视力会恢复，我会惊讶地发现自己处于一种黑暗的状态，对眼睛来说足够愉快和宁静，甚至更可能对我的思想来说，它似乎无缘无故地难以理解。 ，确实是一件很黑暗的事情。

I would ask myself what o’clock it could be; I could hear the whistling of trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the distance like the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night; and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home.
我会问自己现在几点了；我能听到火车的呼啸声，火车的声音时近时远，像森林里鸟儿的鸣叫一样断断续续，让我看到了荒凉的乡村，一个旅行者正匆匆穿过乡村，奔向最近的车站：他所走过的路，被他在陌生的地方、做不寻常的事情、谈话的最后一句话、在一盏陌生的灯下交换的告别所带来的普遍兴奋所永远固定在他的记忆中，这一切仍然在他的耳边回响。夜的寂静；以及再次回到家的美好前景。

I would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow, as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood. Or I would strike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. The hour when an invalid, who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a strange hotel, awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief a streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door. Oh, joy of joys! it is morning. The servants will be about in a minute: he can ring, and some one will come to look after him. The thought of being made comfortable gives him strength to endure his pain. He is certain he heard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light beneath his door is extinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help.
我会把脸颊轻轻地靠在枕头舒适的脸颊上，就像婴儿时期的脸颊一样丰满、绽放。或者我会划一根火柴看看表。已近午夜。当一个病人被迫踏上旅途并在一家陌生的旅馆里过夜时，他在病痛中醒来，欣喜地看到卧室门下透出一丝日光，这让他如释重负。噢，欢乐中的欢乐！这是早晨。仆人一分钟左右就会过来：他按铃，就会有人来照顾他。舒适的想法给了他忍受痛苦的力量。他确信他听到了脚步声：脚步声越来越近，然后又消失了。门下的光芒熄灭了。现在是午夜;有人已经把煤气关掉了；最后一个仆人已经上床睡觉了，他必须在痛苦中躺一整夜，没有人给他任何帮助。

I would fall asleep, and often I would be awake again for short snatches only, just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or to open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness, to savour, in an instantaneous flash of perception, the sleep which lay heavy upon the furniture, the room, the whole surroundings of which I formed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very soon return to share. Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever outgrown; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors, such as that old terror of my great-uncle’s pulling my curls, which was effectually dispelled on the day—the dawn of a new era to me—on which they were finally cropped from my head. I had forgotten that event during my sleep; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my great-uncle’s fingers; still, as a measure of precaution, I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams.
我会睡着，常常会短暂地再次醒来，只要能听到壁板有规律的嘎吱声，或者睁开眼睛，就能在瞬间的闪光中安定变幻的万花筒般的黑暗，去品味。感知的睡眠，沉重地压在家具、房间和整个周围环境上，我在其中只是微不足道的一部分，而且我很快就会回到无意识状态。或者，也许，当我睡着的时候，我毫不费力地回到了我生命的早期阶段，现在已经永远不再适合我了。我被一种幼稚的恐惧所困扰，比如我的叔祖父拉扯我的卷发，这种恐惧在那天——对我来说是一个新时代的黎明——最终被剪掉了，被有效地驱散了。从我的脑海中。我在睡梦中忘记了那件事；当我成功地让自己醒来以逃离叔公的手指时，我又想起了这件事；尽管如此，为了以防万一，我还是会把整个头埋进枕头里，然后再回到梦的世界。

Sometimes, too, just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam, so a woman would come into existence while I was sleeping, conceived from some strain in the position of my limbs. Formed by the appetite that I was on the point of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that gratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers, would strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company I had left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her kiss, my body bent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes happen, she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking hours, I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have always longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste in reality what has charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory of her would dissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my dream.
有时，就像夏娃是用亚当的一根肋骨创造的一样，一个女人也会在我睡觉时诞生，她是由于我四肢位置的某种紧张而受孕的。我想，正是她给了我这种满足，因为我正处于满足的欲望之中。我的身体意识到自己的温暖正在渗透到她的身体中，会努力与她合而为一，然后我就会醒来。与我刚刚离开公司的这个女人相比，其他人似乎非常遥远：我的脸颊仍然因她的吻而温暖，我的身体在她的重量下弯曲。如果，有时会发生这样的情况，如果她看起来像我在醒着的时候认识的某个女人，我就会完全放弃自己，只为了她的唯一追求，就像人们踏上旅程，亲眼看看某个城市一样。他们一直渴望参观，并想象自己可以在现实中品尝到令他们着迷的东西。然后，渐渐地，关于她的记忆就会消失，直到我忘记了我梦中的少女。

When a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of the hours, the sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly host. Instinctively, when he awakes, he looks to these, and in an instant reads off his own position on the earth’s surface and the amount of time that has elapsed during his slumbers; but this ordered procession is apt to grow confused, and to break its ranks. Suppose that, towards morning, after a night of insomnia, sleep descends upon him while he is reading, in quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to sleep, he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course, and, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the time, but will conclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair, say, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit, the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space, and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country. But for me it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep, and when I awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal’s consciousness; I was more destitute of human qualities than the cave-dweller; but then the memory, not yet of the place in which I was, but of various other places where I had lived, and might now very possibly be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped by myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of civilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps, followed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by degrees the component parts of my ego.
当一个人睡着的时候，他的周围有时间的链条、岁月的顺序、天军的秩序。当他醒来时，他会本能地看着这些，并立即读出自己在地球表面的位置以及睡眠期间经过的时间；但是，这支有序的队伍很容易变得混乱，甚至打乱队伍。假设在一夜失眠之后，到了早晨，他正在阅读时，睡意降临到他身上，而他的姿势与平时睡觉时的姿势完全不同，他只需举起手臂来捕捉太阳并转动它。回到原来的轨道，在醒来的那一刻，他不知道时间，但会得出结论，他刚刚上床睡觉。或者假设他在某种更不正常的姿势下变得昏昏欲睡；比如说，晚饭后坐​​在扶手椅上：然后世界就会从轨道上颠倒过来，魔法椅将带着他全速穿越时空，当他再次睁开眼睛时，他会想象自己去了提前几个月睡在某个遥远的国家。 但对我来说，只要在自己的床上睡得很沉，足以完全放松我的意识，那就足够了；因为那时我对自己睡觉的地方失去了所有的感觉，当我在半夜醒来时，不知道自己在哪里，一开始我无法确定自己是谁；我只有最基本的存在感，可能潜伏在动物意识深处闪烁的感觉；我比穴居人更缺乏人类的品质。但那时的记忆，还不是我曾经住过的地方，而是我曾经住过的、现在很可能是的其他各个地方的记忆，会像一根从天堂垂下来的绳子一样，把我从地狱的深渊里拉出来。不存在，我永远无法独自逃脱：在一瞬间，我将穿越并超越几个世纪的文明，从一连串半可视化的油灯中，然后是翻领衬衫，将把我的自我的组成部分逐渐融合在一起。

Perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon them by our conviction that they are themselves, and not anything else, and by the immobility of our conceptions of them. For it always happened that when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to discover where I was, everything would be moving round me through the darkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy with sleep to move, would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orientation of its various members, so as to induce from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together and to give a name to the house in which it must be living. Its memory, the composite memory of its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades offered it a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept; while the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves to the shape of each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the darkness. And even before my brain, lingering in consideration of when things had happened and of what they had looked like, had collected sufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room, it, my body, would recall from each room in succession what the bed was like, where the doors were, how daylight came in at the windows, whether there was a passage outside, what I had had in my mind when I went to sleep, and had found there when I awoke. The stiffened side underneath my body would, for instance, in trying to fix its position, imagine itself to be lying, face to the wall, in a big bed with a canopy; and at once I would say to myself, ‘Why, I must have gone to sleep after all, and Mamma never came to say good night!’ for I was in the country with my grandfather, who died years ago; and my body, the side upon which I was lying, loyally preserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have forgotten, brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the night-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn and hung by chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Siena marble in my bedroom at Com-bray, in my great-aunt’s house, in those far distant days which, at the moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly denned, but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly awake.
也许我们周围的事物之所以保持静止，是因为我们相信它们就是它们本身，而不是其他任何东西，也因为我们对它们的观念是静止的。因为总是这样，当我像这样醒来时，我的思绪挣扎着试图发现自己在哪里，但没有成功，一切都会在黑暗中在我周围移动：事物、地点、岁月。我的身体，仍然因睡眠太重而无法移动，会努力解释它的疲倦所采取的形式，作为其各个成员的方向，以便从墙壁所在的位置和家具所在的位置进行诱导，拼凑起来并给它必须居住的房子起一个名字。它的记忆，它的肋骨、膝盖和肩胛骨的复合记忆，为它提供了一系列它曾经睡过的房间；而看不见的墙壁不断变化，适应它记忆中的每个连续房间的形状，在黑暗中疯狂旋转。甚至在我的大脑一直在思考事情发生的时间和它们的样子，收集到足够的印象以使其能够识别房间之前，它，我的身体，就会连续回忆起每个房间的床是什么。比如，门在哪里，日光是如何从窗户射进来的，外面是否有通道，我睡觉时脑子里想的是什么，醒来时发现那里有什么。例如，我身体下方僵硬的一侧会在试图固定其位置时，想象自己面朝墙壁躺在一张带天篷的大床上；我立刻会对自己说：‘哎呀，我毕竟已经睡着了，而妈妈却从来没有来道晚安！’因为我和祖父一起住在乡下，祖父几年前就去世了；我的身体，我所躺着的那一侧，忠实地保留着过去的印象，我的头脑永远不会忘记，在我眼前重现了波西米亚玻璃碗中夜灯的微光火焰，形状像一个瓮，用链子挂在天花板上，还有锡耶纳大理石的烟囱，在我康布雷的卧室里，在我姨婆的房子里，在那些遥远的日子里，在醒来的那一刻，它似乎在场，但又不清晰很明显，但当我完全清醒时，一会儿就会变得更明显。

Then would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid away in another direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup’s house in the country; good heavens, it must be ten o’clock, they will have finished dinner! I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always take when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before dressing for the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the Combray days, when, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of pleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from visiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in the sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return from our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a solitary beacon in the night.
然后就会出现一个新位置的记忆；墙壁向另一个方向滑开；我在夫人的房间里。圣卢在乡下的房子；天哪，现在已经十点了，他们吃完晚饭了！当我和夫人散步回来时，我总是在小睡中睡过头。 de Saint-Loup，晚上穿衣服之前。自从贡布雷时代以来，已经过去很多年了，那时，我从最长和最近的散步回来时，仍然能及时看到夕阳的倒影在我卧室窗户的玻璃上闪闪发光。现在，与夫人一起在坦森维尔度过了一种非常不同的生活。德·圣卢，我现在从只在晚上散步，在月光下游览我小时候在阳光下玩耍的道路中获得了另一种乐趣；而卧室，我很快就会在里面睡觉，而不是穿衣服去吃晚饭，当我们散步回来时，我从远处就可以看到它，它的灯从窗户里照进来，就像夜晚中孤独的灯塔。

These shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than a few seconds; it often happened that, in my spell of uncertainty as to where I was, I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that uncertainty was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running, we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon a bioscope. But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in which I had slept during my life, and in the end I would revisit them all in the long course of my waking dream: rooms in winter, where on going to bed I would at once bury my head in a nest, built up out of the most diverse materials, the corner of my pillow, the top of my blankets, a piece of a shawl, the edge of my bed, and a copy of an evening paper, all of which things I would contrive, with the infinite patience of birds building their nests, to cement into one whole; rooms where, in a keen frost, I would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the outer world (like the sea-swallow which builds at the end of a dark tunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth), and where, the fire keeping in all night, I would sleep wrapped up, as it were, in a great cloak of snug and savoury air, shot with the glow of the logs which would break out again in flame: in a sort of alcove without walls, a cave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat whose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature as gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face, from the corners of the room, or from parts near the window or far from the fireplace which had therefore remained cold—or rooms in summer, where I would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening, where the moonlight striking upon the half-opened shutters would throw down to the foot of my bed its enchanted ladder; where I would fall asleep, as it might be in the open air, like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised in the focus of a sunbeam—or sometimes the Louis XVI room, so cheerful that I could never feel really unhappy, even on my first night in it: that room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling would part, ever so gracefully, to indicate where the bed was and to keep it separate; sometimes again that little room with the high ceiling, hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys, and partly walled with mahogany, in which from the first moment my mind was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses, convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though I were not there; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet, which stood across one corner of the room, cleared for itself a site I had not looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of vision: that room in which my mind, forcing itself for hours on end to leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the exact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous funnel, had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched out in bed, my eyes staring upwards, my ears straining, my nostrils sniffing uneasily, and my heart beating; until custom had changed the colour of the curtains, made the clock keep quiet, brought an expression of pity to the cruel, slanting face of the glass, disguised or even completely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses, and distinctly reduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling. Custom! that skilful but unhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end with her provisional arrangements; whom the mind, for all that, is fortunate in discovering, for without the help of custom it would never contrive, by its own efforts, to make any room seem habitable.
这些变化莫测、混乱的记忆从来不会持续超过几秒钟。经常发生这样的情况：在我对自己身在何处的不确定性中，我无法区分构成这种不确定性的连续理论，就像当我们观看一匹马奔跑时，我们无法区分其身体的连续位置出现在生物显微镜上。但我先看到了一个又一个我一生中睡过的房间，最后我会在漫长的醒梦过程中重新审视它们：冬天的房间，我上床睡觉时会在这些房间里度过。立即把我的头埋进一个窝里，这个窝是用最多样化的材料、我的枕头一角、我的毯子顶部、一块披肩、我的床沿和一份晚报建造而成的，我会以鸟儿筑巢般的无限耐心，设法将所有这些事情整合为一个整体；在严寒的房间里，我会感到与外界隔绝的满足感（就像海燕在黑暗隧道的尽头筑巢，并被周围的地球保持温暖），并且在那里，整夜都在燃烧，我会裹着一件舒适而美味的空气睡觉，被木头的光芒射中，而木头的光芒会在火焰中再次爆发：在一个没有墙壁的凹室里，温暖的洞穴从房间的中心挖出来，这是一个热区，当一阵风从房间的角落或部分吹过它们，新鲜地吹到我的脸上时，它的边界不断移动和温度变化靠近窗户或远离壁炉，因为壁炉仍然很冷，或者是夏天的房间，在那里我很高兴感觉自己是温暖夜晚的一部分，月光照在半开的百叶窗上，落在房间的脚下。我的床有施了魔法的梯子；我会在那里睡着，就像在露天一样，就像一只山雀，微风在阳光的焦点上保持平衡——或者有时是路易十六的房间，如此令人愉悦，我永远不会感到真正的不快乐，即使是在我的床上。入住的第一个晚上：那个房间里细长的柱子轻轻地支撑着带有端口的天花板会非常优雅地分开，以指示床的位置并将其分开；有时又是那间天花板很高的小房间，由两层楼挖成金字塔形状，部分墙壁是桃花心木的，从那一刻起，我的心就被花草的陌生气味所迷惑，确信紫罗兰色窗帘的敌意和傲慢冷漠的时钟，它大声地喋喋不休，仿佛我不在那里；一面奇怪而无情的、有平方英尺的镜子横亘在房间的一个角落，为自己清理出了一个我在正常视野的安静环境中没有找到的地方：在那个房间里，我的思想，迫使连续好几个小时，它离开了它的系泊处，向上伸长，以呈现出房间的确切形状，并到达那个可怕的漏斗的顶端，当我的身体伸展开来时，已经度过了许多焦虑的夜晚。躺在床上，我的眼睛向上看，我的耳朵竖起，我的鼻孔不安地嗅着，我的心在狂跳；直到习俗改变了窗帘的颜色，让时钟保持安静，给残酷的斜面玻璃带来怜悯的表情，掩盖甚至完全驱散了开花草的气味，并明显降低了表面上的崇高感。天花板。风俗！那位技巧娴熟但从容不迫的经理，一开始就用她的临时安排连续数周折磨心灵；尽管如此，心灵还是幸运地发现了他，因为如果没有习惯的帮助，它永远无法通过自己的努力使任何房间看起来适合居住。

Certainly I was now well awake; my body had turned about for the last time and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding objects stand still, had set me down under my bedclothes, in my bedroom, and had fixed, approximately in their right places in the uncertain light, my chest of drawers, my writing-table, my fireplace, the window overlooking the street, and both the doors. But it was no good my knowing that I was not in any of those houses of which, in the stupid moment of waking, if I had not caught sight exactly, I could still believe in their possible presence; for memory was now set in motion; as a rule I did not attempt to go to sleep again at once, but used to spend the greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at Combray with my great-aunt, at Balbec, Paris, Doncières, Venice, and the rest; remembering again all the places and people that I had known, what I had actually seen of them, and what others had told me.
当然，我现在已经完全清醒了。我的身体最后一次转动，善良的确定天使让周围的所有物体都静止不动，把我放在我的卧室里的床单下，并在不确定的光线下大约固定在正确的位置，我的抽屉柜、我的写字台、我的壁炉、临街的窗户，还有两扇门。但我知道自己并不在那些房子里，即使在愚蠢的醒来时刻，如果我没有准确地看到它们，我仍然可以相信它们可能存在，这对我来说是没有用的；但我知道自己并不在这些房子里。因为记忆现在开始运转了；通常，我不会立即尝试再次入睡，而是花大部分时间回忆我们过去在贡布雷和姨婆的生活，在巴尔贝克、巴黎、东西埃、威尼斯和巴黎的生活。其余的部分;再次回忆起我所认识的所有地方和人、我实际看到的以及其他人告诉我的事情。

At Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should have to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy idea of giving me, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic lantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders and glass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours, in which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory window. But my sorrows were only increased, because this change of lighting destroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary impression I had formed of my room, thanks to which the room itself, but for the torture of having to go to bed in it, had become quite endurable. For now I no longer recognised it, and I became uneasy, as though I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging, in a place where I had just arrived, by train, for the first time.
在贡布雷，每天下午结束时，早在我必须上床睡觉、躺在那里、远离母亲和祖母的时候，我的卧室就成了我忧郁和焦虑的思绪的固定点。居中。有人想出了一个好主意，送给我一盏神奇的灯笼，在晚上我看起来异常可怜的时候分散我的注意力，当我们等待晚餐时间到来时，它常常被放在我的灯顶上：以哥特时代的建筑大师和玻璃画家，它用一种难以捉摸的彩虹色和多种颜色的超自然现象取代了我墙壁的不透明，其中描绘了传说，就像在移动和短暂的窗户上一样。但我的悲伤只会增加，因为这种灯光的变化破坏了我对我的房间形成的习惯印象，这是其他任何事情都无法做到的，多亏了这个房间本身，如果不是因为不得不在里面睡觉的折磨，已经变得相当能忍了。现在我不再认出它了，我变得不安，仿佛我在某个旅馆或带家具的住宿的房间里，在我第一次乘火车到达的地方。

Riding at a jerky trot, Golo, his mind filled with an infamous design, issued from the little three-cornered forest which dyed dark-green the slope of a convenient hill, and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the castle of poor Geneviève de Brabant. This castle was cut off short by a curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the transparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through a slot in the lantern. It was only the wing of a castle, and in front of it stretched a moor on which Geneviève stood, lost in contemplation, wearing a blue girdle. The castle and the moor were yellow, but I could tell their colour without waiting to see them, for before the slides made their appearance the old-gold sonorous name of Brabant had given me an unmistakable clue. Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read aloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly to understand, for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty, so as to conform to the indications given in the text; then he rode away at the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest his slow progress. If the lantern were moved I could still distinguish Golo’s horse advancing across the window-curtains, swelling out with their curves and diving into their folds. The body of Golo himself, being of the same supernatural substance as his steed’s, overcame all material obstacles—everything that seemed to bar his way—by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself: the door-handle, for instance, over which, adapting itself at once, would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing its nobility or its melancholy, never shewing any sign of trouble at such a transubstantiation.
戈洛急匆匆地小跑，脑子里充满了臭名昭著的设计，从把一座方便的山坡染成深绿色的三角小森林里出来，跳跃式地向可怜的吉纳维耶芙·德·布拉班特的城堡前进。 。这座城堡被一条曲线截短，这条曲线实际上是幻灯片中一个透明椭圆形的圆周，这些椭圆形通过灯笼上的一个槽推入到位。它只是一座城堡的侧翼，前面是一片荒野，吉纳维芙穿着蓝色腰带，站在上面陷入沉思。城堡和荒原都是黄色的，但我不用等看到它们就能分辨出它们的颜色，因为在幻灯片出现之前，布拉班特这个古老的金色名字已经给了我一个明确无误的线索。戈洛停了一会儿，悲伤地听着我姨婆大声朗读的简短讲话，他似乎完全听懂了，因为他以一种温顺而不缺乏威严的态度改变了自己的态度，以符合指示。文中给出；然后他以同样急促的小跑方式骑马离开。没有什么可以阻止他缓慢的进步。如果移动灯笼，我仍然可以辨别出戈洛的马在窗帘上前进，它们的曲线膨胀起来，并潜入它们的褶皱中。戈洛本人的身体与他的战马的身体具有相同的超自然物质，他克服了所有物质障碍——一切似乎阻碍他前进的东西——通过把每一个可能是骷髅的东西都体现在自己身上：门把手，为例如，他的红斗篷或苍白的脸会立即适应它，不可战胜地漂浮在上面，永远不会失去高贵或忧郁，永远不会在这种变体中表现出任何麻烦的迹象。

And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed around me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express the discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things. The door-handle of my room, which was different to me from all the other doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord and without my having to turn it, so unconscious had its manipulation become; lo and behold, it was now an astral body for Golo. And as soon as the dinner-bell rang I would run down to the dining-room, where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef, shed the same light as on every other evening; and I would fall into the arms of my mother, whom the misfortunes of Geneviève de Brabant had made all the dearer to me, just as the crimes of Golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience.
事实上，我在这些明亮的投影中发现了很多魅力，它们似乎直接来自墨洛温王朝的过去，并在我周围投射出如此古老历史的倒影。但是，当我成功地用自己的个性填充了这个房间时，这种神秘和美丽的侵入让我感到不舒服，直到我不再关心这个房间，就像想到我自己一样。习惯的麻醉作用被破坏了，我就会开始思考并感到非常忧郁的事情。我房间的门把手，对我来说与世界上所有其他门把手不同，因为它似乎会自动打开，而无需我转动它，因此它的操纵变得如此无意识；你瞧，它现在是戈洛的星体。晚餐铃声一响，我就会跑到餐厅，那里那盏大吊灯，对戈洛和蓝胡子一无所知，但对我的家人和炖牛肉这道菜很熟悉，照耀着和每一个餐厅一样的灯光。另一个晚上；我会投入母亲的怀抱，热纳维耶夫·德·布拉班特的不幸使我更加珍惜她，就像戈洛的罪行迫使我对自己的良心进行比平常更加严格的审视一样。

But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed talking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my grandmother, who held that ‘It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country,’ and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the very wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book instead of letting me stay out of doors. ‘That is not the way to make him strong and active,’ she would say sadly, ‘especially this little man, who needs all the strength and character that he can get.’ My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an interest in meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him, looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard, not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my grandmother, in all weathers, even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Françoise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs, so that they should not get soaked—you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden, lashed by the storm, pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and rain. She would say, ‘At last one can breathe!’ and would run up and down the soaking paths—too straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve—with her keen, jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity of my education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety (for that was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh despair.
但晚餐后，唉，我很快就不得不把妈妈留在花园里，如果天气好的话，她会和其他人聊天，或者在潮湿的时候每个人都躲在小客厅里。除了我的祖母，她认为“在乡下把自己关在屋子里真是可惜”，并常常在最潮湿的日子里与我的父亲进行无休止的讨论，因为他会带着一本书把我送到我的房间而不是让我待在门外。 “这不是让他变得坚强和活跃的方法，”她悲伤地说，“尤其是这个小男人，他需要他所能获得的所有力量和性格。”我父亲会耸耸肩，研究晴雨表，因为他对气象学很感兴趣，而我的母亲却保持着安静，以免打扰他，用温柔的敬意看着他，但又不太用力，不想窥探他卓越心灵的奥秘。但我的祖母，无论天气如何，即使是倾盆大雨，弗朗索瓦丝也带着珍贵的柳条扶手椅冲进室内，以免它们被淋湿——你会看到我的祖母在荒芜的花园里踱步，被暴风雨袭击。她把花白的头发乱糟糟地向后梳开，让眉毛能更自由地吸收风雨的滋润。她会说：‘终于可以呼吸了！”并且会在湿透的小路上跑来跑去——对她来说太笔直和对称，因为新园丁缺乏对自然的感觉，我父亲整个早上都在问他天气是否会好转——她敏捷而颤抖的小步是由暴风雨的陶醉、卫生的力量、我的教育的愚蠢和花园的对称对她的灵魂造成的各种影响所调节的，而不是由任何焦虑（因为这对她来说是完全不知道的）。她）把她紫红色的裙子从泥点中拯救出来，裙子会逐渐消失到深处，这总是给她的女仆带来新的问题，让她充满新的绝望。

When these walks of my grandmother’s took place after dinner there was one thing which never failed to bring her back to the house: that was if (at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her, moth-like, in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs were set out on the card-table) my great-aunt called out to her: ‘Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!’ For, simply to tease her (she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my father’s family that everyone made a joke of it), my great-aunt used to make my grandfather, who was forbidden liqueurs, take just a few drops. My poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to taste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops all the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the sight of my grandmother’s vain entreaties, of her in her weakness conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur-glass—all these were things of the sort to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at them, to take the tormentor’s side with a. happy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her ‘Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!’ in my cowardice I became at once a man, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and injustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the roof, which smelt of orris-root, and was scented also by a wild currant-bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through the half-opened window. Intended for a more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I could see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time my place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door Ï was allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of desire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate health, and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother’s mind than any little breach of the rules by her husband, during those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening, in which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the heavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn, covered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon them either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an involuntary tear.
当我的祖母在晚饭后散步时，有一件事总能让她回到家：那就是如果（在那些时刻，当她的路线旋转使她像飞蛾一样，看到小客厅里的灯，牌桌上摆着利口酒）我姨婆对她喊道：“巴蒂尔德！”进来吧，阻止你丈夫喝白兰地！”因为，只是为了取笑她（她给我父亲的家庭带来了一种如此陌生的思想，以至于每个人都开玩笑），我的姨婆过去常常让我的祖父，那些被禁止喝利口酒的人，只喝几滴。我可怜的祖母会进来恳求她的丈夫不要尝白兰地；但她的丈夫却没有喝白兰地。他会生气，吞下他的几滴，而她会再次悲伤和沮丧地出去，但仍然微笑，因为她是如此谦卑和甜蜜，以至于她对别人的温柔，以及她对自己和他人的不断服从。她自己的烦恼，都表现在她的脸上，脸上带着微笑，与大多数人的脸上所见的微笑不同，除了她自己，她脸上没有任何讽刺的痕迹，而对我们所有人来说，亲吻似乎从她的眼睛里涌出来，看着她所爱的人，她总是渴望给予他们热情的爱抚。我曾祖母对她的折磨，我祖母徒劳的恳求，她在开始之前就克服了她的弱点，但仍然徒劳地努力让我祖父戒掉他的利口酒杯——所有这些都是我的事情。在以后的岁月里，人们会习惯于对他们微笑，站在施虐者一边。 快乐的决心使人相信这并不是真正的折磨；但在那些日子里，他们让我充满了恐惧，我真想打我的姨婆。然而，当我听到她‘巴蒂尔德！进来吧，阻止你丈夫喝白兰地！’在我的怯懦中，我立刻变成了一个男人，做了我们所有成年男人在面对痛苦和不公正时所做的事情；我宁愿不看见他们；我跑到屋顶上，在教室旁边、屋顶下的一个小房间里独自哭泣，房间里有鸢尾根的味道，还有爬在石头之间的野醋栗树的香味。外墙，将一根开花的树枝从半开的窗户里伸了进来。这个房间是为了更特殊和更卑鄙的用途而设计的，白天从这里我可以看到鲁桑维尔勒潘的要塞，很长一段时间以来，它都是我的避难所，无疑是因为它是我的避难所。每当我的工作需要不可侵犯的孤独时，唯一一个可以锁门的房间；阅读或做梦，秘密的眼泪或欲望的爆发。唉!我几乎不知道，我自己缺乏意志力，我脆弱的健康状况，以及随之而来的对我未来的不确定性，对我祖母来说，比她丈夫在下午和下午无休止的巡视中任何一点违反规则的事情都要严重得多。傍晚时分，我们经常看到她的英俊脸庞斜向天空，她那英俊的脸庞，棕色的、布满皱纹的脸颊，随着年龄的增长，几乎变成了秋天耕田的紫色，如果她走路，她的脸就会被遮住。在国外，半掀着面纱，而在他们身上，要么是寒冷，要么是某种悲伤的倒影，总是留下不由自主的泪水干燥的痕迹。

My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma would come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw, rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared. Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to call her back, to say to her ‘Kiss me just once again,’ but I knew that then she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom of having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was already crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she bent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host, for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of her real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come at all. Our ‘guests’ were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from a few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the house at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently since his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his wife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous, interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out of action by coming in ‘without ringing,’ but the double peal—timid, oval, gilded—of the visitors’ bell, everyone would at once exclaim ‘A visitor! Who in the world can it be?’ but they knew quite well that it could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand through her boy’s hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it stick out properly round his head.
当我晚上上楼时，唯一的安慰是妈妈会在我上床后进来亲吻我。但这个美好的夜晚只持续了这么短的时间：她很快又下去了，以至于我听到她爬楼梯的那一刻，然后听到她穿着蓝色平纹细布花园连衣裙的声音，裙子上挂着稻草编织的小流苏沿着双门走廊沙沙作响，对我来说是最悲伤的时刻。我非常喜欢那个美好的夜晚，以至于我希望它能尽可能晚地到来，以便延长妈妈尚未出现的休息时间。有时，当她吻完我后，打开门要走时，我很想把她叫回来，对她说：“再吻我一次吧”，但我知道，那样的话，她会立刻露出不高兴的表情，因为她的让步。当我带着这个和平之吻来到我身边时，我总是感到痛苦和不安，这总是惹恼了我的父亲，他认为这样的仪式很荒谬，她会想尽一切办法说服我不再需要她在场的习惯。 ，这与我在她已经跨过门槛时向她请求额外的吻的习惯逐渐养成是完全不同的事情。看到她不高兴的样子，破坏了她刚才给我带来的所有平静感，当时她把她慈爱的脸俯在我的床上，像主人一样把它递给我，作为一种圣餐行为，我的嘴唇在其中可能会深深地感受到她真实存在的感觉，并随之而来的睡眠的力量。但妈妈在我房间里短暂停留的那些夜晚，与我们请客吃饭的那些夜晚相比，确实是甜蜜的，因此她根本没有来。我们的‘客人’实际上仅限于M。 斯旺，除了几个路过的陌生人之外，几乎是唯一一个来贡布雷家里的人，有时参加邻里的晚宴（但自从他不幸的婚姻之后，他就很少来了，因为我的家人不愿意接待他的妻子）有时晚饭后，不请自来。那些夜晚，当我们坐在屋前的大栗树下，围着铁桌时，我们听到的声音是从花园的另一端传来的，而不是他走近时那种震耳欲聋的巨响。铁锈色的、没完没了的、冰冷的声音，任何家庭成员只要“不响”地进来就让它停止工作，但是来访者的钟声——胆怯的、椭圆形的、镀金的——的双响声，每个人都会立即惊呼“有访客！到底是谁？”但他们心里很清楚，只能是斯万先生。我的姨婆为了树立榜样，会大声说话，用一种她努力让自己听起来很自然的语气，告诉其他人不要低声说话；对于一个进来的陌生人来说，没有什么比这更令人不愉快的了，他会被引导认为人们正在谈论他不应该听到的事情；然后我的祖母会被派去当侦察兵，她总是很高兴找到借口在花园里多转一圈，当她经过时，她会利用这个借口偷偷地移走一两棵玫瑰树的木桩，以便让玫瑰看起来更自然一点，就像理发师把头发弄平后，母亲可能会用手梳理男孩的头发，让头发在他的头上适当地伸出来。

And there we would all stay, hanging on the words which would fall from my grandmother’s lips when she brought us back her report of the enemy, as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of possible invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: ‘I can hear Swann’s voice.’ And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes, under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the Bressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible, so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going for anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my grandmother made a great point, thinking it ‘nicer of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors only. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my grandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann’s father, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing would, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would hear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose bedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him for a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns’ family property on the outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping profusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park, where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather by the arm and cried, ‘Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be walking here together on such a charming day! Don’t you see how pretty they are, all these trees—my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you have never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don’t you feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it’s good to be alive all the same, my dear Amédée!’ And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind: that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived her, ‘It’s a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I cannot think of her very much at any one time.’ ‘Often, but a little at a time, like poor old Swann,’ became one of my grandfather’s favourite phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have assumed that this father of Swann’s had been a monster if my grandfather, whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, ‘But, after all, he had a heart of gold.’
我们都会呆在那里，牢牢抓住祖母向我们带回有关敌人的报告时从嘴里说出的话，就好像在众多可能的入侵者中存在着某种不确定性，然后，不久之后，我的祖父会说：“我能听到斯旺的声音。”事实上，人们只能通过他的声音来辨别他的身份，因为很难辨认出他的脸，高高的额头下有拱形的鼻子和绿色的眼睛，上面镶着金色的流苏。 ，几乎是红色的头发，穿着布雷桑风格的衣服，因为在花园里我们尽可能少地使用灯光，以免吸引蚊子：我会溜走，好像不去寻找任何特别的东西，告诉他们带出来糖浆；因为我的祖母提出了一个很好的观点，认为“最好不要让他们看起来有任何异常，我们只为访客保留这些”。虽然斯旺先生比我年轻得多，但他对我的祖父却很依恋，在他那个时代，祖父是斯旺父亲的亲密朋友，他是一个优秀但古怪的人，似乎最微小的事情常常会影响到他的父亲。检查他的精神流动并转移他的思想潮流。一年中，我多次听到祖父在餐桌上讲述老斯万先生在妻子去世后的行为，这一故事从来没有改变过，他日夜守在她的床边。我的祖父已经很久没有见到他了，他急忙赶到贡布雷郊外的斯旺家族庄园与他会合，并设法将他流着泪暂时引出了死刑室，这样，他就被救了出来。当尸体被放入棺材时，他不应该在场。他们在公园里转了一两圈，那里有一点阳光。突然M。 斯旺抓住祖父的手臂，哭道：“哦，我亲爱的老朋友，在如此美好的一天，我们能一起漫步在这里，是多么幸运啊！”难道你没看到它们有多漂亮吗，所有这些树——我的山楂树，还有我的新池塘，你从来没有向我祝贺过？你看起来像睡前酒一样闷闷不乐。你没有感受到这微风吗？啊!不管你怎么说，活着总归是好的，亲爱的阿梅黛！”然后，他突然想起了死去的妻子，他可能觉得这件事太复杂了，无法探究在这样一个时刻，他是如何他本来可以让自己被幸福的冲动冲昏头脑，但每当他想到任何令人费解的问题时，他都会采取一种习惯性的姿势：那就是，他用手抚过额头，擦干眼睛，然后擦了擦眼镜。他永远不会因为失去妻子而得到安慰，但在他去世的两年里，他常常对我祖父说，‘现在这是一件有趣的事情;’我经常想起我可怜的妻子，但我在任何时候都无法想太多。”“经常，但一次一点点，就像可怜的老斯旺一样，”成为我祖父最喜欢的短语之一，他会说这句话。适用于各种事物。如果我的祖父是比我更好的法官，他的话就是我的法律，并且经常引导我从长远来看赦免我本应赦免的罪行，我就会认为斯旺的父亲是一个怪物。倾向于谴责，并没有继续惊呼：“但是，他毕竟有一颗金子般的心。”’

For many years, albeit—and especially before his marriage—M. Swann the younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society which his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring—with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know it—one of the smartest members of the Jockey Club, a particular friend of the Comte de Paris and of the Prince of Wales, and one of the men most sought after in the aristocratic world of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.
多年来，尤其是在他结婚之前，M.小斯旺经常来贡布雷看望他们，我的曾祖母和祖父母从来没有想到，他已经完全不再生活在他家人经常光顾的那种社会里，或者说，在斯旺这个名字的隐姓埋名下。把他放在我们中间，他们怀着一个诚实的旅店老板家庭的完全天真，他们中间有一个杰出的拦路强盗，却从未意识到这一点——赛马俱乐部最聪明的成员之一，巴黎伯爵的特别朋友威尔士亲王，圣日耳曼郊区贵族世界中最受追捧的人物之一。

Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a ‘good’ marriage, could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M. Swann, the father, had been a stockbroker; and so ‘young Swann’ found himself immured for life in a caste where one’s fortune, as in a list of taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own associates, the people with whom he was ‘in a position to mix.’ If he knew other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes all the more good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat, had he met them while he was walking with ourselves. Had there been such a thing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself, as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father’s position, his coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a very simple life, and having always had a craze for ‘antiques’ and pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d’Orléans, a neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered. ‘Are you really a connoisseur, now?’ she would say to him; ‘I ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have ‘fakes’ palmed off on you by the dealers,’ for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical faculty, and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most minute details, but even when my grandmother’s sisters were talking to him about art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his admiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure—and he would have a fresh story for us on every occasion—with some one whom we ourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman. These stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann invariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he shewed in telling us of them. ‘It is easy to see that you are a regular ‘character,’ M. Swann!’
当然，我们对斯旺在时尚界所扮演的辉煌角色一无所知，部分原因是他自己的保守和谨慎，但也因为当时的中产阶级人们接受了几乎是印度教的东西。他们认为社会由严格界定的种姓组成，因此每个人出生时都会发现自己被要求进入他父母已经占据的生活地位，除了辉煌的职业生涯或“好”的机会之外，什么也没有。婚姻可以将你从那个地位中解救出来，或者让你进入更高的种姓。父亲斯旺先生曾是一名股票经纪人。因此，“年轻的斯万”发现自己终生被禁锢在一个种姓中，在这个种姓中，一个人的财富，就像在纳税人名单上一样，在这样那样的收入限额之间变化。我们认识他父亲交往过的人，所以我们也认识他自己的朋友，那些他“能够打交道”的人。如果他还认识其他人，那么这些人都是年轻时的熟人，他们是他的老朋友。家人，就像我的亲戚一样，更加友善地闭上了眼睛，而斯万本人在成为孤儿后，仍然最忠实地来看望我们。但我们已经准备好打赌，斯万所认识的我们以外的人，如果他在和我们一起散步时遇到他们，他都不敢向他们脱帽致敬。 如果有这样的决定，对斯万应用一个他自己特有的社会系数，与他父亲地位上的其他股票经纪人的所有其他儿子不同，他的系数会比他们的低得多，因为，导致了一个非常大的社会系数。他过着简单的生活，一直热衷于“古董”和图画，现在他住在一栋老房子里，并堆放着他的收藏品，我祖母很想去参观那栋老房子，但它位于奥尔良码头，我的孩子就在这个街区。姨婆认为被分尸是最丢人的事。 “你现在真的是鉴赏家了吗？”她会对他说。 “我是为你自己着想，因为你很可能会被经销商兜售‘赝品’，”事实上，她并没有赋予他任何批判的能力，而且对他的智力也没有很好的评价。他在谈话中会回避严肃的话题，表现出一种非常迟钝的严谨，不仅是当他给我们提供厨房食谱、深入到最细微的细节时，甚至当我祖母的姐妹们和他谈论艺术时也是如此。当他们要求他发表意见或表达他对某幅画的钦佩时，他会几乎不礼貌地保持沉默，然后通过提供（如果可以的话）有关挂画的画廊的一些事实或其他事实来弥补，或绘制的日期。但一般来说，他会满足于通过告诉我们他最近的冒险故事来逗我们开心——而且他每次都会为我们讲一个新鲜的故事——和我们认识的人，比如贡布雷化学家，或我们的厨师，或我们的车夫。 这些故事确实常常让我的姨婆发笑，但她永远无法判断这是否是因为斯旺总是让自己在冒险中扮演荒谬的部分，或者是因为他在告诉我们这些故事时表现出的机智。 “很容易看出你是一个普通的‘角色’，斯旺先生！”’

As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a trifle ‘common,’ she would always take care to remark to strangers, when Swann was mentioned, that he could easily, if he had wished to, have lived in the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l’Opéra, and that he was the son of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million francs, but that it was a fad of his. A fad which, moreover, she thought was bound to amuse other people so much that in Paris, when M. Swann called on New Year’s Day bringing her a little packet of marrons glacés, she never failed, if there were strangers in the room, to say to him: ‘Well, M. Swann, and do you still live next door to the Bonded Vaults, so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to Lyons?’ and she would peep out of the corner of her eye, over her glasses, at the other visitors.
因为她是我们家里唯一一个可以被形容为“平凡”的人，所以当提到斯万时，她总是小心翼翼地对陌生人说，如果他愿意的话，他可以很容易地住在这个地方。奥斯曼大道或歌剧院大道，他是老斯万先生的儿子，他一定留下了四五百万法郎，但那是他的一时时尚。此外，她认为这种时尚一定会让其他人感到非常高兴，以至于在巴黎，当斯旺先生在元旦那天给她带来一小包栗子糖霜时，如果房间里有陌生人，她永远不会失败，对他说：“好吧，斯旺先生，你还住在保税金库的隔壁吗，这样你去里昂时就不会错过火车？”她会从房间的角落里偷看。她的眼睛透过眼镜，看着其他访客。

But if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann, who, in his capacity as the son of old M. Swann, was ‘fully qualified’ to be received by any of the ‘upper middle class,’ the most respected barristers and solicitors of Paris (though he was perhaps a trifle inclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance), had another almost secret existence of a wholly different kind: that when he left our house in Paris, saying that he must go home to bed, he would no sooner have turned the corner than he would stop, retrace his steps, and be off to some drawing-room on whose like no stockbroker or associate of stockbrokers had ever set eyes—that would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as, to a woman of wider reading, the thought of being herself on terms of intimacy with Aristaeus, of knowing that he would, when he had finished his conversation with her, plunge deep into the realms of Thetis, into an empire veiled from mortal eyes, in which Virgil depicts him as being received with open arms; or—to be content with an image more likely to have occurred to her, for she had seen it painted on the plates we used for biscuits at Combray—as the thought of having had to dinner Ali Baba, who, as soon as he found himself alone and unobserved, would make his way into the cave, resplendent with its unsuspected treasures.
但如果有人向我姨妈建议，这个斯旺，作为老斯旺先生的儿子，“完全有资格”受到任何“中上层阶级”、最受尊敬的出庭律师和事务律师的接待。巴黎的一个人（尽管他可能有点倾向于让这种世袭特权暂时搁置），还有另一种完全不同的几乎秘密的存在：当他离开我们在巴黎的家，说他必须回家睡觉时，他刚转过街角，他就会停下来，原路返回，走向某间客厅，没有哪个股票经纪人或股票经纪人的同事曾见过这样的客厅——在我姨妈看来，这同样非同寻常。一个博览群书的女人，想到在与阿里斯塔乌斯的亲密关系中做自己，知道当他完成与她的谈话后，他会深入到忒提斯的领域，进入一个被凡人的眼睛所掩盖的帝国，在维吉尔描绘他受到张开双臂的欢迎；或者——对她更有可能想到的一个形象感到满意，因为她看到它画在我们在贡布雷用来做饼干的盘子上——就像必须与阿里巴巴共进晚餐的想法一样，阿里巴巴一发现他就这么做了。他会独自一人、无人察觉地进入洞穴，里面充满了令人怀疑的宝藏。

One day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged pardon for being in evening clothes, Françoise, when he had gone, told us that she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining ‘with a princess.’ ‘A pretty sort of princess,’ drawled my aunt; ‘I know them,’ and she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her knitting, serenely ironical.
有一天，他在巴黎吃完晚饭后来看我们，并请求原谅我们穿着晚礼服，弗朗索瓦丝在他走后告诉我们，她从他的马车夫那里得知，他正在“与一位公主共进晚餐”。 “一位漂亮的公主，”姨妈慢吞吞地说。 “我认识他们，”她耸耸肩，眼睛没有从编织中抬起来，语气平静地讽刺着。

Altogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was of the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations, she thought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in summer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden, and that from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some photographs of old masters for me.
总而言之，我姨妈对待他的态度并不怎么客气。既然她认为他应该对我们的邀请感到受宠若惊，她认为如果没有从他的花园里摘下一篮桃子或覆盆子，以及从他的每个人那里摘来的桃子或覆盆子，他在夏天永远不应该来看我们，这是理所应当的。去意大利他应该给我带回一些古代大师的照片。

It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not seeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our house for the first time. If the conversation turned upon the Princes of the House of France, ‘Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and don’t want to, do we?’ my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his pocket; she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother’s sister sang; manipulating this creature, so rare and refined at other times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from, the Swann created in my great-aunt’s mind when, of an evening, in our little garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the gate, she would vitalise, by injecting into it everything she had ever heard about the Swann family, the vague and unrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its wake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as ‘seeing some one we know’ is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We pack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to follow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent envelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no doubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family had left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his daily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during our companionable country life. Our friend’s bodily frame had been so well lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family, that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann—this early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is like the other people I knew at that time, as though one’s life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a marked family likeness, the same (so to speak) tonality—this early Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree, of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.
因此，每当我们想要为我们的大型晚宴提供某种特殊酱汁或菠萝沙拉的食谱时，就寄给他似乎是很自然的事情，而他本人不会被邀请参加，因为似乎没有足够的重要性为可能第一次来我们家的新朋友提供服务。如果谈话转向法国王室的王子们，“先生们，你们和我永远不会知道，我们愿意吗？我们也不想知道，是吗？”我的姨婆会尖刻地对斯旺说，而斯旺曾经说过：也许他的口袋里有一封来自特威克纳姆的信；晚上，当我祖母的姐姐唱歌时，她会让他演奏伴奏并翻唱音乐。操纵这种在其他时间和其他地方如此罕见和精致的生物，就像一个孩子一样粗暴地简单，他会像玩一个廉价玩具一样仔细地玩柜子里的一些古玩。当然，当时在所有俱乐部中都是熟悉人物的斯旺与我姨婆脑海中创造的斯旺有很大不同，当时，一个晚上，在我们贡布雷的小花园里，当两声害羞的钟声从房间里响起之后。她将把她所听说过的关于斯旺家族的一切注入其中，赋予它活力，在阴影的背景下，我的祖母在它的尾迹中开始出现模糊且难以辨认的形状，最后可以通过它来识别。它的声音。但是，即使在我们日常生活中最微不足道的细节中，我们也不能说是一个物质整体，对每个人来说都是相同的，只需要像账簿中的一页或记录一样被翻出来。遗嘱;我们的社会个性是由其他人的思想创造的。 即使是我们描述为“见我们认识的人”的简单行为，在某种程度上也是一种智力过程。我们将所看到的生物的物理轮廓与我们已经形成的关于他的所有想法结合在一起，并且在我们在头脑中构建的他的完整图像中，这些想法无疑占据了主要位置。最后，它们如此完整地填满了他脸颊的曲线，如此精确地遵循了他鼻子的线条，它们如此和谐地融入了他的声音，以至于这些似乎只不过是一个透明的信封，所以每次我们看到他的脸或听到他的声音时，我们所认识和倾听的都是我们自己对他的看法。因此，毫无疑问，他们为了自己的目的而建立的斯旺，在他们的无知中，我的家人遗漏了他在时尚界日常生活的一大堆细节，其他人通过这些细节当他们遇见他时，看到所有的美惠女神都在他的脸上加冕，并停在他拱形鼻子的线条处，就像停在自然边界一样。但他们也设法在一张被驱逐了其特色的脸上，一张像无人居住的房子一样空虚而宽敞的脸上，在其不被重视的眼睛深处植入一种挥之不去的感觉，不确定但并不令人不快，一半是记忆，一半是记忆。 -忘记每周晚餐后一起度过的空闲时间，在牌桌旁或在花园里，在我们友好的乡村生活中。 我们朋友的身体结构与这种感觉以及他家人的各种早期记忆如此吻合，以至于他们自己特殊的斯旺对我的人民来说已经成为一个完整的活生生的生物；因此，即使是现在，当我回顾记忆，从我后来认识的、更亲密的斯旺过渡到这个早期的斯旺——这个我可以在其中看到的早期的斯旺时，我仍然有一种离开一个我认识的人去寻找另一个完全不同的人的感觉。顺便说一句，他不像他的继任者，而更像我当时认识的其他人，就好像一个人的生活是一系列画廊，其中包含任何一个时期的所有肖像。明显的家族相似性，相同的（可以这么说）调性——这辆早期的斯旺充满了闲暇，散发着大栗树、一篮子覆盆子和一根龙蒿小枝的香味。

And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady whom she had known at the Sacré Coeur (and with whom, because of our caste theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:
然而有一天，当我的祖母去请求一位她在圣心教堂认识的女士的帮助时（由于我们的种姓理论，她不愿意与这位女士保持任何程度的亲密关系，尽管著名的布永家族的维尔帕里西斯侯爵夫人，这位女士对她说：

‘I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews, the des Laumes.’
“我想你很了解斯旺先生；他是我侄子德·洛姆一家的好朋友。

My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house, which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the tailor had made, saying to Mamma:
我的祖母从电话中回来，对这所房子赞不绝口，它俯瞰着一些花园，夫人就住在里面。德维尔帕里西斯建议她租一套公寓。还有一个修理裁缝和他的女儿，他们在院子里开了一家小店，她去那家店请他们给她在楼梯上撕破的裙子缝上一针。我的祖母发现这些人非常迷人：她说，这个女孩是一颗宝石，裁缝是一个最杰出的人，是她见过的最优秀的人。因为在她看来，区别是完全独立于社会地位的事情。听到裁缝的回答，她欣喜若狂，对妈妈说：

‘Sévigné would not have said it better!’ and, by way of contrast, of a nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:
“塞维涅说得再好不过了！”相比之下，塞维涅夫人的侄子也这么说。她在家里遇见了德维尔帕里西斯：

‘My dear, he is so common!’
“亲爱的，他太普通了！”

Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in my great-aunt’s estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared that the deference which, on my grandmother’s authority, we owed to Mme. de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed in her duty in becoming aware of Swann’s existence and in allowing members of her family to associate with him. ‘How should she know Swann? A lady who, you always made out, was related to Marshal Mac-Mahon!’ This view of Swann’s social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you might almost say a ‘fast’ woman, whom, to do him justice, he never attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though he came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could establish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle, unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.
现在，关于斯万的那句话的效果不是提高了我姨婆对他的评价，而是降低了夫人的评价。德维尔帕里西斯。看来，根据我祖母的权威，我们对夫人的尊重。德·维尔帕里西斯要求她承担相应的义务，不得做任何会让她不值得我们尊重的事情，而且她没有履行自己的义务，没有意识到斯万的存在，也没有允许她的家人与他交往。 “她怎么会认识斯旺呢？”一位你总是认出的女士，与麦克马洪元帅有亲戚关系！”我家里盛行的这种关于斯万社会风气的观点后来似乎被他与一个最下等阶级的女人的婚姻所证实，你几乎可以说一个“快”的女人，公平地说，他从来没有试图把她介绍给我们，因为他继续独自来找我们，尽管他来得越来越少；但他们认为，假设他在那里找到了她，他们就可以从他们那里建立起他通常在其中活动的、他们不知道的圈子。

But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the Duc de X——, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental share in the private lives of men like Mole, the Due Pasquier, or the Duc de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his ‘proper station,’ was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and store up for their children’s benefit, for my great-aunt had actually ceased to ‘see’ the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a ‘Highness’ and had thereby stepped down—in her eyes—from the respectable position of a lawyer’s son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather’s plan of questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my grandmother’s two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the ‘pinchbeck’ things of life, even when they had an historic value, or, generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday life that their sense of hearing—which had gradually come to understand its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table, became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies’ being able to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves—would leave its receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or because they think the whole world a trifle mad.
但有一次，我的祖父在一份报纸上读到，斯旺先生是 X 公爵举办的周日午餐会上最忠实的参加者之一，他的父亲和叔叔是路易统治时期最杰出的政治家之一。菲利普.现在，我的祖父很想了解所有的小细节，这些细节可能有助于他在精神上分享像莫尔、杜·帕斯奎尔或德布罗意公爵这样的人的私生活。他很高兴发现斯旺与认识他们的人交往。然而，我的姨婆却以一种让斯旺名誉扫地的方式解读了这条新闻。因为任何人如果在自己出生和长大的种姓之外选择自己的同伴，在他的“适当地位”之外，在她眼中注定会受到彻底的侮辱。在她看来，这样的一个人似乎放弃了与有地位的人建立友好关系的所有权利，而谨慎的父母为了孩子的利益而培养和积累了这种友好关系，因为我的姨婆实际上已经不再“看到”这个儿子了。一位我们认识的律师，因为他娶了一位“殿下”，因此在她眼中，他从律师之子的受人尊敬的地位降到了那些冒险家的地位，大多是暴发户或马童，我们为他们读书女王们有时会表现出她们的恩惠。因此，当我祖父下次和我们一起吃饭时，她反对我祖父向他询问这些我们发现与他有友谊的人的计划。另一方面，我祖母的两个姐妹，都是老处女，有着她的高尚品格，但缺乏她的智慧，她们宣称，她们无法想象她们的姐夫能在谈论这些琐事时找到什么乐趣。 她们是胸怀远大抱负的女士，因此，她们对生活中所谓的“平奇贝克”事物没有丝毫兴趣，即使它们具有历史价值，或者一般来说，对任何不直接具有历史价值的事物都没有兴趣。与某些具有审美价值的物体相关联。他们对任何直接或间接直接或间接成为我们日常生活一部分的事物都完全不感兴趣，以至于当餐桌上谈话的语气变得轻浮时，他们的听觉逐渐意识到自己的无用。或者只是平凡，如果两位老太太无法引导它回到自己珍视的话题上，就会使其接受渠道闲置，以至于实际上正在萎缩。因此，如果我的祖父想要引起两姐妹的注意，他就必须使用一些警报信号，就像疯狂的医生在对待心烦意乱的病人时所采用的那样；比如用刀刃在玻璃上敲打几下，同时用尖锐的言语和令人信服的眼神固定它们，这些暴力的方法是上述医生很容易带入正常人日常生活中的，要么是出于职业习惯的力量，要么是因为他们认为整个世界有点疯狂。

Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the Figaro in which to the name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words, ‘from the collection of M. Charles Swann,’ asked: ‘Did you see that Swann is ‘mentioned’ in the Figaro?’
然而，当斯万要和我们一起吃饭的前一天，当他送给他们一箱阿斯蒂的特别礼物时，他们的兴趣就增加了，我的姨婆手里拿着一本《费加罗报》，里面有一本《费加罗报》。当时在柯罗展览中展出的一幅画的名称上添加了“来自查尔斯·斯旺先生的收藏”这样的字样，问道：“你看到《费加罗报》中‘提到’了斯旺吗？”

‘But I have always told you,’ said my grandmother, ‘that he had plenty of taste.’
“但我一直告诉你，”我祖母说，“他很有品味。”

‘You would, of course,’ retorted my great-aunt, ‘say anything just to seem different from us.’ For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother’s views, against which she hoped to force us into solidarity with her own.
“当然，”我的祖母反驳道，“为了显得与我们不同，你会说任何话。”因为，我知道祖母从来不同意她的观点，而且不太确信其他人认为这是她自己的观点。我们总是赞同她的观点，但她却希望我们对我祖母的观点进行全面谴责，她希望迫使我们与她的观点站在一起。

But we sat silent. My grandmother’s sisters having expressed a desire to mention to Swann this reference to him in the Figaro, my great-aunt dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial, which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy them.
但我们静静地坐着。我祖母的姐妹们曾表示希望向斯旺提及《费加罗报》中对他的提及，但我的姨婆劝阻了她们。每当她在别人身上看到自己所缺乏的优点，无论多么微不足道，她都会说服自己，这根本不是优点，而是缺点，并且会怜悯他们，以免不得不嫉妒他们。

‘I don’t think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and I shouldn’t feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.’
“我认为这根本不会令他高兴；我很清楚，我应该讨厌看到我的名字像生命一样大地出现在报纸上，如果有人跟我谈论这件事，我一点也不应该感到受宠若惊。

She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother’s sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.
然而，她并没有给我祖母的姐妹们施加太大的压力，因为她们对粗俗的恐惧，把个人的暗示隐藏在大量巧妙的迂回中，达到了如此高超的艺术水平，以至于常常会被忽视。即使是收件人也没有注意到。至于我的母亲，她唯一的想法就是设法说服我的父亲同意与斯旺交谈，不是谈论他的妻子，而是谈论他的女儿，他崇拜她，人们认为，为了女儿，他最终导致了他的不幸。婚姻。

‘You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very hard for him.’
‘你只需说一句话；问问他她怎么样了。这对他来说一定非常困难。

My father, however, was annoyed: ‘No, no; you have the most absurd ideas. It would be utterly ridiculous.’
然而，我父亲很生气：“不，不；”你有最荒谬的想法。这将是非常荒谬的。

But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann’s arrival gave rise to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family: I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others, and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o’clock, when it was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going to sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it instantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly free to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.
但我们当中唯一一个一想到斯旺到来就会产生一种不祥预感的人就是我自己。那是因为晚上有访客时，或者只有斯万先生在家里时，妈妈就不会来我的房间。那时我没有和家人一起吃晚饭：晚饭后我来到花园，九点钟我道了晚安就上床睡觉了。但在这些晚上，我常常比其他人吃得早，然后才进来坐在餐桌旁直到八点，这时我才知道我必须上楼；然后我就开始吃晚饭了。当我躺在床上、准备睡觉时，妈妈总是把那个脆弱而珍贵的吻留在我的嘴唇上，我必须把它从餐厅带到自己的餐厅，并在我需要的所有时间里保持不受侵犯。脱掉衣服，不要让其甜美的魅力被破坏，不要让其挥发性的本质自行扩散和蒸发；就在那些晚上，当我必须煞费苦心地以适当的形式收到它时，我不得不抢夺它，立即在公开场合抓住它，甚至没有时间或适当的自由来应用于我正在做的事情疯子们在关门时强迫自己将所有其他想法从头脑中排除出去，这样当不确定性的疾病再次席卷他们时，他们就能胜利地面对并克服它，并回忆起那一刻的精确时刻。门关着。

We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.
我们都在花园里，门铃羞涩地敲响了两声。每个人都知道那一定是斯万，但他们却用询问的眼神看着对方，并派我的祖母去侦察。

‘See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,’ my grandfather warned his two sisters-in-law; ‘you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.’
“你要清楚地感谢他送来的酒，”我的祖父警告他的两个嫂子。 “你知道这有多好，而且这是一个大案子。”

‘Now, don’t start whispering!’ said my great-aunt. ‘How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?’
“现在，别开始窃窃私语！”我的姨婆说道。 “你愿意走进一所房子，发现每个人都在自言自语吗？”

‘Ah! There’s M. Swann,’ cried my father. ‘Let’s ask him if he thinks it will be fine to-morrow.’
'啊！ “斯旺先生来了，”我父亲喊道。 “让我们问问他是否认为明天会好。”

My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.
我母亲觉得，她的一句话就能消除我的家人自结婚以来一直让斯旺感受到的所有不愉快。她找了个机会把他拉到一边。但我跟着她：我无法让自己让她离开我够不到的地方，因为我觉得几分钟后我就得把她留在餐厅里，然后上到我的床上，不带任何安慰的想法，因为在平常的晚上，她稍后会过来吻我。

‘Now, M. Swann,’ she said, ‘do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.’
“现在，斯旺先生，”她说，“请告诉我关于你女儿的事；我确信她已经表现出了对美好事物的品味，就像她的爸爸一样。

‘Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,’ said my grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the discovery of their finest lines.
“来吧，和我们大家一起坐在阳台上。”祖父走到他面前说道。我母亲不得不放弃这种追求，但她设法从限制本身中提取出进一步提炼的思想，就像伟大的诗人在韵律的专制迫使他们发现自己最好的诗句时所做的那样。

‘We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,’ she said, or rather whispered to Swann. ‘It is only a mother who can understand. I am sure that hers would agree with me.’
“当我们单独相处的时候，我们可以再谈论她，”她说，或者更确切地说，对斯旺低声说道。 ‘只有母亲才能理解。我相信她会同意我的观点。

And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc d’Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother’s sisters, in whose ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:
于是我们大家围着铁桌坐下。我本不想去想那天晚上我不得不独自在房间里度过的那些痛苦的时光，无法入睡：我试图说服自己，它们并不重要，真的，因为第二天早上我应该忘记它们，而专注于对未来的思考，未来将带我，就像在一座桥上一样，跨越在我脚下张开的可怕深渊。但我的心因这种不祥的预感而紧张，就像我向母亲投来的目光一样膨胀，不允许任何其他印象进入。确实，思想确实进入了它，但前提是它们留下了一切美丽的元素，甚至是古怪的元素，因为这些元素可能会让我分心或迷惑。作为一名外科病人，通过局部麻醉，可以在手术时意识清醒地看着他，但没有任何感觉，我可以对自己重复一些最喜欢的台词，或者看着我的祖父试图与斯旺交谈关于奥德里菲-帕斯奎尔公爵的事，却无法激起一方的任何情感或另一方的兴趣。我的祖父刚开始向斯万询问那位演说家的事，我祖母的一位姐妹就对另一个姐妹说道：

‘Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.’
“想象一下，弗洛拉，我今天遇到了一位年轻的瑞典家庭女教师，她告诉我一些关于斯堪的纳维亚合作社运动的最有趣的事情。我们真的必须让她有一天晚上在这里吃饭。”

‘To be sure!’ said her sister Flora, ‘but I haven’t wasted my time either. I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil’s who knows Maubant quite well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of M. Vinteuil’s, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.’
“当然！”她姐姐弗洛拉说，“但我也没有浪费时间。”我在万特伊先生家遇到了一位如此聪明的老先生，他非常了解莫邦特，莫邦特告诉了他关于他如何扮演角色的每一件小事。这是我听过的最有趣的事情。他是凡特伊先生的邻居，我从来不知道。而且他人很好。”

‘M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,’ cried my aunt Céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long; darting, as she spoke, what she called a ‘significant glance’ at Swann. And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline’s way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to underline her sister’s little epigram, or because she envied Swann his having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.
'M。 “万特伊并不是唯一一个拥有好邻居的人。”我的姨妈塞琳大声喊道，她的声音显得很大，因为她很胆怯，又显得很勉强，因为她已经计划了这么久的简短演讲；她一边说话，一边向斯旺投来了她所谓的“意味深长的一瞥”。我的弗洛拉姨妈意识到，这含蓄的话语是席琳为了阿斯蒂而明白地感谢斯旺的方式，她用一种混合着祝贺和讽刺的眼神看着他，要么只是因为她想强调她姐姐的小警句，要么是因为她嫉妒斯万是受了他的启发，或者仅仅因为她想象他感到尴尬，忍不住拿他开玩笑。

‘I think it would be worth while,’ Flora went on, ‘to have this old gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will talk for hours on end.’
“我想，”弗洛拉继续说道，“请这位老先生共进晚餐是值得的。”当你把他带到莫班特或夫人那里时。马特纳他会连续讲几个小时。

‘That must be delightful,’ sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother’s two sisters with a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to ‘add to taste’ in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Mole or of the Comte de Paris.
“那一定很令人高兴，”我的祖父叹了口气，不幸的是，大自然忘记了他的头脑中对瑞典女士之间的合作运动或莫邦特所采用的方法产生热情的兴趣。 ，就像它忘记赋予我祖母的两个姐妹一粒珍贵的盐一样，人们必须自己“添加味道”，以便从莫尔或巴黎伯爵的私人生活的叙述中提取任何味道。 。

‘I say!’ exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, ‘what I was going to tell you has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now, for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.’
“我说！”斯万对祖父喊道，“我要告诉你的事情比你想象的与你刚才问我的事情有更多的关系，因为在某些方面几乎没有什么变化。今天早上我在圣西门看到一段话，你一定会觉得有趣。这本书收录了他对西班牙的访问；不是最好的杂志之一，事实上比一本杂志好不了多少，但至少它是一本写得非常好的杂志，这与我们这些天早上、中午和晚上都必须阅读的毁灭性新闻完全不同。

‘I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the papers very pleasant indeed!’ my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that she had read the note about his Corot in the Figaro.
“我不同意你的观点：有时候我发现读报纸确实很愉快！”我的弗洛拉姨妈插话道，向斯旺表明她已经在《费加罗报》上读到了关于他的柯罗的便条。

‘Yes,’ aunt Céline went one better. ‘When they write about things or people in whom we are interested.’
“是的，”塞琳姨妈的态度更好了。 “当他们写我们感兴趣的事物或人时。”

‘I don’t deny it,’ answered Swann in some bewilderment. ‘The fault I find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it—oh! I don’t know; shall we say Pascal’s Pensées?’ He articulated the title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. ‘And then, in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,’ he went on, shewing that contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to affect, ‘we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In that way we should arrive at the right proportion between ‘information’ and ‘publicity.’’ But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: ‘We are having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits,’ and then, turning to my grandfather: ‘Well, Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, ‘Never did I find in that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.’’
“我不否认，”斯旺有些困惑地回答。 “我发现我们新闻业的错误在于，它迫使我们每天对一些新鲜的琐事或其他事情感兴趣，而一生中只有三四本书给我们提供了真正重要的东西。假设，每天早上，当我们用发烧的手撕下纸上的包装纸时，就会发生变化，我们会发现里面——哦！我不知道;我们应该说《帕斯卡的思想录》吗？”他以讽刺的口吻表达了这个标题，以免显得迂腐。 “然后，在我们十年翻开一次的镀金和工具书里，”他继续说道，表现出世界上一些人喜欢影响的对这个世界事物的蔑视，“我们应该读到，希腊人已经抵达戛纳，或者莱昂公主举办了一场化装舞会。这样我们就应该在‘信息’和‘宣传’之间达到正确的比例。”但他立即后悔自己允许自己谈论严肃的事情，即使是开玩笑，他讽刺地补充道：“我们正在经历一场最严重的事情。”有趣的谈话；我不明白为什么我们要爬上这些崇高的山峰，”然后转向我的祖父：“好吧，圣西门讲述了莫勒维耶如何大胆地向他的儿子们伸出援手。你还记得他如何评价莫勒维耶，“我在那个粗俗的瓶子里从来没有发现除了坏脾气、粗鲁和愚蠢之外的任何东西。”

‘Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very different!’ said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both. Céline began to laugh.
“无论粗糙与否，我知道瓶子里有一些非常不同的东西！”弗洛拉轻快地说，她觉得自己必须感谢斯旺和她的妹妹，因为阿斯蒂的礼物是送给她们俩的。席琳开始大笑。

Swann was puzzled, but went on: ‘‘I cannot say whether it was his ignorance or a trap,’ writes Saint-Simon; ‘he wished to give his hand to my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.’’
斯旺很困惑，但继续说道：“我不能说这是他的无知还是一个陷阱，”圣西门写道； “他希望把手伸给我的孩子们。我及时发现并阻止了他。”

My grandfather was already in ecstasies over ‘ignorance or a trap,’ but Miss Céline—the name of Saint-Simon, a ‘man of letters,’ having arrested the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing—had grown angry.
我的祖父已经因为“无知或陷阱”而欣喜若狂，但塞琳小姐——圣西门的名字，一位“文人”，阻止了她听觉的完全麻痹——却生气了。

‘What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the point of it? Does he mean that one man isn’t as good as another? What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his children, your Saint-Simon, if he didn’t teach them to shake hands with all honest men. Really and truly, it’s abominable. And you dare to quote it!’
'什么！你很欣赏这一点，是吗？嗯，还真是够聪明的！但这有什么意义呢？他的意思是一个人不如另一个人吗？只要聪明善良，无论是公爵还是马夫，又有什么区别呢？他有一种很好的方式来抚养他的孩子们，你们的圣西门，如果他不教他们与所有诚实的人握手的话。确实，这是可恶的。你还敢引用它！

And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: ‘Just tell me again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these occasions. Oh, yes:
我的祖父彻底沮丧了，他意识到，在这种反对下，试图让斯万给他讲那些他会觉得有趣的故事对他来说是多么徒劳，他对我母亲低声说道：“再告诉我一遍你的那句话吧。”在这些场合，这总是让我感到非常安慰。哦是的：

What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor!
主啊，你让我们憎恶什么美德！

Good, that is, very good.’
很好，就是说非常好。

I never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table I should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time, and that Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to give her in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my room. And so I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began to eat and drink and as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand into this kiss, which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in execution, everything that my own efforts could put into it: would look out very carefully first the exact spot on her cheek where I would imprint it, and would so prepare my thoughts that I might be able, thanks to these mental preliminaries, to consecrate the whole of the minute Mamma would allow me to the sensation of her cheek against my lips, as a painter who can have his subject for short sittings only prepares his palette, and from what he remembers and from rough notes does in advance everything which he possibly can do in the sitter’s absence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my grandfather said with unconscious cruelty: ‘The little man looks tired; he’d better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night.’
我的目光从未离开过我的母亲。我知道，当他们坐在餐桌旁时，我不应该被允许整个晚餐时间都呆在那里，而妈妈，因为害怕惹恼我的父亲，不允许我在公共场合给她一系列的亲吻。本来就在我的房间里。所以我向自己保证，在餐厅里，当他们开始吃喝时，当我感觉到时间临近时，我会预先把我所知道的一切都融入到这个吻中，这个吻的执行过程必然如此短暂和隐秘。自己的努力可以投入其中：首先会非常仔细地观察她脸颊上我要印上它的确切位置，并准备好我的想法，以便我能够通过这些心理准备，将整个分钟奉献出来妈妈会让我感觉到她的脸颊贴在我的嘴唇上，就像一个画家，他可以短暂地坐着画他的主题，只准备他的调色板，然后根据他的记忆和粗略的笔记，提前做好他在绘画中可能做的一切。保姆缺席。但今天晚上，饭铃还没敲响，祖父就无意识地残忍地说：“这个小个子看起来很累；他看起来很疲惫。”他最好上床睡觉了。此外，我们今晚要吃晚饭。”

And my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in observing the letter of a treaty, went on: ‘Yes, run along; to bed with you.’
我的父亲在遵守条约的条文方面不像我的祖母或母亲那么严格，他继续说道：“是的，走吧；快走吧！”和你一起睡觉。

I would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the dinner-bell rang.
我真想当场亲吻妈妈，但就在这时，晚餐铃响了。

‘No, no, leave your mother alone. You’ve said good night quite enough. These exhibitions are absurd. Go on upstairs.’
‘不，不，别管你妈妈了。你已经说了很多晚安了。这些展览都是荒谬的。上楼去吧。

And so I must set forth without viaticum; must climb each step of the staircase ‘against my heart,’ as the saying is, climbing in opposition to my heart’s desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had not, by her kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That hateful staircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out a smell of varnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and fixed the special quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made it perhaps even more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed this olfactory guise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we have gone to sleep with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it only as a little girl whom we attempt, time after time, to pull out of the water, or as a line of Molière which we repeat incessantly to ourselves, it is a great relief to wake up, so that our intelligence can disentangle the idea of toothache from any artificial semblance of heroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the precise converse of this relief which I felt when my anguish at having to go up to my room invaded my consciousness in a manner infinitely more rapid, instantaneous almost, a manner at once insidious and brutal as I breathed in—a far more poisonous thing than any moral penetration—the peculiar smell of the varnish upon that staircase.
所以我必须不带任何旅行费就出发；正如俗话所说，我必须“逆着我的心”爬上楼梯的每一步，违背我内心的愿望，那就是回到我母亲身边，因为她没有用她的吻让我的心陪伴我向前。我总是怀着沮丧的心情爬上那个可恶的楼梯，它散发出一种清漆的气味，这种气味在某种程度上被吸收了，使我每天晚上所感受到的特殊的悲伤变得明确和固定，也许对我来说更加残酷。感性，因为当它呈现出这种嗅觉的伪装时，我的理智无力抵抗它。当我们带着令人发狂的牙痛入睡时，只意识到自己是一个小女孩，一次又一次地试图把她从水里拉出来，或者是我们不断对自己重复的莫里哀的诗句，那就是醒来是一种极大的解脱，这样我们的智慧就可以将牙痛的想法与任何人为的英雄主义或有节奏的节奏分离开来。当我不得不上自己的房间时，我的痛苦以一种更加迅速、几乎是瞬间的方式侵入我的意识，当我吸气时，一种既阴险又残酷的方式，一种更加阴险和残酷的方式侵入我的意识，这正是我所感受到的轻松的反面。比任何道德渗透都有毒的东西——楼梯上清漆的特殊气味。

Once in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to dig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the shroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which had been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the rep curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted the desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not put in writing. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt’s cook who used to be put in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my note. I had a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to my mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable, just as it would be for the door-keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor upon the stage. For things which might or might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, abundant, subtle, and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement, against ‘seething the kid in his mother’s milk,’ or ‘eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow of the thigh.’ This code, if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social complications and refinements of fashion as nothing in Françoise’s surroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could have put into her head; and we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past existence in the ancient history of France, noble and little understood, just as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still testify to their former courtly days, and chemical workers toil among delicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of Theophilus or the Quatre Fils Aymon.
一旦进入我的房间，我就必须堵住每一个漏洞，关上百叶窗，在翻下床单时挖掘自己的坟墓，用睡衣裹住自己。但在把自己埋进铁床里之前，我被激起反抗，并尝试了一个死刑犯的绝望策略，因为在夏天的夜晚，我在四柱窗帘中太热了，所以就放在那里了。我写信给母亲恳求她上楼，原因很重要，但我无法写下来。我担心弗朗索瓦丝，我姨妈的厨师，我在贡布雷时负责管理我，可能会拒绝接受我的笔记。我怀疑，在她眼里，当房间里有陌生人的时候，给我母亲传递信息是完全不可想象的，就像剧院的门卫把一封信递给演员一样舞台上。对于那些可能做或可能不做的事情，她拥有一套专横、丰富、微妙的法典，在那些本身难以察觉或无关紧要的问题上毫不妥协，这使得它类似于那些结合了诸如屠杀婴儿等残酷法令的古代法律。乳房有禁令，有夸张的精致，反对“用母乳煮山羊羔”或“吃大腿窝的筋”。如果人们可以通过她拒绝执行我们的某些指示时突然的固执来判断这一准则，那么这一准则似乎预见到了弗朗索瓦丝所处的环境或她的职业生涯中所没有的社会复杂性和时尚的精致化。村里的仆人可以把它放进她的脑袋里；我们不得不假设她身上潜藏着法国古代历史中的某种过去的存在，高贵而鲜为人知，就像在那些制造业城镇中一样，那里的老宅邸仍然见证着他们以前的宫廷岁月，还有化学工人的辛劳。其中包括《提奥菲勒斯奇迹》或《艾蒙之四》的精美雕刻场景。

In this particular instance, the article of her code which made it highly improbable that—barring an outbreak of fire—Françoise would go down and disturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a person as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family (as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also for the stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have found touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her lips, because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it, and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect of making her decline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one chance of success I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not in the least myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who, on saying good night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her an answer about something she had asked me to find, and that she would certainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her. I think that Françoise disbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs imperceptible by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five minutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents, or tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter. Then she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply: ‘What a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this!’
在这个特殊的例子中，她的守则中的条款规定，除非发生火灾，当斯旺先生在为像我这样不重要的人服务时，弗朗索瓦丝不太可能下去打扰妈妈，这体现了她所表现出的尊重不仅为了家人（对于死者、神职人员或皇室成员），也为了我们大门内的陌生人；我也许会在书中找到一种感人的尊重，但她的嘴唇总是让我感到恼火，因为她说话时的语气庄严而温柔，今晚当神圣的仪式发生时，这种尊重比平时更让我恼火。她参加晚宴的性格可能会导致她拒绝打扰晚宴的仪式。但为了给自己一次成功的机会，我毫不犹豫地撒了谎，告诉她，本来想写信给妈妈的根本不是我自己，而是妈妈，在向我道晚安时，恳求我不要忘记给妈妈写信。她对我要找的某件事的答复，如果不把这张纸条交给她，她肯定会非常生气。我认为弗朗索瓦丝不相信我，因为就像那些感官比我们敏锐得多的原始人一样，她可以通过我们其他人察觉不到的迹象立即察觉到我们可能希望隐瞒的任何事情的真实性或虚假性。她。她研究了信封五分钟，仿佛检查纸张本身和我的笔迹可以启发她了解内容的性质，或者告诉她应该参考代码中的哪一条来解决这个问题。然后她带着一种无奈的神情走了出去，似乎在暗示：“父母生出这样的孩子是多么可怕的事情啊！”

A moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage and that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once, in front of everybody; but that when the finger-bowls were put round he would find a way of slipping it into Mamma’s hand. At once my anxiety subsided; it was now no longer (as it had been a moment ago) until to-morrow that I had lost my mother, for my little line was going—to annoy her, no doubt, and doubly so because this contrivance would make me ridiculous in Swann’s eyes—but was going all the same to admit me, invisibly and by stealth, into the same room as herself, was going to whisper from me into her ear; for that forbidden and unfriendly dining-room, where but a moment ago the ice itself—with burned nuts in it—and the finger-bowls seemed to me to be concealing pleasures that were mischievous and of a mortal sadness because Mamma was tasting of them and I was far away, had opened its doors to me and, like a ripe fruit which bursts through its skin, was going to pour out into my intoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of Mamma’s attention while she was reading what I had written. Now I was no longer separated from her; the barriers were down; an exquisite thread was binding us. Besides, that was not all, for surely Mamma would come.
过了一会儿，她回来说，他们还处于冰阶段，管家不可能当着所有人的面立即送出纸条。但当手指碗放在周围时，他会找到一种方法将它滑入妈妈的手中。我的焦虑立刻消退了。现在不再（像刚才一样）直到明天我就失去了我的母亲，因为我的小台词无疑会惹恼她，而且更是如此，因为这个发明会让我在生活中变得可笑。斯万的眼睛——但仍然要让我隐形地、偷偷地进入她自己的同一个房间，她要在她耳边对我低声说话；那个被禁止的、不友好的餐厅，就在不久前，冰块本身——里面有烧焦的坚果——和手指碗在我看来似乎隐藏着调皮的快乐和致命的悲伤，因为妈妈正在品尝它们我在很远的地方，它已经向我敞开了大门，就像一个成熟的水果破皮而出，当妈妈读我写的东西时，她的注意力所带来的甜蜜将倾注到我陶醉的心中。现在我和她不再分离了；障碍已经消失；一根精致的线把我们绑在了一起。此外，这还不是全部，因为妈妈肯定会来的。

As for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann would have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had guessed its purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due course, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years, and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot follow—to him that anguish came through Love, to which it is in a sense predestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but when, as had befallen me, such an anguish possesses one’s soul before Love has yet entered into one’s life, then it must drift, awaiting Love’s coming, vague and free, without precise attachment, at the disposal of one sentiment to-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety or affection for a comrade. And the joy with which I first bound myself apprentice, when Françoise returned to tell me that my letter would be delivered; Swann, too, had known well that false joy which a friend can give us, or some relative of the woman we love, when on his arrival at the house or theatre where she is to be found, for some ball or party or ‘first-night’ at which he is to meet her, he sees us wandering outside, desperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her. He recognises us, greets us familiarly, and asks what we are doing there. And when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be more simple, takes us in at the door, and promises to send her down to us in five minutes. How much we love him—as at that moment I loved Françoise—the good-natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable, human, almost propitious the inconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in the thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies, perverse and seductive, beguiling away from us, even making laugh at us, the woman whom we love. If we are to judge of them by him, this relative who has accosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries, then the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal. Those inaccessible and torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown pleasures—behold, a breach in the wall, and we are through it. Behold, one of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum, a moment as genuine as the rest, if not actually more important to ourself because our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture it to ourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have created it: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting there below. And very probably the other moments of the party will not be essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so well able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that ‘Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more amusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there.’ Alas! Swann had learned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are powerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even into a ball-room by a man whom she does not love. Too often, the kind friend comes down again alone.
至于我刚刚经历的痛苦，我想如果斯万读了我的信并猜到了它的目的，他一定会大笑起来；然而，相反，正如我后来了解到的那样，类似的痛苦多年来一直是他生活中的祸根，也许没有人能像他自己一样清楚地理解我当时的感受；对他来说，那种痛苦在于知道一个人所崇拜的生物正处于某个享受的地方，而自己不在，也无法追随——对他来说，这种痛苦来自于爱，在某种意义上，它是注定的，必须通过爱来实现。装备和改造；但是，就像发生在我身上的那样，当爱情尚未进入一个人的生活之前，这样一种痛苦就占据了一个人的灵魂，那么它就必须漂流，等待爱情的到来，模糊而自由，没有精确的依恋，今天可以由一种情感支配，另一个明天，孝顺或对同志的感情。当弗朗索瓦丝回来告诉我我的信即将送达时，我第一次把自己当学徒时的喜悦；斯旺也很清楚，当朋友或我们所爱的女人的亲戚到达她所在的房子或剧院时，在参加舞会或聚会或“第一次”时，他可以给我们带来虚假的快乐。 “那天晚上”，他要和她见面，他看到我们在外面徘徊，拼命地等待着与她交流的机会。他认出了我们，亲切地向我们打招呼，并询问我们在那里做什么。当我们编造一个故事，要向他的亲戚或朋友传达一些紧急信息时，他向我们保证没有什么比这更简单的了，他把我们带到门口，并承诺在五分钟内将她送到我们这里。 我们是多么爱他——就像在那一刻我爱弗朗索瓦丝一样——这位善良的中间人，只用一句话就让我们想象中的那一团难以想象的、地狱般的欢乐景象变得可以支持、人性化、几乎吉祥。敌人，邪恶而诱人，欺骗我们，甚至嘲笑我们，我们所爱的女人。如果我们以他这个与我们搭讪的亲戚来评判他们，而且他本人也是那些残酷神秘事件的入门者，那么其他客人就不可能如此邪恶。在那些难以接近和折磨人的时光里，她尝到了未知的快乐——看哪，墙上有一个缺口，而我们正在穿过它。看哪，这是一个系列将弥补其总和的时刻，一个与其他时刻一样真实的时刻，如果不是实际上对我们自己更重要，因为我们的情妇更强烈地成为其中的一部分；我们想象它，我们拥有它，我们干预它，几乎我们已经创造了它：即，他去告诉她我们正在下面等的那一刻。聚会的其他时刻很可能不会有本质上的不同，不会包含任何其他如此精致或如此能让我们受苦的东西，因为这位好心的朋友向我们保证，“当然，她会很高兴下来！”对她来说，和你说话比在上面无聊有趣得多。’唉！斯旺从经验中了解到，当一个女人发现自己被一个她不爱的男人追赶进舞厅时，她会感到恼火，第三方的善意是无法控制的。很多时候，好心的朋友又独自下来。

My mother did not appear, but with no attempt to safeguard my self-respect (which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she had asked me to let her know the result of my search for something or other) made Françoise tell me, in so many words ‘There is no answer’—words I have so often, since then, heard the hall-porters in ‘mansions’ and the flunkeys in gambling-clubs and the like, repeat to some poor girl, who replies in bewilderment: ‘What! he’s said nothing? It’s not possible. You did give him my letter, didn’t you? Very well, I shall wait a little longer.’ And just as she invariably protests that she does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for her, and sits on there, hearing nothing further, except an occasional remark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger whom he will send off suddenly, when he notices the time, to put some customer’s wine on the ice; so, having declined Françoise’s offer to make me some tea or to stay beside me, I let her go off again to the servants’ hall, and lay down and shut my eyes, and tried not to hear the voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden.
我母亲没有出现，但她没有试图保护我的自尊（这取决于她继续编造她要求我让她知道我寻找某物或其他东西的结果），让弗朗索瓦丝告诉我，这么多话“没有答案”——从那时起，我经常听到“豪宅”中的门房和赌场里的走狗等向某个可怜的女孩重复这句话，她困惑地回答道： '什么！他什么也没说？这是不可能的。你确实把我的信给了他，不是吗？很好，我再等一会儿。”正当她总是抗议说她不需要门房为她点的额外煤气时，她就坐在那儿，除了偶尔谈论一下天气之外，什么也没听到。搬运工与一个信使交换了这个信息，当他注意到时间时，他会突然派出一个信使，把一些顾客的酒放在冰上；因此，在拒绝了弗朗索瓦丝为我泡茶或待在我身边的提议后，我让她再次前往仆人大厅，然后躺下并闭上眼睛，尽量不听家人正在喝酒的声音。他们在花园里喝咖啡。

But after a few seconds I realised that, by writing that line to Mamma, by approaching—at the risk of making her angry—so near to her that I felt I could reach out and grasp the moment in which I should see her again, I had cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep until I actually had seen her, and my heart began to beat more and more painfully as I increased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm and to acquiesce in my ill-fortune. Then, suddenly, my anxiety subsided, a feeling of intense happiness coursed through me, as when a strong medicine begins to take effect and one’s pain vanishes: I had formed a resolution to abandon all attempts to go to sleep without seeing Mamma, and had decided to kiss her at all costs, even with the certainty of being in disgrace with her for long afterwards, when she herself came up to bed. The tranquillity which followed my anguish made me extremely alert, no less than my sense of expectation, my thirst for and my fear of danger.
但几秒钟后我意识到，通过把这句话写给妈妈，通过接近——冒着让她生气的风险——离她如此之近，我觉得我可以伸出手来抓住我应该再次见到她的那一刻，我已经切断了自己睡觉的可能性，直到我真正见到她，我的心开始跳动得越来越痛苦，因为我命令自己保持冷静并默许我的不幸，这增加了我的不安。然后，突然间，我的焦虑平息了，一种强烈的幸福感席卷了我，就像一剂强效药物开始发挥作用，一个人的痛苦消失了：我已经下定决心，放弃所有在看不到妈妈的情况下睡觉的尝试，并且决定不惜一切代价吻她，即使当她自己上床睡觉时，她肯定会在很长一段时间内蒙羞。痛苦过后的宁静让我极度警觉，正如我对危险的期待、渴望和恐惧一样。

Noiselessly I opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed; hardly daring to move in case they should hear me from below. Things outside seemed also fixed in mute expectation, so as not to disturb the moonlight which, duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the extension, forwards, of a shadow denser and more concrete than its substance, had made the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer, like a map which, after being folded up, is spread out upon the ground. What had to move—a leaf of the chestnut-tree, for instance—moved. But its minute shuddering, complete, finished to the least detail and with utmost delicacy of gesture, made no discord with the rest of the scene, and yet was not merged in it, remaining clearly outlined. Exposed upon this surface of silence, which absorbed nothing from them, the most distant sounds, those which must have come from gardens at the far end of the town, could be distinguished with such exact ‘finish’ that the impression they gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their ‘pianissimo’ execution, like those movements on muted strings so well performed by the orchestra of the Conservatoire that, although one does not lose a single note, one thinks all the same that they are being played somewhere outside, a long way from the concert hall, so that all the old subscribers, and my grandmother’s sisters too, when Swann had given them his seats, used to strain their ears as if they had caught the distant approach of an army on the march, which had not yet rounded the corner of the Rue de Trévise.
我无声无息地打开窗户，坐在床脚上。几乎不敢动，生怕他们从下面听到我的声音。外面的事物似乎也被固定在无声的期待中，以免打扰月光，月光复制了它们，并通过比其实体更密集、更具体的阴影向前延伸，将其向后投射，使整个景观看起来像是在等待。曾经更薄更长，就像一张地图，折叠起来后铺在地上。必须移动的东西——例如栗树的叶子——移动了。但它那微小的颤抖，是完整的，以最细微的细节和极其精致的姿态完成的，与场景的其他部分没有任何不协调，但又没有融入其中，保留了清晰的轮廓。暴露在这片寂静的表面上，没有吸收任何东西，最遥远的声音，那些一定来自城镇远端花园的声音，可以以如此精确的“完成”来区分，以至于它们给人的印象是来自距离似乎只是由于他们的“极弱”演奏而产生的，就像音乐学院管弦乐队在静音弦乐上演奏得如此出色，尽管人们没有丢失任何一个音符，但人们仍然认为它们是在外面的某个地方演奏的离音乐厅很远，所以所有的老订户，还有我祖母的姐妹们，当斯万给她们让座时，常常竖起耳朵，仿佛听到了行军中远方逼近的军队，还没有绕过特雷维斯街的拐角处。

I was well aware that I had placed myself in a position than which none could be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my parents’ hands; consequences far graver, indeed, than a stranger would have imagined, and such as (he would have thought) could follow only some really shameful fault. But in the system of education which they had given me faults were not classified in the same order as in that of other children, and I had been taught to place at the head of the list (doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which I needed to be more carefully protected) those in which I can now distinguish the common feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to a nervous impulse. But such words as these last had never been uttered in my hearing; no one had yet accounted for my temptations in a way which might have led me to believe that there was some excuse for my giving in to them, or that I was actually incapable of holding out against them. Yet I could easily recognise this class of transgressions by the anguish of mind which preceded, as well as by the rigour of the punishment which followed them; and I knew that what I had just done was in the same category as certain other sins for which I had been severely chastised, though infinitely more serious than they. When I went out to meet my mother as she herself came up to bed, and when she saw that I had remained up so as to say good night to her again in the passage, I should not be allowed to stay in the house a day longer, I should be packed off to school next morning; so much was certain. Very good: had I been obliged, the next moment, to hurl myself out of the window, I should still have preferred such a fate. For what I wanted now was Mamma, and to say good night to her. I had gone too far along the road which led to the realisation of this desire to be able to retrace my steps.
我很清楚，我已经把自己置于这样一个境地：我父母不可能让我承担更严重的后果。事实上，后果比陌生人想象的要严重得多，而且（他会认为）只会发生一些真正可耻的错误。但在他们给我的教育体系中，错误的分类顺序与其他孩子的错误顺序不同，我被教导要把错误放在列表的首位（毫无疑问，因为没有其他类别的错误）我需要更加小心地保护它们）那些我现在可以区分出一个共同特征的东西，即人们通过屈服于神经冲动而屈服于它们。但我从来没有听过最后这些话。还没有人以某种方式解释我的诱惑，使我相信我有某种理由屈服于它们，或者我实际上无法抵抗它们。然而，通过之前的内心痛苦以及随之而来的严厉惩罚，我可以很容易地识别出这类违法行为。我知道我刚才的所作所为与我受到严厉惩罚的某些其他罪属于同一类，尽管比它们严重得多。当我出去迎接母亲时，她自己也上床睡觉了，当她看到我还没睡，在过道里再次向她道晚安时，就不能让我在家里呆一天。再长一点，第二天早上我就该被送去学校了；一切都是确定的。很好：如果我下一刻被迫跳出窗外，我仍然宁愿选择这样的命运。因为我现在想要的是妈妈，并向她道晚安。 我在这条路上走了太远，导致我实现了能够原路返回的愿望。

I could hear my parents’ footsteps as they went with Swann; and, when the rattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone, I crept to the window. Mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster good, and whether M. Swann had had some of the coffee-and-pistachio ice. ‘I thought it rather so-so,’ she was saying; ‘next time we shall have to try another flavour.’
我能听到父母和斯旺一起走的脚步声。当大门的嘎嘎声让我确信他真的走了时，我爬到窗前。妈妈问父亲觉得龙虾好吃吗，斯旺先生是否喝过咖啡和开心果冰块。 “我觉得一般般，”她说。 “下次我们得尝试另一种口味。”

‘I can’t tell you,’ said my great-aunt, ‘what a change I find in Swann. He is quite antiquated!’ She had grown so accustomed to seeing Swann always in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to find him suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him. And the others too were beginning to remark in Swann that abnormal, excessive, scandalous senescence, meet only in a celibate, in one of that class for whom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow must be longer than for other men, since for such a one it is void of promise, and from its dawn the moments steadily accumulate without any subsequent partition among his offspring.
“我无法告诉你，”我的姨婆说，“我在斯旺身上发现了多么大的变化。”他太老了！”她已经习惯了看到斯万总是处于青春期的同一阶段，以至于当她发现他突然比她所认为的他的年龄更年轻时，她感到很震惊。其他人也开始在斯万身上评论说，异常的、过度的、可耻的衰老，只有在独身者身上才会出现，对于这一类人来说，似乎没有明天的伟大日子一定比其他人更长，因为对于这样的人来说，它是没有希望的，从它的黎明开始，这些时刻就不断地积累，而不会在他的后代中出现任何后续的分裂。

‘I fancy he has a lot of trouble with that wretched wife of his, who ‘lives’ with a certain Monsieur de Charlus, as all Combray knows. It’s the talk of the town.’
“我想他和他那个可怜的妻子有很多麻烦，她和某个德·夏吕斯先生‘住在一起’，这是所有贡布雷都知道的。这是镇上的话题。

My mother observed that, in spite of this, he had looked much less unhappy of late. ‘And he doesn’t nearly so often do that trick of his, so like his father, of wiping his eyes and passing his hand across his forehead. I think myself that in his heart of hearts he doesn’t love his wife any more.’
我母亲注意到，尽管如此，他最近看起来不那么不高兴了。 “而且他很少像他父亲那样经常做那种擦眼睛、用手抚摸额头的把戏。我自己认为，在他的内心深处，他不再爱他的妻子了。

‘Why, of course he doesn’t,’ answered my grandfather. ‘He wrote me a letter about it, ages ago, to which I took care to pay no attention, but it left no doubt as to his feelings, let alone his love for his wife. Hullo! you two; you never thanked him for the Asti!’ he went on, turning to his sisters-in-law.
“为什么，他当然不知道，”我祖父回答道。 “多年前，他给我写了一封信，讲述了这件事，我小心翼翼地没有注意，但这毫无疑问地表明了他的感情，更不用说他对妻子的爱了。哈喽！你们俩;你从来没有为阿斯蒂感谢他！”他继续说道，转向他的嫂子。

‘What! we never thanked him? I think, between you and me, that I put it to him quite neatly,’ replied my aunt Flora.
'什么！我们从来没有感谢过他？我想，在你和我之间，我把它交给了他，”我的弗洛拉姨妈回答道。

‘Yes, you managed it very well; I admired you for it,’ said my aunt Céline.
‘是的，你处理得很好；我很钦佩你，”我的姨妈塞琳说道。

‘But you did it very prettily, too.’
“但你也做得非常漂亮。”

‘Yes; I liked my expression about ‘nice neighbours.’’
'是的;我喜欢我关于“好邻居”的表达。

‘What! Do you call that thanking him?’ shouted my grandfather. ‘I heard that all right, but devil take me if I guessed it was meant for Swann. You may be quite sure he never noticed it.’
'什么！你管这叫感谢他吗？”祖父喊道。 “我听到了，好吧，但如果我猜到这是给斯旺的，那我就见鬼了。你可能很确定他从来没有注意到这一点。

‘Come, come; Swann is not a fool. I am positive he appreciated the compliment. You didn’t expect me to tell him the number of bottles, or to guess what he paid for them.’
'来来;斯旺不是傻子。我确信他很欣赏这种赞美。你没想到我会告诉他瓶子的数量，或者猜出他买这些瓶子的价格。”

My father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my father said: ‘Well, shall we go up to bed?’
只剩下我的父亲和母亲独自坐了一会儿。然后我父亲说：“好吧，我们去睡觉吧？”

‘As you wish, dear, though I don’t feel in the least like sleeping. I don’t know why; it can’t be the coffee-ice—it wasn’t strong enough to keep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants’ hall: poor Françoise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me while you go and undress.’
“如你所愿，亲爱的，尽管我一点也不想睡觉。我不知道为什么；不可能是咖啡冰——它的浓度不足以让我保持清醒。但我看到仆人大厅里有灯光：可怜的弗朗索瓦丝一直在等我，所以我会让她帮我解开钩子，而你去脱衣服。

My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the staircase. Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I went quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I could hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety, but with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light coming upwards, from Mamma’s candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw myself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not realising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression of anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used to go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences than this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility, and that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as indicating that, with such a punishment as was in store for me, mere silence, and even anger, were relatively puerile.
我母亲打开从大厅通向楼梯的格子门。不久我听到她上楼来关窗户。我悄悄地走进通道；我的心剧烈地跳动，几乎无法动弹，但至少不再是因为焦虑而跳动，而是因为恐惧和喜悦而跳动。我看到楼梯井里有一道光从妈妈的蜡烛中向上射出。然后我看到了妈妈本人：我扑倒在她身上。一瞬间，她惊讶地看着我，没有意识到会发生什么。然后她的脸上露出了愤怒的表情。她没有对我说一句话；就这一点而言，我常常连续几天没有人与我交谈，因为比这少得多的冒犯。妈妈只要说出一句话，就等于承认与我进一步交往是有可能的，而这对我来说可能会显得更可怕，因为这表明，在我即将受到的惩罚下，仅仅沉默，甚至愤怒，都是相对幼稚的。

A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice; the kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which would have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the dressing-room, where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid the ‘scene’ which he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice half-stifled by her anger: ‘Run away at once. Don’t let your father see you standing there like a crazy jane!’
那时她的一句话就暗示着一种虚假的平静，就像一个人与一个刚刚决定要注意的仆人交谈一样。一个人给了一个被送去入伍的儿子一个吻，如果只是生他几天的气，他就会被拒绝。但她听到我父亲从更衣室走来，他去那里脱衣服，为了避免他看到我时会做出的“场面”，她用一种被她几乎窒息的声音说道。愤怒：‘立刻逃走。别让你父亲看到你像个疯子一样站在那里！

But I begged her again to ‘Come and say good night to me!’ terrified as I saw the light from my father’s candle already creeping up the wall, but also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope that my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must if she continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: ‘Go back to your room. I will come.’
但我再次恳求她“过来跟我说晚​​安！”当我看到父亲蜡烛的光已经爬上墙壁时，我感到害怕，但同时也利用他的做法作为勒索的手段，希望我的女儿能得到她的帮助。母亲不希望他在那儿找到我，如果她继续坚持下去，他就一定会找到我，于是她向我让步，说：“回你的房间去吧。”我会来。'

Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one heard me, ‘I am done for!’
太晚了：我父亲已经追上我们了。尽管没有人听见，我本能地低声说道：“我完蛋了！”

I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters granted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to ‘Principles,’ and because in his sight there were no such things as ‘Rights of Man.’ For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at all, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular walk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening, long before the appointed hour he would snap out: ‘Run along up to bed now; no excuses!’ But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in my grandmother’s sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: ‘Go along with him, then; you said just now that you didn’t feel like sleep, so stay in his room for a little. I don’t need anything.’
然而我不是。我的父亲常常拒绝让我做那些由我的母亲和祖母授予我的更自由的章程中明确允许的事情，因为他不关心“原则”，因为在他看来，没有诸如此类的事情。 “人权。”出于某种完全不相干的原因，或者根本没有任何原因，他会在最后一刻阻止我进行某种特定的散步，这种散步如此定期且如此奉献给我使用，以至于剥夺我的这种散步是一种明显违反信用；或者，就像他今晚所做的那样，早在约定的时间之前，他就会突然说：“现在就跑到床上去吧；快去睡觉吧！”没有借口！”但话又说回来，仅仅因为他缺乏原则（在我祖母的意义上），所以正确地说，他不能被称为无情。他带着恼怒和惊讶的神情看了我一会儿，然后当妈妈不无尴尬地告诉他发生了什么事时，他对她说：“那就跟他走吧；”你刚才说你不想睡觉，就在他房间里呆一会儿吧。我不需要任何东西。

‘But dear,’ my mother answered timidly, ‘whether or not I feel like sleep is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed...’
“但是亲爱的，”我母亲胆怯地回答，“我是否觉得睡觉不是重点；我们不能让孩子习惯……”

‘There’s no question of making him accustomed,’ said my father, with a shrug of the shoulders; ‘you can see quite well that the child is unhappy. After all, we aren’t gaolers. You’ll end by making him ill, and a lot of good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Françoise to make up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I’m off to bed, anyhow; I’m not nervous like you. Good night.’
“让他习惯是毫无疑问的，”我父亲耸了耸肩说道。 ‘你看得很清楚，孩子不高兴。毕竟，我们不是狱卒。你最终会让他生病，这会带来很多好处。他的房间里有两张床；让弗朗索瓦丝给你做一份大份的，然后在他身边度过余下的夜晚。无论如何，我要去睡觉了；我不像你那么紧张。晚安。'

It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my sentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring to move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white nightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere in which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up his head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli which M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase, up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have perished which, I imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long time, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to ‘Go with the child.’ Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have been increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the sobs which I had the strength to control in my father’s presence, and which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again through the silent evening air.
我不可能感谢我的父亲；他所说的我的多愁善感会激怒他。我站在那里，不敢动；他仍然站在我们面前，身材魁梧，身穿白色睡衣，头戴粉色和紫色的印度羊绒围巾，自从他开始患有神经痛以来，他常常把头绑起来，像版画中的亚伯拉罕一样站立斯万先生给我的贝诺佐·戈佐利之后，告诉莎拉她必须与艾萨克分开。距离那天晚上已经过去很多年了。我看着他的烛光逐渐爬上楼梯的墙壁，早已被拆除了。在我自己身上，许多我想象中会永远存在的东西已经消失，新的结构出现了，产生了新的悲伤和新的欢乐，这些在当时是我无法预见的，就像现在旧的一样。难以理解。自从我父亲能够告诉妈妈“和孩子一起去”以来，也已经有很长一段时间了。我再也不可能有这样的时间了。但最近，如果我仔细听的话，我越来越能听到父亲在场时我有能力控制的抽泣声，只有当我发现自己单独和妈妈在一起时，这种声音才会爆发。事实上，它们的回声从未停止过：只是因为我周围的生活变得越来越安静，我才重新听到它们，就像那些修道院的钟声，白天被街道的噪音淹没，以至于人们无法听到它们的声音。假设它们永远停止了，直到它们在寂静的夜晚空气中再次发出声音。

Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this crowning mercy, my father’s conduct towards me was still somewhat arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title less, really, than my mother’s or grandmother’s attitude, for his nature, which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening, a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother: ‘Go and comfort him.’ Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to her: ‘But, Madame, what is little Master crying for?’ she replied: ‘Why, Françoise, he doesn’t know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed for me quickly and then go off to your own.’ And thus for the first time my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no small degree of pride, either, in Franchise’s presence at this return to humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep, raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to have been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first time she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era, must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I should have said to Mamma: ‘No, I don’t want you; you mustn’t sleep here.’ But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my grandmother’s nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to disturb my father again. Certainly my mother’s beautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me that this should not have happened; her anger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as she saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: ‘Why, my little buttercup, my little canary-boy, he’s going to make Mamma as silly as himself if this goes on. Look, since you can’t sleep, and Mamma can’t either, we mustn’t go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I’ll get one of your books.’ But I had none there. ‘Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday? Just think it over first, and don’t be disappointed if there is nothing new for you then.’
那天晚上，妈妈在我的房间里度过了：当我犯下了如此致命的罪孽，等待着被逐出家庭时，我的父母给了我一个比我本应赢得的更大的让步，作为对良好行为的奖励。即使在这种至高无上的仁慈体现出来的那一刻，我父亲对我的行为仍然有些武断，不管我的功劳如何，这是他的特点，因为他的行为通常是出于偶然的权宜之计，而不是出于偶然。基于任何正式计划。也许，当他送我上床睡觉时，我所说的他的严厉，实际上也比我母亲或祖母的态度更不值得称谓，因为他的本性在某些方面比他们与我的本性不同，可能阻止了我的行为。直到那时，他才猜到我每天晚上有多可怜，这一点我的母亲和祖母都很清楚。但他们太爱我了，不肯放过我那些痛苦，他们希望教我克服这些痛苦，从而减少我的紧张感，增强我的意志。至于父亲，他对我的感情却是另一种，我怀疑他是否会表现出这么大的勇气，因为当他得知我不高兴的时候，他就对我母亲说：“你去安慰他吧。”妈妈在我的房间里待了整整一夜，似乎她不想因为相互指责而破坏那些时光，因为这与我有权期待的一切如此不同；因为当弗朗索瓦丝（当她看到妈妈坐在我身边，握着我的手，任由我哭泣时，她猜一定发生了一些不寻常的事情）对她说：“但是，夫人，小主人为什么哭呢？”她回答道： “为什么，弗朗索瓦丝，他不了解自己：这是他的神经。 赶紧为我铺好大床，然后去你自己的床上。”就这样，我的不幸第一次不再被视为一种必须受到惩罚的过错，而是一种非自愿的罪恶，已被官方承认为一种罪恶。我的神经状况与我无关：我得到了安慰，因为我不再需要将忧虑的顾虑与我的眼泪的苦涩混在一起；从此我可以无罪地哭泣。弗兰奇斯在场，在这种人道条件的回归中，我也感到了不小的自豪感，就在妈妈拒绝到我的房间并发出冷落的信息让我去睡觉后不到一个小时，弗兰奇斯把我养大了。一个成年人的尊严，突然让我进入一种青春期的悲伤，从眼泪中解放出来。那时我应该感到高兴；我不是。我突然意识到，我的母亲刚刚做出了第一个让步，这对她来说一定是痛苦的，这是她为我所建立的理想的第一步，也是她第一次用她所有的勇气，承认自己被殴打。我突然意识到，如果说我刚刚取得了胜利，那一定是战胜了她；我已经成功地放松了她的意志，改变了她的判断，就像疾病、悲伤或衰老所可能成功的那样。今晚开启了一个新纪元，一定会在日历上留下一个黑色的日期。如果我现在有勇气的话，我就会对妈妈说：‘不，我不需要你；我要你了。你不能睡在这里。”但我意识到她的实用智慧，即现在所谓的现实主义，她用它来调和我祖母天性中热切的理想主义，我知道现在恶作剧已经完成，她更愿意让我享受她陪伴带来的舒缓的快乐，不要再打扰我的父亲。 当然，那天晚上，当我母亲温柔地握着我的手，试图阻止我的泪水时，她美丽的容貌似乎再次焕发出青春的光芒。但正因为如此，我觉得这种事不应该发生。她的愤怒比我童年时所不知道的这种新的仁慈更容易忍受。我觉得我用一只不虔诚而秘密的手指在她的灵魂上划出了第一条皱纹，让她的头上露出了第一根白发。这个念头让我的抽泣更加厉害，然后我发现，从来没有对我表现出任何温柔的妈妈，突然被我的泪水淹没，不得不努力忍住自己的泪水。然后，当她看到我注意到这一点时，她微笑着对我说：“为什么，我的小毛茛，我的金丝雀小男孩，如果再这样下去，他会让妈妈像他自己一样愚蠢。”你看，既然你睡不着，妈妈也睡不着，我们就不能再这样傻下去了；我们必须做点什么；我要买一本你的书。’但我那里没有。 “既然你的祖母要送给你生日礼物，你需要我把书拿出来吗？”先想一想，如果没有什么新的东西对你来说也不要失望。’

I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped, any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the paint-box of last New Year’s Day and the silkworms of the year before. It contained La Mare au Diable, François le Champi, La Petite Fadette, and Les Maîtres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had at first chosen Mussel’s poems, a volume of Rousseau, and Indiana; for while she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she did not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very soul of a child an influence at once more dangerous and less quickening than those of fresh air and country breezes upon his body. But when my father had seemed almost to regard her as insane on learning the names of the books she proposed to give me, she had journeyed back by herself to Jouy-le-Vicomte to the bookseller’s, so that there should be no fear of my not having my present in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come home so unwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again to tire herself in that way), and had there fallen back upon the four pastoral novels of George Sand.
我太高兴了，妈妈去找了一包书，透过包裹的纸，我无法区分它的方形和大小，但即使是第一眼看到，它也很简短和简洁。尽管它很不起眼，但它已经让去年元旦的颜料盒和前一年的蚕黯然失色了。其中包括《La Mare au Diable》、《François le Champi》、《La Petite Fadette》和《Les Maîtres Sonneurs》。后来我才知道，我的祖母最初选择了穆塞尔的诗、一本卢梭的诗集和《印第安纳》。因为虽然她认为轻松的阅读就像糖果和蛋糕一样不健康，但她没有想到，天才的强烈气息对孩子的灵魂所产生的影响，比新鲜空气和乡村微风对孩子的影响更危险，但更不那么迅速。他的身体。但当我父亲得知她打算送给我的书名后，几乎认为她疯了，她就独自回到了茹伊子爵的书店，这样我就不用担心我的书了。没有及时收到我的礼物（那天天气炎热，她回家后身体很不舒服，医生警告我母亲不要再让她以这种方式疲惫不堪），然后又回到了四田园乔治·桑的小说。

‘My dear,’ she had said to Mamma, ‘I could not allow myself to give the child anything that was not well written.’
“亲爱的，”她对妈妈说，“我不能让自己给孩子任何写得不好的东西。”

The truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything from which no intellectual profit was to be derived, and, above all, that profit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our pleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth. Even when she had to make some one a present of the kind called ‘useful,’ when she had to give an armchair or some table-silver or a walking-stick, she would choose ‘antiques,’ as though their long desuetude had effaced from them any semblance of utility and fitted them rather to instruct us in the lives of the men of other days than to serve the common requirements of our own. She would have liked me to have in my room photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places. But at the moment of buying them, and for all that the subject of the picture had an aesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity and utility had too prominent a part in them, through the mechanical nature of their reproduction by photography. She attempted by a subterfuge, if not to eliminate altogether their commercial banality, at least to minimise it, to substitute for the bulk of it what was art still, to introduce, as it might be, several ‘thicknesses’ of art; instead of photographs of Chartres Cathedral, of the Fountains of Saint-Cloud, or of Vesuvius she would inquire of Swann whether some great painter had not made pictures of them, and preferred to give me photographs of ‘Chartres Cathedral’ after Corot, of the ‘Fountains of Saint-Cloud’ after Hubert Robert, and of ‘Vesuvius’ after Turner, which were a stage higher in the scale of art. But although the photographer had been prevented from reproducing directly the masterpieces or the beauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a great artist, he resumed his odious position when it came to reproducing the artist’s interpretation. Accordingly, having to reckon again with vulgarity, my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of contact still further. She would ask Swann if the picture had not been engraved, preferring, when possible, old engravings with some interest of association apart from themselves, such, for example, as shew us a masterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to-day, as Morghen’s print of the ‘Cenacolo’ of Leonardo before it was spoiled by restoration. It must be admitted that the results of this method of interpreting the art of making presents were not always happy. The idea which I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to have the lagoon in the background, was certainly far less accurate than what I have since derived from ordinary photographs. We could no longer keep count in the family (when my great-aunt tried to frame an indictment of my grandmother) of all the armchairs she had presented to married couples, young and old, which on a first attempt to sit down upon them had at once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient. But my grandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too closely with the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still be discerned a flourish, a smile, a brave conceit of the past. And even what in such pieces supplied a material need, since it did so in a manner to which we are no longer accustomed, was as charming to her as one of those old forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a metaphor whose fine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our modern tongue. In precisely the same way the pastoral novels of George Sand, which she was giving me for my birthday, were regular lumber-rooms of antique furniture, full of expressions that have fallen out of use and returned as imagery, such as one finds now only in country dialects. And my grandmother had bought them in preference to other books, just as she would have preferred to take a house that had a gothic dovecot, or some other such piece of antiquity as would have a pleasant effect on the mind, filling it with a nostalgic longing for impossible journeys through the realms of time.
事实是，她永远不会下定决心购买任何不能从中获得智力利润的东西，最重要的是，好东西通过教导我们在贫瘠的满足之外寻找快乐来赋予我们利润。的世俗财富。即使当她不得不送某人一份所谓“有用”的礼物时，当她不得不送一把扶手椅或一些桌银或一根手杖时，她也会选择“古董”，就好像它们的长期废弃已经被抹去了一样。从它们身上可以看出任何实用性，并且它们更适合指导我们了解其他时代人们的生活，而不是满足我们自己的共同需求。她希望我在房间里放一些古建筑或美丽地方的照片。但在购买它们的那一刻，尽管图片的主题有其自身的审美价值，但她会发现，由于摄影复制它们的机械性质，粗俗和实用在它们中占据了太突出的地位。她试图通过一种诡计，即使不能完全消除它们的商业平庸，至少将其最小化，用艺术的大部分来替代它，引入艺术的几种“厚度”；她不会向斯万询问沙特尔大教堂、圣克劳喷泉或维苏威火山的照片，而是询问斯旺是否有某个伟大的画家为它们画过照片，并且更愿意给我柯罗之后的“沙特尔大教堂”的照片，休伯特·罗伯特之后的“圣克劳德喷泉”和特纳之后的“维苏威火山”，在艺术规模上更上一层楼。 但是，尽管摄影师被禁止直接再现杰作或自然之美，并且被一位伟大的艺术家取代，但在再现艺术家的解释时，他又恢复了令人厌恶的地位。因此，不得不再次考虑粗俗，我的祖母会尽力进一步推迟接触的时间。她会问斯旺，这幅画是否没有被雕刻过，如果可能的话，她更喜欢古老的雕刻，除了它们本身之外还有一些关联的兴趣，例如，向我们展示一幅杰作，在这种状态下我们再也看不到它了。 - 天，作为摩根的列奥纳多的“Cenacolo”版画，在被修复损坏之前。必须承认，这种解释礼物制作艺术的方法的结果并不总是令人满意。我从提香的一幅以泻湖为背景的画中形成的威尼斯概念，肯定远不如我从普通照片中得出的概念准确。我们已经无法在家里（当我的姨婆试图对我的祖母提出起诉时）统计她送给已婚夫妇（无论年轻还是年老）的所有扶手椅，这些扶手椅在第一次尝试坐在他们身上时就被拒绝了。立刻就在接受者的重压下崩溃了。但我的祖母会认为，过于关注任何一件家具的坚固性是肮脏的，因为其中仍然可以看出过去的华丽、微笑和勇敢的自负。 即使在这些作品中提供了物质需要，因为它以我们不再习惯的方式提供，对她来说也像那些古老的言语形式一样迷人，在这些古老的言语形式中我们仍然可以看到隐喻的痕迹，我们现代舌头的粗暴使用已经磨掉了细尖。同样地，她送给我的生日礼物乔治·桑的田园小说也是普通的古董家具储藏室，充满了不再使用的表达方式，并以意象的形式回归，就像人们现在才发现的那样。在乡村方言中。我的祖母优先购买它们而不是其他书籍，就像她更喜欢买一座有哥特式鸽舍的房子，或者其他一些能给心灵带来愉快影响的古董，让心灵充满怀旧的感觉。渴望穿越时空的不可能的旅程。

Mamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen François le Champi, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality in my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real novels. I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist. That prepared me in advance to imagine that François le Champi contained something inexpressibly delicious. The course of the narrative, where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain modes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with a little experience, he may recognise as ‘common form’ in novels, seemed to me then distinctive—for to me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects, but was like an individual man, unmatched, and with no cause of existence beyond himself—an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of François le Champi. Beneath the everyday incidents, the commonplace thoughts and hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an intonation, a rhythmic utterance fine and strange. The ‘action’ began: to me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days, when I read to myself, I used often, while I turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd changes which take place in the relations between the miller’s wife and the boy, changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery, the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that strange and pleasant-sounding name of Champi, which draped the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour, purpurate and charming. If my mother was not a faithful reader, she was, none the less, admirable when reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice. It was the same in her daily life, when it was not works of art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was touching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice, her gestures, from her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might have distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the recollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the burden of his years, now the household topic which might have bored some young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the prose of George Sand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral distinction which Mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above all other qualities in life, and which I was not to teach her until much later to refrain from placing, in the same way, above all other qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from her voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural tenderness, all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed to have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to speak, within her compass. She came to them with the tone that they required, with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which dictated them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and by these means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there might be or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and the preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the melancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing to an end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now slackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their difference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this quite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling.
妈妈在我的床边坐下；她选择了《François le Champi》，这本书的淡红色封面和难以理解的标题在我眼中赋予了它鲜明的个性和神秘的吸引力。那时我还没有读过任何真正的小说。我听说乔治·桑是一位典型的小说家。这让我提前想象弗朗索瓦·勒尚皮含有某种难以形容的美味。在我看来，叙述的过程往往会引起好奇或同情，某些表达方式会令读者感到不安或悲伤，只要有一点经验，他可能会认为这是小说中的“常见形式”那么独特——对我来说，一本新书不是众多类似物体中的一个，而是像一个单独的人，无与伦比，除了他自己之外没有任何存在的理由——一股令人陶醉的弗朗索瓦·勒·尚皮独特本质的气息。在日常的事件、平常的想法和陈词滥调的背后，我能听到，或者说无意中听到，一种语调，一种有节奏的话语，优美而陌生。 “行动”开始了：对我来说，它似乎更加晦涩难懂，因为在那些日子里，当我自己读书时，我经常在翻页时梦见一些完全不同的东西。当妈妈大声朗读给我听时，她忽略了所有的爱情场景，这一事实进一步增加了我对这个故事的了解。因此，磨坊主的妻子和男孩之间的关系中发生的所有奇怪的变化，只有爱情的诞生和成长才能解释的变化，在我看来似乎陷入了一个谜团中，其中的关键（正如我所能理解的那样）很容易相信）存在于查姆皮这个奇怪而悦耳的名字中，我不知道为什么，这个名字给拥有这个名字的男孩披上了它自己的明亮色彩，紫色而迷人。 即使我的母亲不是一个忠实的读者，但她在阅读一部作品时仍然令人钦佩，她在作品中通过她令人尊敬的简单解释和她甜美温柔的声音找到了真实的感情。在她的日常生活中也是如此，她所同情或钦佩的不是艺术作品，而是男人和女人：看到她以怎样的尊重从她的声音、她的手势、从她的整体中消除，真是令人感动。谈话时而充满欢乐的气氛，这可能会让一些很久以前失去孩子的母亲感到痛苦，时而回忆起某件事或周年纪念日，这可能会让某位老绅士想起他这些年的负担，时而谈论家庭话题，这可能会引起人们的注意。令一些年轻的文人感到厌烦。因此，当她大声朗读乔治·桑的散文时，这些散文处处让人想起妈妈从祖母那里学到的慷慨和道德品质，这些品质高于生活中的所有其他品质，而我直到很长时间才教她这些品质。后来，以同样的方式，不再将文学的其他品质置于首位；她煞费苦心地从她的声音中消除任何可能阻碍强有力的语言通道的弱点或矫揉造作，她提供了所有自然的温柔，所有他们所要求的奢华的甜蜜，这些短语似乎是为她的声音而创作的，可以说，这一切都在她的范围内。 她以他们所需要的语气来到他们面前，带着他们之前存在的亲切口音，口授他们，但在文字本身中找不到这种口音，通过这些方式，她在继续读下去时，平息了气氛，动词时态可能存在任何粗暴或不和谐，从而赋予不完美和过时的事物以慷慨中的所有甜蜜，以及爱情中的所有忧郁；将即将结束的句子引向即将开始的句子，音节的节奏时而加快，时而放慢，以便使它们尽管数量不同，形成统一的节奏，并为这相当平常的事情注入了气息。散文是一种生活，绵绵不断，充满感情。

My agony was soothed; I let myself be borne upon the current of this gentle night on which I had my mother by my side. I knew that such a night could not be repeated; that the strongest desire I had in the world, namely, to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of darkness, ran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes of others for such a concession as had been granted me this evening to be anything but a rare and casual exception. To-morrow night I should again be the victim of anguish and Mamma would not stay by my side. But when these storms of anguish grew calm I could no longer realise their existence; besides, tomorrow evening was still a long way off; I reminded myself that I should still have time to think about things, albeit that remission of time could bring me no access of power, albeit the coming event was in no way dependent upon the exercise of my will, and seemed not quite inevitable only because it was still separated from me by this short interval.
我的痛苦得到了缓解；我让自己沉浸在这个温柔的夜晚的潮流中，母亲在我身边。我知道这样的夜晚不能再重来；我在世界上最强烈的愿望，即让我的母亲在我的房间里度过悲伤的黑暗时光，与一般要求和其他人对今晚给予我的让步的愿望背道而驰绝非罕见和偶然的例外。明天晚上我将再次成为痛苦的受害者，而妈妈不会留在我身边。但当这些痛苦的风暴平静下来时，我就不再意识到它们的存在；此外，距离明天晚上还有很长的路要走。我提醒自己，我应该还有时间去思考事情，尽管时间的宽裕并不能让我获得力量，尽管即将发生的事情绝不取决于我意志的运用，而且似乎也不是完全不可避免的，只是因为它仍然和我隔着这么短的距离。

And so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake at night and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than this sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy background, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign will illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other parts of which remain plunged in darkness: broad enough at its base, the little parlour, the dining-room, the alluring shadows of the path along which would come M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the hall through which I would journey to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb, which constituted, all by itself, the tapering ‘elevation’ of an irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter; in a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though there had been no time there but seven o’clock at night. I must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these. But since the facts which I should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an exercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the pictures which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this residue of Combray. To me it was in reality all dead.
就这样，在之后的很长一段时间里，当我在夜里醒着，唤起对贡布雷的旧记忆时，我看到的只是这种发光的面板，在模糊和阴暗的背景下清晰可见，就像面板一样孟加拉的火或某种电子标志会从建筑物的前面照亮并剖析它，而建筑物的其他部分仍然陷入黑暗中：它的底部足够宽，小客厅，餐厅，沿途小路迷人的阴影斯旺先生，我的痛苦的无意识制造者，我将通过这个大厅到达那个楼梯的第一步，很难爬，它本身就构成了一个不规则金字塔的逐渐变细的“高度” ;在山顶，是我的卧室，有一条小通道，妈妈可以通过它的玻璃门进入。总而言之，总是在同一晚的时间看到，与所有可能的环境隔绝，在阴暗的背景下分离和孤独，所需的最低限度的风景（就像人们在一部老戏剧的开头看到的场景一样，因为它的在我脱衣服的戏剧性表演中，好像整个贡布雷只有两层楼，中间有一个细长的楼梯，好像除了晚上七点钟之外，那里没有时间。我必须承认，我可以向任何提问者保证，康布雷确实包含了其他场景，并且确实存在于除这些之外的其他时间。但是，由于我当时应该回忆起的事实只能通过意志的运用、通过我的智力记忆来促使，而且由于那种记忆向我们展示的过去的画面没有保留过去本身，所以我应该从来没有想过去思考贡布雷的这一残余。对我来说，它实际上已经全部死了。

Permanently dead? Very possibly.
永久死亡？很有可能。

There is a large element of hazard in these matters, and a second hazard, that of our own death, often prevents us from awaiting for any length of time the favours of the first.
这些事情中存在很大的危险因素，而第二个危险，即我们自己的死亡，常常使我们无法等待第一个危险的任何时间。

I feel that there is much to be said for the Celtic belief that the souls of those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior being, in an animal, in a plant, in some inanimate object, and so effectively lost to us until the day (which to many never comes) when we happen to pass by the tree or to obtain possession of the object which forms their prison. Then they start and tremble, they call us by our name, and as soon as we have recognised their voice the spell is broken. We have delivered them: they have overcome death and return to share our life.
我觉得凯尔特人的信仰有很多话要说，即我们失去的那些人的灵魂被囚禁在某种低等生物中，在动物、植物、某种无生命的物体中，因此实际上已经失去了我们，直到当我们碰巧路过那棵树或获得构成他们监狱的物体的那一天（对许多人来说永远不会到来）。然后他们开始颤抖，他们叫我们的名字，一旦我们认出他们的声音，咒语就被打破了。我们拯救了他们：他们已经克服了死亡并回来分享我们的生活。

And so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) which we do not suspect. And as for that object, it depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must die.
我们自己的过去也是如此。试图重新夺回它是徒劳的：我们智力的所有努力都必定是徒劳的。过去隐藏在领域之外的某个地方，超出了智力的范围，隐藏在我们不怀疑的某些物质对象中（在该物质对象将给我们带来的感觉中）。至于那个物体，在我们自己必死之前能否遇到它取决于机会。

Many years had elapsed during which nothing of Combray, save what was comprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there, had any existence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my mother, seeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did not ordinarily take. I declined at first, and then, for no particular reason, changed my mind. She sent out for one of those short, plump little cakes called ‘petites madeleines,’ which look as though they had been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim’s shell. And soon, mechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory—this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy? I was conscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake, but that it infinitely transcended those savours, could not, indeed, be of the same nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it signify? How could I seize upon and define it?
许多年过去了，除了剧院里的内容和我在那里睡觉的戏剧之外，贡布雷的一切对我来说都不再存在，当冬天的一天，当我回到家时，我的母亲看到我天冷了，给我倒了一些茶，这是我平时不喝的。我一开始拒绝了，后来无缘无故地改变了主意。她派人去买了一种又矮又胖的小蛋糕，叫做“小玛德琳蛋糕”，看起来就像是用朝圣者贝壳的凹槽扇贝模制而成的。很快，我机械地、疲惫地度过了沉闷的一天，并期待着明天的沮丧，我将一勺茶举到唇边，茶里泡了一小块蛋糕。温热的液体和面包屑一接触到我的上颚，我的全身就一阵颤抖，我停了下来，专注于正在发生的非凡变化。一种美妙的快乐侵入了我的感官，但这种快乐是单独的、超然的，没有任何迹象表明它的起源。立刻，生活的沧桑对我变得漠不关心，它的灾难无伤大雅，它的短暂是虚幻的——这种新的感觉对我产生了爱的效果，让我充满了宝贵的本质;或者更确切地说，这个本质并不在我身上，而是我自己。我现在不再觉得自己平庸、偶然、凡人。这种全能的喜悦从何而来？我意识到它与茶和糕点的味道有关，但它无限地超越了这些味道，确实不可能与它们具有相同的性质。它从哪里来？这意味着什么？我该如何抓住并定义它？

I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first, a third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time to stop; the potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object of my quest, the truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has called up in me, but does not itself understand, and can only repeat indefinitely with a gradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which I, too, cannot interpret, though I hope at least to be able to call upon the tea for it again and to find it there presently, intact and at my disposal, for my final enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my own mind. It is for it to discover the truth. But how? What an abyss of uncertainty whenever the mind feels that some part of it has strayed beyond its own borders; when it, the seeker, is at once the dark region through which it must go seeking, where all its equipment will avail it nothing. Seek? More than that: create. It is face to face with something which does not so far exist, to which it alone can give reality and substance, which it alone can bring into the light of day.
我喝了第二口，与第一口相比，我什么也没发现，第三口却比第二口少得多。是时候停下来了；药剂正在失去魔力。显然，我追寻的对象——真理，并不在杯子里，而是在我自己身上。茶召唤了我，但它本身并不理解，只能无限地重复着同样的见证，逐渐失去力量；我也无法解释这一点，尽管我希望至少能够再次召唤茶，并立即在那里找到它，完好无损并可供我使用，以供我最终的启蒙。我放下杯子，审视自己的内心。这是为了它发现真相。但如何呢？每当心灵感觉自己的某些部分已经偏离了自己的边界时，这是多么不确定的深渊啊！当它，探索者，立刻成为它必须去寻找的黑暗区域，在那里它的所有装备都对它毫无用处。寻找？不仅如此：创造。它面对的是迄今为止还不存在的东西，只有它才能赋予它现实和实质，只有它才能将其带入光明之中。

And I begin again to ask myself what it could have been, this unremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its existence, but only the sense that it was a happy, that it was a real state in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and vanished. I decide to attempt to make it reappear. I retrace my thoughts to the moment at which I drank the first spoonful of tea. I find again the same state, illumined by no fresh light. I compel my mind to make one further effort, to follow and recapture once again the fleeting sensation. And that nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out every obstacle, every extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit all attention to the sounds which come from the next room. And then, feeling that my mind is growing fatigued without having any success to report, I compel it for a change to enjoy that distraction which I have just denied it, to think of other things, to rest and refresh itself before the supreme attempt. And then for the second time I clear an empty space in front of it. I place in position before my mind’s eye the still recent taste of that first mouthful, and I feel something start within me, something that leaves its resting-place and attempts to rise, something that has been embedded like an anchor at a great depth; I do not know yet what it is, but I can feel it mounting slowly; I can measure the resistance, I can hear the echo of great spaces traversed.
我再次开始问自己它可能是什么，这种被遗忘的状态没有带来它存在的逻辑证据，但只有一种感觉，那就是它是一种幸福，它是一种真实的状态，在它的存在下还有其他意识状态。融化并消失。我决定尝试让它重新出现。我回想起我喝下第一勺茶的那一刻。我再次发现同样的状态，没有新鲜的光线照亮。我强迫自己的大脑再努力一点，去追踪并再次捕捉那转瞬即逝的感觉。为了避免任何事情干扰它的进程，我排除了所有障碍，所有无关的想法，我堵住耳朵，抑制对隔壁房间传来的声音的所有注意力。然后，我感觉我的头脑越来越疲惫，却没有任何成功的报告，我强迫它做出改变，去享受我刚刚拒绝的那种分心，去思考其他事情，在最高的尝试之前休息和恢复活力。然后我第二次在它前面清理出一块空地。我将第一口的味道放在我的脑海中，我感到我内心有某种东西开始了，某种东西离开了它的安息地并试图升起，某种东西已经像锚一样深深地嵌入了；我的身体里有一种东西在我的脑海里。我还不知道那是什么，但我能感觉到它正在慢慢上升；我可以测量阻力，我可以听到穿越广阔空间的回声。

Undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must be the image, the visual memory which, being linked to that taste, has tried to follow it into my conscious mind. But its struggles are too far off, too much confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless reflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of radiant hues, and I cannot distinguish its form, cannot invite it, as the one possible interpreter, to translate to me the evidence of its contemporary, its inseparable paramour, the taste of cake soaked in tea; cannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question, of what period in my past life.
毫无疑问，在我内心深处如此悸动的一定是图像，是视觉记忆，它与那种味道联系在一起，试图追随它进入我的意识头脑。但它的斗争太遥远、太混乱；我几乎看不到无色的倒影，其中混合着无法捕捉的旋转混合的光芒四射的色调，我无法区分它的形式，无法邀请它作为唯一可能的解释者，向我翻译它同时代的证据，它不可分割的情人，蛋糕泡茶的味道；不能要求它告诉我有什么特殊情况，在我过去的生活中的什么时期。

Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being? I cannot tell. Now that I feel nothing, it has stopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who can say whether it will ever rise? Ten times over I must essay the task, must lean down over the abyss. And each time the natural laziness which deters us from every difficult enterprise, every work of importance, has urged me to leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely of the worries of to-day and of my hopes for to-morrow, which let themselves be pondered over without effort or distress of mind.
它最终会到达我意识的清晰表面，这个记忆，这个古老的、死寂的时刻，同一时刻的磁力已经走到了如此远的地方，强求、扰乱、从我存在的最深处升起吗？我不能说。现在我感觉不到任何东西了，它已经停止了，也许又陷入了黑暗，谁能说它是否会从黑暗中升起呢？我必须十次重复这个任务，必须俯身于深渊。每一次，天生的懒惰阻止我们从事每一项困难的事业，每一项重要的工作，促使我把这件事放在一边，喝我的茶，只考虑今天的忧虑和我对今天的希望——明天，让我们不费力气或心烦意乱地思考自己。

And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before church-time), when I went to say good day to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks’ windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the forms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness. But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection.
突然记忆又回来了。味道就像贡布雷的周日早上（因为那些早上我在教堂时间之前没有出去），当我去她的卧室向她道早安时，我姑姑莱奥妮过去常常吃玛德琳小面包屑的味道。给我，先把它浸入她自己的一杯真茶或酸橙花茶中。在我品尝小玛德琳蛋糕之前，我的脑海里没有任何记忆。也许是因为我在这段时间里经常在糕点师橱窗里的托盘上看到这样的东西，但没有品尝过它们，所以它们的形象已经脱离了贡布雷时代的束缚，取而代之的是最近的其他东西。或许是因为那些被长期遗弃和遗忘的记忆，现在什么也没有留下来，一切都散了。事物的形式，包括糕点的小扇贝壳的形式，在其严格的宗教褶皱下如此丰富的感性，要么被消灭，要么已经休眠太久，以至于失去了可以让它们恢复的扩张能力。他们在我意识中的位置。但是，当从遥远的过去开始，一切都不再存在时，在人死之后，在物破碎散之后，仍然，孤独，更加脆弱，但更具活力，更加虚无，更加执着，更加忠实，气味和味道事物在很长一段时间内保持平静，就像灵魂一样，准备提醒我们，在其余一切的废墟中等待和希望它们的时刻；并在其本质的微小而几乎不可触摸的一滴中坚定不移地承载着巨大的记忆结构。

And once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had been all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon, the streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet, stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, permanent and recognisable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann’s park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of Combray and of its surroundings, taking their proper shapes and growing solid, sprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea.
一旦我立刻认出浸泡在她的酸橙花汤中的玛德琳面包屑的味道，那是我姨妈以前给我的（尽管我还不知道，而且必须推迟很久才能发现为什么这段记忆让我如此高兴）街上那栋灰色的老房子，也就是她的房间所在，像剧院的布景一样拔地而起，与小亭子相连，通向花园，花园是在它后面为我父母建造的（隔离的面板，直到那一刻我才看到）；还有房子，城镇，从早到晚，无论天气如何，午饭前我被送去的广场，我过去办事的街道，天气好的时候我们走的乡间小路。就像日本人取乐一样，他们在瓷碗里装满水，然后将小纸屑浸泡在其中，在此之前，这些纸屑还没有特征或形状，但是，一旦它们变湿，就会伸展并弯曲，呈现出颜色和独特的形状，成为花朵、房屋或人，永久且可辨认，因此在那一刻，我们花园和斯旺先生的公园里的所有花朵，以及维冯纳河上的睡莲，还有村里的好人们，他们的小住所和教区教堂、整个贡布雷及其周边地区，都在我的茶中形成了适当的形状并变得坚固，城镇和花园都一样。

Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt’s house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de l’Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesché, from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make Golo’s acquaintance and to chat with Geneviève de Brabant.
贡布雷在二十英里半径的远处，就像我们每年圣周到达那里时从铁路上看到的那样，只不过是一座教堂，它是这座城镇的缩影，代表着它，谈论着它，也为它服务。到了地平线，当它接近地平线时，在开阔的平原上，当牧羊人聚集他的羊时，它紧紧地裹住它长长的、黑色的斗篷，以避风，它的羊群的羊毛灰色的背部，这是它的一部分到处都是中世纪的城墙，其轮廓严格地呈圆形，就像原始绘画中的小镇一样。 居住在贡布雷有点令人沮丧，就像它的街道一样，这里的房屋是用乡下发黑的石头建造的，前面有台阶，山墙顶上向下投射出长长的阴影，光线昏暗，让人一看到就觉得很暗。太阳开始落山，客厅的窗帘拉开了。街道上刻有庄严的圣人名字，其中不少人出现在贡布雷早期领主的历史中，例如圣伊莱尔街、圣雅克街（我姨妈的房子就坐落在其中）、圣希尔德加德街，它穿过她的栏杆，还有圣埃斯普利特街，花园的小门就开在圣埃斯普利特街上。这些贡布雷街道存在于我记忆中如此遥远的四分之一中，它们所描绘的颜色与今天为我装饰的世界如此不同，事实上，它们中的一个和全部，以及高耸在它们之上的教堂现在对我来说，广场比我的魔法灯笼的投影更虚幻。有时我觉得能够再次穿过圣伊莱尔街，在Oiseau Flesché的老旅馆里订一间位于Oiseau街的房间，人行道上的窗户曾经散发出一股气味在同样温暖的安慰中，时不时地在我的脑海中浮现出烹饪的乐趣，这将是确保与看不见的世界的接触，这比结识戈洛并与吉纳维耶夫·德·布拉班特聊天更奇妙、超自然。

My grandfather’s cousin—by courtesy my great-aunt—with whom we used to stay, was the mother of that aunt Léonie who, since her husband’s (my uncle Octave’s) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray, then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who now never ‘came down,’ but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pré (as distinct from the Petit-Pré, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt’s life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see) fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I had just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already ‘raised’ and started to ‘set,’ puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the flowered quilt.
我祖父的表弟——礼貌地说是我的曾祖母——我们曾经住在一起，她是莱奥妮姨妈的母亲，自从她的丈夫（我叔叔奥克塔夫）去世后，她就逐渐拒绝离开，先是贡布雷，然后是她在的房子。贡布雷，然后是她的卧室，最后是她的床；现在，他再也没有“下来”，而是永远处于悲伤、身体疲惫、疾病、痴迷和宗教仪式的无限状态中。她自己的房间俯瞰着圣雅克街，这条路延伸了很长一段路，一直延伸到大普雷区（与小普雷区不同，小普雷区是镇中心的一片绿地，三条街交汇处）。这座建筑单调而灰色，几乎每扇门前都有三座高高的石阶，看起来就像某个哥特式雕塑家在他用来制作加略山或婴儿床的那块石头上刻出的一道深深的沟槽。我姨妈的生活现在几乎被限制在两个相邻的房间里，下午她会在其中一间休息，而另一间则在晾晒。 它们是那种乡村秩序的房间（就像在某些气候下，整片空气或海洋被无数我们看不见的原生动物照亮或散发出香味一样）用它们自身特殊的美德、智慧所产生的无数气味来吸引我们的嗅觉。 ，习惯，整个秘密的生活系统，看不见的，丰富的和深刻的道德，他们的气氛解决了；确实闻起来很自然，并且像邻近乡村的环境一样着色，但已经人性化，驯化，封闭，精致，巧妙，清澈的果冻，混合了离开果园进入储藏室的当季水果，气味随年份而变化，但充实的家庭气味，用热面包的甜味弥补了白霜的刺鼻，闻起来像乡村时钟一样慵懒而准时，流浪的气味，虔诚的气味；欣喜于平静只会带来更多的焦虑，而欣喜于忙碌对于那些路过他们中间却没有生活在他们中间的陌生人来说，这是诗歌的深层源泉。 那些房间的空气中弥漫着静谧的芬芳，如此滋养、如此多汁，以至于我一进入它们，就会感到一种贪婪的享受，尤其是在复活节假期的第一个早晨，仍然寒冷，那时我可以品尝到更全面的是，因为我当时刚到达贡布雷：在我进去向姨妈祝愿之前，我会在外面的房间里等一会儿，那里的太阳，仍然是冬日的阳光，已经爬进温暖的房间。它本身就在火前，它的两个砖墙之间已经点燃了，整个房间和里面的所有东西都沾满了煤烟的味道，使这个房间就像人们在乡村找到的那些巨大的平炉之一，或者一个带顶篷的壁炉架之一在古老的城堡里，人们坐在下面，希望外面的世界正在下雨或下雪，希望一场灾难性的洪水能够为舒适的休养所带来庇护和安全的浪漫；我会在祈祷桌和印花天鹅绒扶手椅之间来回走动，每把椅子都披着钩针编织的反黑麦卡萨，而炉火像馅饼一样烤着，房间的空气中弥漫着令人垂涎欲滴的气味，浓浓的凝结着，早晨的露水和阳光的清新已经“升起”并开始“凝固”，使它们膨化，给它们上釉，给它们开槽，然后将它们膨胀成一个看不见但不是摸不着的乡村蛋糕，一个巨大的酥皮糕点，里面几乎没有等待品尝橱柜、抽屉柜和带图案壁纸的更坚硬、更精致、更体面但也更干燥的气味，我总是带着一种不承认的暴食回来，把自己埋在不起眼的、树脂般的、沉闷的东西里。 ，难消化，还有花被子的果香。

In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: ‘I must not forget that I never slept a wink’—for ‘never sleeping a wink’ was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Françoise would not ‘call’ her, but would simply ‘come to’ her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished to ‘be quiet’ or to ‘rest’; and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say ‘what made me wake up,’ or ‘I dreamed that,’ she would flush and at once correct herself.
在隔壁房间，我能听到姨妈轻声自言自语。她从来不说话，除非声音很小，因为她相信她脑子里有什么东西坏了，飘浮在那里，她可能会因为说话太大声而取代它；但她从来不会长时间停留，即使是独自一人时，也不说什么，因为她相信这对她的喉咙有好处，并且通过保持那里的血液循环，可以减少她容易遭受的窒息和其他疼痛。 ;此外，在她过着完全惰性的生活中，她对自己的任何感觉都异常重视，赋予它们千变万化的普遍性，这使她很难保守秘密，而且，没有一个她可以与之交流的知己她常常通过不断的独白向自己传播它们，这是她唯一的活动形式。不幸的是，由于养成了大声思考的习惯，她并不总是留意隔壁房间里没有人，我经常听到她对自己说：“我不能忘记，我从来没有合眼过” ——因为“从不睡觉”是她杰出的标志，在我们的家庭词汇中得到承认和尊重；早上，弗朗索瓦丝不会“打电话”给她，而只是“来到”她身边。白天，当姨妈想小睡时，我们就说她想“安静”或“休息”；当她在谈话中忘记说“是什么让我醒来”或“我梦见了”时，她会脸红并立即纠正自己。

After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling ‘upset,’ she would ask instead for her ‘tisane,’ and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist’s little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details—the charming prodigality of the chemist—details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses—marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been ‘in bloom’—shewed me that these were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist’s package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower. Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.
等一分钟后，我就进去亲吻她；弗朗索瓦丝正在给她泡茶；或者，如果我姨妈感到“心烦意乱”，她会要求她要“药草”，而我的责任就是从药剂师的小包装中摇出泡在沸水中所需的柠檬花量，放在盘子上。水。茎干的干燥使它们扭曲成一个奇妙的格子，在格子的间隙中，浅色的花朵开放，仿佛画家将它们排列在那里，将它们组合成最具装饰性的姿势。失去或改变了自己外观的叶子，呈现出那些而不是想象中最不协调的东西，就好像苍蝇的透明翅膀或标签的空白侧面或玫瑰花瓣被收集和捣碎，或像鸟一样交织在一起为它们的巢编织材料。一千个琐碎的小细节——化学家迷人的挥霍——那些本来可以通过人工准备而消除的细节，给了我一种发现的乐趣，就像在一本书中，人们惊讶地读到一个认识的人的名字一样。这些确实是真正的椴树花，就像我从火车上下来时在车站大道上看到的那些一样，经过了改变，但只是因为它们不是仿制品，而是同样的花，但已经变老了。 由于每个新角色都只是旧角色的变形，因此在这些灰色的小球中，我认出了提前采摘的绿色花蕾；但最重要的是，玫​​瑰色、月色、温柔的光芒照亮了脆弱的茎森林中的花朵，它们像金色的小玫瑰一样悬挂在花朵上——就像旧墙上的光芒仍然标志着消失的壁画的地方一样，树上那些已经“盛开”的部分和那些没有“盛开”的部分之间的区别——告诉我，这些花瓣是在开花之前，化学家的包裹在春天温暖的夜晚经过防腐处理的。那玫瑰色的烛光仍然是他们的颜色，但在现在属于他们的生命的减少中半熄灭和死寂，这可以称为花朵的黄昏。不久，我姨妈就可以浸入沸腾的汤汁中，她会在其中品尝死花或凋谢花的味道，还有一点玛德琳蛋糕，当它足够软时，她会递给我一块。

At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-Célestins, might be found her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Françoise.
她床的一侧放着一个柠檬木制成的黄色大抽屉柜，还有一张既充当药房又充当祭坛的桌子，桌子上放着一尊圣母雕像和一瓶维希塞莱斯汀葡萄酒。 ，可能会找到她的服务手册和医疗处方，以及她在床上履行对灵魂和身体的职责所需的一切，以保持胃蛋白酶和晚祷的适当时间。床的另一边靠着窗户：她的眼前就是街道，她会像波斯王子一样从早到晚地阅读贡布雷的日常但古老的编年史，以排解生活中的单调乏味，之后她将与弗朗索瓦丝详细讨论这个问题。

I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns-er the beads of a rosary, and she would say to me: ‘Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and if you see Françoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.’
我不会和姨妈待上五分钟，她就会把我送走，以免我让她累了。她会伸手让我亲吻她悲伤的额头，苍白而毫无生气，在这么早的时间里，她还没有在额头上编好假发，透过假发，骨头闪闪发光，就像荆棘王冠的尖端——呃，是荆棘的珠子。一串念珠，她会对我说：‘现在，我可怜的孩子，你必须走开；去准备弥撒；如果你在楼下看到弗朗索瓦丝，请告诉她不要在你身上逗留太久。她必须尽快过来看看我是否想要什么。

Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt’s service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to Combray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year’s Day, before going into my great-aunt’s house, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said: ‘Now, be careful. Don’t make any mistake. Wait until you hear me say ‘Good morning, Françoise,’ and I touch your arm before you give it to her.’ No sooner had we arrived in my aunt’s dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the ‘upper classes’ which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: ‘Good morning, Françoise.’ At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise. We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of ‘the family’ (for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of him, and whether he took after his granny.
弗朗索瓦丝多年来一直为我姨妈服务，当时并不怀疑有一天她会完全调到我们家，在我们在姨妈家里度过的几个月里，她有点倾向于抛弃我姨妈。在我还是个婴儿的时候，在我们第一次去贡布雷之前，当我的姨妈莱奥妮仍然和她的母亲一起在巴黎过冬时，我对弗朗索瓦丝的了解是如此之少，以致于元旦那天，在进入我伟大的大学之前，我对弗朗索瓦丝的了解非常少。在姨妈家，妈妈把一枚五法郎的硬币放在我手里，说：‘现在，小心一点。不要犯任何错误。等你听到我说“早上好，弗朗索瓦丝”，我摸摸你的手臂，然后你再把它交给她。“我们一到达姨妈黑暗的大厅，我们就看到在黑暗中，在一顶雪帽的褶边下僵硬而脆弱，仿佛是用糖纺成的，带着期待的感激之情的微笑的同心波浪。那是弗朗索瓦丝，一动不动，笔直地站在走廊的小门口，就像壁龛里的圣人雕像一样。当我们越来越习惯这种宗教黑暗时，我们可以从她的面容中看出对全人类的无私的爱，混合着对“上层阶级”的温柔尊重，这使她内心最尊贵的部分升起了接受她应得的希望。报酬。妈妈猛地捏住我的手臂，大声说道：“早上好，弗朗索瓦丝。”听到这个信号，我的手指分开，硬币掉了下来，在一只困惑但伸出的手中找到了一个容器。但自从我们开始去贡布雷以来，我就没有比弗朗索瓦丝更了解的人了。 我们是她的最爱，至少在最初的几年里，虽然她对我们的关心和对我姨妈的关心一样，但她更喜欢我们，因为除了我们作为“家庭”一部分的尊严之外，她还更喜欢我们。 （因为她像任何希腊悲剧演员一样尊重那些将家庭成员团结在一起的无形纽带），而不是她惯用的雇主的新鲜魅力。因此，她会多么高兴地欢迎我们，多么悲伤地抱怨我们到达的那天，复活节前夕，天气对我们来说仍然如此糟糕，当时经常有冰冷的风；妈妈则询问她的女儿和侄子们的情况，问她的孙子是否好看，他们打算把他怎么样，以及他是否像他的奶奶。

Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and their lives.
后来，当房间里没有其他人时，妈妈知道弗朗索瓦丝仍在为她去世多年的父母哀悼，就会和蔼地谈论他们，问她无数关于他们和他们的生活的小问题。

She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when Françoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to her, with a smile: ‘Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away, and you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will make the best of it, won’t you?’
她猜测弗朗索瓦丝不太喜欢她的女婿，而且他破坏了她探望女儿的乐趣，因为当他在场时，两人不能如此自由地交谈。有一天，当弗朗索瓦丝要去离贡布雷几英里的家时，妈妈微笑着对她说：“告诉我，弗朗索瓦丝，如果于连不得不离开，而你整天只能独自照顾玛格丽特，你会感到非常遗憾，但你会尽力而为，不是吗？

And Françoise answered, laughing: ‘Madame knows everything; Madame is worse than the X-rays’ (she pronounced ‘x’ with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman’s, daring to employ a scientific term) ‘they brought here for Mme. Octave, which see what is in your heart’—and she went off, disturbed that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself.
弗朗索瓦丝笑着回答说：“夫人什么都知道；”夫人比X光更糟糕”（她艰难地发音“x”，并带着对她这个不识字的女人的蔑视微笑，敢于使用科学术语）“他们为夫人带来了这里。”奥克塔夫，它知道你心里在想什么”——然后她就走了，担心有人会关心她，也许担心我们不应该看到她流泪：妈妈是第一个让她感到高兴的人。她的农民生活，带着简单的欢乐和悲伤，可能会引起一些兴趣，也可能成为除她之外的其他人的悲伤或快乐的源泉。

My aunt resigned herself to doing without Françoise to some extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o’clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt’s maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality.
在我们拜访期间，我姨妈在某种程度上接受了没有弗朗索瓦丝的日子，因为她知道我的母亲非常感谢这位如此活跃和聪明的女仆的服务，她在早上五点钟在她的厨房里，在一盏灯下看起来也很聪明。帽子的硬挺而耀眼的褶边似乎是用瓷器制成的，就像去教堂时穿着的一样；她以正确的方式做每件事，她像一匹马一样辛劳，无论她健康还是生病，但没有噪音，没有做任何事情的样子；我姨妈的女仆中唯一一位当妈妈要热水或黑咖啡时，她会真正把它们煮沸；她是那些在家里最不令陌生人满意的仆人之一，毫无疑问，因为他们不费吹灰之力去征服他，也不对他给予特别的关注，因为他们很清楚自己并不真正需要帮助。在他们被逐出房子之前，他将不再被邀请到房子里；另一方面，他们对那些已经测试和证明了自己真正能力的主人和情妇非常忠诚，不寻求那种肤浅的回应，那种奴性的和蔼可亲，这可能会给陌生人留下好印象，但往往隐藏着一种彻底的态度。精神贫瘠，再多的训练也无法产生哪怕一丝个性。

When Françoise, having seen that my parents had everything they required, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to some important event.
当弗朗索瓦丝看到我父母拥有他们需要的一切后，首先再次上楼给我姨妈注射胃蛋白酶，并向她询问午餐要吃什么，很少有早晨过去，但她被要求发表意见，或对某些重要事件提供解释。

‘Just fancy, Françoise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should not be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.’
“只是想象一下，弗朗索瓦丝，夫人。古皮尔迟到了一刻钟多才去接她妹妹：如果她在路上再耽误一些时间，如果她在高地之后进来，我一点也不奇怪。

‘Well, there’d be nothing wonderful in that,’ would be the answer. Or:
答案是：“好吧，那没什么了不起的”。或者：

‘Françoise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme. Imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot has: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you’ve been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able to get some like these for our visitors.’
“弗朗索瓦丝，如果你五分钟前进来，你就会看到弗朗索瓦丝女士了。”安伯特带着一些芦笋过去，芦笋的大小是卡洛特妈妈的两倍：一定要试着从她的厨师那里找出她从哪里弄来的。你知道今年春天你在所有的酱汁中都加入了芦笋；你也许可以为我们的访客得到一些这样的东西。

‘I shouldn’t be surprised if they came from the Curé’s,’ Françoise would say, and:
“如果它们来自本堂神父，我不会感到惊讶，”弗朗索瓦丝会说，并且：

‘I’m sure you wouldn’t, my poor Françoise,’ my aunt would reply, raising her shoulders. ‘From the Curé’s, indeed! You know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus at all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of course, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year.’ Or:
“我确信你不会的，我可怜的弗朗索瓦丝，”我姨妈会抬起肩膀回答道。 “确实是从本堂那里来的！”你很清楚，除了可怜的芦笋小树枝，他永远不会种植任何东西，而不是芦笋。我告诉你这些和我的手臂一样粗。当然，不是你的手臂，而是我可怜的手臂，今年它又变细了。’或者：

‘Françoise, didn’t you hear that bell just now! It split my head.’
“弗朗索瓦丝，你刚才没有听到铃声吗！”它让我头疼。

‘No, Mme. Octave.’
“不，夫人。八度。’

‘Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that. It was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once and they went off along the Rue de l’Oiseau. There must be some child ill.’
‘啊，可怜的女孩，你的头骨一定很厚；你可以为此感谢上帝。是马格隆来接皮佩罗医生的。他立刻和她一起出来，他们沿着瓦索街走去。肯定有某个孩子生病了。

‘Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!’ would come with a sigh from Françoise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to lament. Or:
‘噢，亲爱的，亲爱的；弗朗索瓦丝会叹息一声，她听到任何灾难降临在她不认识的人身上，即使是在世界的某个遥远的地方，她都会开始哀叹。或者：

‘Françoise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of course, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten that she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called me home too; I don’t know what has become of my head since I lost my poor Octave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.’
“弗朗索瓦丝，刚才他们为谁鸣响了过路铃？噢，天哪，当然，这是给我夫人的。卢梭。想到我忘记了她那天晚上去世了。确实，现在也是主呼召我回家的时候了；我不知道自从我失去了可怜的八度后我的脑子变成了什么样子。但我在浪费你的时间，我的好女孩。”

‘Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time didn’t sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn’t gone out.’
“确实不，夫人。奥克塔夫，我的时间并不那么宝贵；谁创造了我们的时间，谁就没有把时间卖给我们。我只是想看看我的火还没有熄灭。

In this way Françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for Françoise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house.
通过这种方式，弗朗索瓦丝和我姨妈在上午的会议中对当天最早发生的事情进行了批判性的评估。但有时这些事情显得如此神秘或如此令人震惊，以至于我姨妈觉得她迫不及待地等到弗朗索瓦丝上楼的时候，然后屋子里就会响起令人敬畏的四重钟声。

‘But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,’ Françoise would begin. ‘Are you feeling faint?’
“但是，夫人。奥克塔夫，现在还不是胃蛋白酶的时间，”弗朗索瓦丝开始说道。 “你感觉头晕吗？”

‘No, thank you, Françoise,’ my aunt would reply, ‘that is to say, yes; for you know well that there is very seldom a time when I don’t feel faint; one day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am; but that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn’t know at all. Run and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It’s not often that Théodore can’t tell you who a person is.’
“不，谢谢你，弗朗索瓦丝，”我姨妈会回答，“也就是说，是的；”因为你很清楚，我很少不感到晕眩；有一天我也会像夫人一样去世。卢梭，在我知道自己身在何处之前；但这不是我打电话的原因。您是否相信我刚才看到了，就像我看到您一样清楚，夫人。古皮尔和一个我根本不认识的小女孩。跑去从卡缪那里拿一便士的盐。西奥多无法告诉你一个人是谁的情况并不常见。

‘But that must be M. Pupin’s daughter,’ Françoise would say, preferring to stick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice already into Camus’s shop that morning.
“但那一定是普潘先生的女儿，”弗朗索瓦丝会说，她宁愿坚持直接解释，因为那天早上她可能已经两次走进加缪的店了。

‘M. Pupin’s daughter! Oh, that’s a likely story, my poor Françoise. Do you think I should not have recognised M. Pupin’s daughter!’
'M。普平的女儿！哦，这是一个可能的故事，我可怜的弗朗索瓦丝。你认为我不应该认出普平先生的女儿吗？

‘But I don’t mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one who goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his morning.’
“但我指的不是大的，夫人。八度；我指的是那个小女孩，她在 Jouy 上学。我好像早上就见过她一次了。

‘Oh, if that’s what it is!’ my aunt would say, ‘she must have come over for the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over for the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and ring her sister’s door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the boy from Galopin’s go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for Mme. Goupil.’
“哦，如果真是这样的话！”我姨妈会说，“她一定是过来过节的。”是的，就是这样。不用问，她会过来过节的。但我们很快就会见到夫人。萨泽拉特过来按响她姐姐的门铃，准备吃午饭。就这样了！我看到加洛平家的男孩拿着一个馅饼走过。你会看到馅饼是给夫人的。古皮尔。”

‘Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won’t be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it’s not so early as it was,’ would be the answer, for Françoise, who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction.
‘一旦夫人。古皮尔夫人家里有人。奥克塔夫，你很快就会看到她所有的家人都去那里吃午饭，因为现在已经不像以前那么早了，”弗朗索瓦丝会这样回答，她急于下楼去照顾我们自己的饭菜，我并不为让我姨妈承受这样的干扰而感到遗憾。

‘Oh! not before midday!’ my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation, darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle. ‘And it will come in the middle of my luncheon!’ she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time. ‘At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates?’ These were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her spectacles and spell out: ‘Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,’ ‘Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,’ and smile, and say ‘Very good indeed.’
'哦！中午之前不行！”姨妈会以一种无奈的语气回答，同时不安地瞥一眼时钟，但是偷偷地看，以免让人看出她已经放弃了所有尘世的欢乐，却在生活中找到了强烈的满足。学习那位女士。古皮尔原本期待有人来吃午饭，但遗憾的是，她还必须等一个多小时才能欣赏这一奇观。 “它会在我的午餐中间出现！”她会自言自语道。她的午餐本身就很让人分心，所以她不喜欢其他人同时来。 “至少，你不会忘记在其中一个平板上给我奶油鸡蛋吗？”这是唯一一个上面有图片的盘子，我姨妈过去常常在每顿饭上通过阅读可能有图片的说明来取乐。被送到了她的面前。她会戴上眼镜，拼出：“阿里巴巴与四十大盗”、“阿拉丁，神灯”，然后微笑着说，“确实很好。”

‘I may as well go across to Camus...’ Françoise would hazard, seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.
“我不妨去加缪那里……”弗朗索瓦丝见姨妈不再打算送她去那里，便冒险说道。

‘No, no; it’s not worth while now; it’s certain to be the Pupin girl. My poor Françoise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.’
'不，不;现在不值得了；肯定是普平女孩。我可怜的弗朗索瓦丝，我很抱歉让你无缘无故地上楼来。

But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for Françoise, since at Combray a person whom one ‘didn’t know at all’ was as incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena, careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one ‘did know,’ either personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be Mme. Sauton’s son discharged from the army, or the Abbé Perdreau’s niece come home from her convent, or the Curé’s brother, a tax-collector at Châteaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you ‘didn’t know at all,’ simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Curé had given warning that they expected their ‘strangers.’ In the evening, when I came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom my grandfather didn’t know:
但正如我姨妈清楚地知道的那样，她为弗朗索瓦丝打电话并不是无缘无故的，因为在贡布雷，一个“根本不认识”的人就像任何神话中的神一样令人难以置信，而且很容易引起人们的注意。请忘记，每次在圣埃斯普里街或广场上出现这些令人困惑的现象之后，仔细而详尽的研究总是将这个神话般的怪物缩小到一个人“确实认识的人”的比例， ”无论是个人还是抽象意义上，他或她的公民身份或多或少与贡布雷的某个家庭有密切的关系。原来是Mme。索顿的儿子从军队退伍，或者佩德罗神父的侄女从修道院回家，或者神父的兄弟，沙托丹的一名税务员，刚刚靠养老金退休，或者来到贡布雷度假。第一次注意到他们时，你会对贡布雷中可能存在你“根本不认识”的人印象深刻，仅仅是因为你未能立即认出或辨认出他们。然而，早在很久以前，夫人。索顿和本堂神父警告说，他们期待着“陌生人”。晚上，当我进来上楼告诉姨妈我们散步时发生的事情时，如果我鲁莽地对她说我们已经过去了，在老桥附近，有一个我祖父不认识的人：

‘A man grandfather didn’t know at all!’ she would exclaim. ‘That’s a likely story.’ None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would be summoned. ‘Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn’t know at all?’
“祖父根本不知道这个人！”她会感叹道。 “这是一个可能的故事。”尽管如此，她会对这个消息感到有点不安，她希望正确地了解细节，所以我的祖父会被传唤。 “叔叔，你在老桥附近经过的是谁？一个你根本不认识的人？

‘Why, of course I did,’ my grandfather would answer; ‘it was Prosper, Mme. Bouilleboeuf’s gardener’s brother.’
“为什么，我当然这么做了，”我祖父会回答。 “这是普洛斯帕，夫人。 Bouilleboeuf 的园丁的兄弟。

‘Ah, well!’ my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; ‘and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn’t know at all!’ After which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she ‘didn’t know at all’ she would think about it incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours.
“啊，好吧！”我姨妈会说，她又平静了，但还是有点红。 “那个男孩告诉我，你遇到了一个你根本不认识的人！”之后，我会被警告要更加小心我所说的话，不要因为轻率的言论而让我的姨妈感到不安。在贡布雷，无论是动物还是人，每个人都那么出名，如果我姨妈碰巧看到一只她“根本不认识”的狗经过，她就会不停地思考，致力于解决难以理解的问题。质疑她所有的归纳天赋和闲暇时间。

‘That will be Mme. Sazerat’s dog,’ Françoise would suggest, without any real conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not ‘split her head.’
“那就是夫人。”萨泽拉的狗，”弗朗索瓦丝会建议，没有任何真正的信念，但希望和平，这样我的姨妈就不会“劈开她的头”。

‘As if I didn’t know Mme. Sazerat’s dog!’—for my aunt’s critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact.
‘好像我不认识夫人一样。萨泽拉特的狗！”——因为我姨妈挑剔的头脑不会轻易承认任何新鲜事实。

‘Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from Lisieux.’
“啊，但这将是加洛平先生从利雪给她带来的新狗。”

‘Oh, if that’s what it is!’
“哦，如果真是这样的话！”

‘It seems, it’s a most engaging animal,’ Françoise would go on, having got the story from Théodore, ‘as clever as a Christian, always in a good temper, always friendly, always everything that’s nice. It’s not often you see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it’s high time I left you; I can’t afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it’s nearly ten o’clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I’ve still to dress the asparagus.’
“看来，这是一种最迷人的动物，”弗朗索瓦丝从西奥多那里听到了这个故事，接着说道，“像基督徒一样聪明，总是脾气很好，总是友好，总是一切都很好。在那个年纪，你很少能看到动物表现得如此乖巧。女士。奥克塔夫，我是时候离开你了；我不能留在这里自娱自乐；你看，已经快十点了，我的火还没有生起来，我还要给芦笋调味。”

‘What, Françoise, more asparagus! It’s a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.’
“什么，弗朗索瓦丝，再来点芦笋！”这是今年芦笋的常见病害：你会让我们的巴黎人厌倦的。

‘No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They’ll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won’t eat it out of the back of their spoons, you’ll see.’
“不，不，奥克塔夫夫人，他们很喜欢它。他们很快就会从教堂回来，就像猎人一样饥饿，而且他们不会从勺子后面吃东西，你会看到的。

‘Church! why, they must be there now; you’d better not lose any time. Go and look after your luncheon.’
'教会！哎呀，他们现在一定就在那儿了；你最好不要浪费任何时间。去准备你的午餐吧。

While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Françoise I would have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the hall—all sculptured stone and painted glass—of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker’s and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise—the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire—the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock’s tail, then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was following my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of forget-me-nots in glass.
当我的姨妈以这种方式与弗朗索瓦丝闲聊时，我会陪我的父母去参加弥撒。我多么喜欢它：我仍然能清楚地看到它，我们在贡布雷的教堂！我们进去的那个旧门廊，黑色的，布满了洞，像一个除草机，已经磨损变形，两侧有深深的皱纹（它引导我们去的圣水罐也是如此），就像温和的放牧一样进入教堂的农妇的斗篷的触摸，以及浸入水中的手指，经过多年的重复，已经成功地获得了一种破坏性的力量，在石头上留下了深刻的印象，在上面刻下了车辙，就像手推车留下的车辙一样。 -每天都在石头门柱上行驶的轮子。它的纪念石，埋葬在那里的贡布雷修道院院长的高贵尘土，为唱诗班提供了一种精神铺垫，它们本身不再是坚硬和无生命的物质，因为时间已经软化了它们，使它们变得甜美。它们像蜂蜜一样融化，流过它们应有的边缘，要么在乳白色的泡沫波浪中涌出，从它的位置上冲洗掉华丽的哥特式首都，淹没大理石地板上的白色紫罗兰；或者重新吸收到它们的限制中，进一步收缩了一个古怪的拉丁铭文，在其被缩减的字符的排列中带来了新鲜的幻想色彩，将某个单词的两个字母闭合在一起，而其中其余的字母则不成比例地分散。它的窗户从来没有像太阳几乎没有照耀的日子那样明亮，因此，如果外面阴暗，你也可以确定教堂里的天气晴朗。 其中一个从上到下充满了一个孤独的人物，就像扑克牌上的国王一样，他住在他的石头天篷下，天地之间；在它倾斜的阴影的蓝光下，在工作日，有时，在中午，当没有服务时（在那些罕见的时刻之一，通风，空荡荡的教堂，在阳光下展现出它所有丰富的色彩，不知何故更人性化，更奢华家具，似乎有一种几乎适合居住的气氛，就像一些中世纪宅邸的大厅——全是雕刻的石头和彩绘玻璃），你可能会看到夫人。萨泽拉特跪了一会儿，在她旁边的椅子上躺下了一个捆得很整齐的小蛋糕包，这些小蛋糕是她刚在面包店买的，准备带回家吃午餐。在另一幅画中，一座玫瑰色的雪山，在它的脚下正在进行一场战斗，似乎也冻结了窗户，它被阴雨夹雪膨胀和扭曲，就像一块玻璃，雪花飘过并附着在上面，但雪花照亮了日出时——毫无疑问，同样的情况，祭坛上的壁画被染成了紫色，色彩如此清新，以至于它们似乎被从外面射来的光线照射到祭坛上，很快就熄灭了，而不是被涂上并永久地固定在祭坛上。石头。所有这些都如此古老，以至于你可以到处看到它们银色的古老物在几个世纪的尘埃中闪闪发光，并在其破旧的光彩中展示着可爱的玻璃挂毯的绳索。 其中有一个是一块高高的面板，由一百个小矩形窗户组成，主要是蓝色的，就像一场旨在迷惑国王查理六世的耐心游戏；但是，要么是因为一缕阳光透过它，要么是因为我自己的视线转移到了窗户上，窗户的颜色逐渐消失，又轮流重新点燃，形成了罕见而短暂的火焰——下一刻它就呈现出所有的彩虹色。孔雀尾巴的形状，然后在一场火焰般的梦幻般的阵雨中摇晃和摇摆，从黑暗的岩石拱顶的腹股沟处升起，沿着潮湿的墙壁落下，仿佛它沿着我所在的蜿蜒钟乳石的彩虹洞穴的床铺。跟随我的父母，他们走在我前面，手里紧握着祈祷书。过了一会儿，小小的菱形窗户就呈现出深深的透明感，蓝宝石的坚不可摧的硬度聚集在一些巨大的胸甲上。但除此之外，还可以辨认出比所有这些宝藏更珍贵的太阳转瞬即逝的微笑，在这里也可以看到并感受到它，在蓝色和温和的洪水中，它冲刷着砖石，就像在广场的人行道上一样或市场的稻草；甚至在复活节前的第一个周日，当我们在复活节前来到这里时，它也会让我对外面的黑暗和光秃秃的大地感到安慰，因为它会绽放出花朵，就像旧历史上圣路易斯继承人的某个春天一样，这令人眼花缭乱的花朵玻璃中勿忘我的镀金地毯。

Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of Guermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one another, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch of red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite ‘gone’ at the top, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing upper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was said, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people’s supernatural passage—all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space—the name of the fourth being Time—which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat’s wing of stone, Théodore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert’s little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, ‘by a crystal lamp which, on the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.’
两幅高经纱挂毯代表了以斯帖的加冕礼（据传说，织工将法国国王之一的面貌赋予了亚哈随鲁，而以斯帖则以盖尔芒特夫人的面容为自己的情人）。它们的颜色相互融合，为画面增添了表情、浮雕和光线。艾丝特嘴唇上的一抹红色已经超出了轮廓。她衣服上的黄色铺得如此油腻、丰满，获得了一种坚固感，在逐渐退去的气氛中大胆地脱颖而出。而树木的绿色，在面板下部的丝绸和羊毛中仍然明亮，但在顶部已经完全“消失”，以更苍白的方案分开，在黑色的树干之上，泛黄的上部树枝，晒黑了看不见的太阳的锐利但斜向的光线将其一半遮盖了。所有这些东西，更重要的是，来自对我来说几乎是传奇人物的人物来到教堂的宝藏（例如据说由圣埃洛伊制作并由达戈伯特赠送的金色十字架，以及坟墓）日耳曼路易的儿子们用斑岩和珐琅铜制作的），正因为如此，当我们走向椅子时，我常常走进教堂，就像走进一个仙女出没的山谷一样，乡村人惊讶地看到岩石，一棵树，一片沼泽，小人物超自然通道的有形证据——所有这些东西对我来说使教堂成为与镇上其他地方完全不同的东西；可以说，这座建筑占据了四个维度的空间——第四个维度的名字是时间——它与那个古老的中殿一起航行了几个世纪，在那里，一个又一个的海湾，一个又一个的教堂，似乎在延伸，压制和征服不仅仅是几码的土壤，而是整个建筑胜利地出现的每一个连续的时代，将十一世纪粗犷的野蛮行为隐藏在其厚厚的墙壁中，透过墙壁，看不到那些长期停顿和的沉重拱门。除了靠近门廊的地方，塔楼楼梯旁的一堵墙上刻有一条深槽外，其他地方都被粗方石块遮住了。即使在那儿，野蛮的行为也被优雅的哥特式拱廊所掩盖，拱廊风骚地压在上面，就像一排成年姐妹，为了把他隐藏起来，不被陌生人看到，微笑着站在一个乡下人、无礼和恶劣的面前。穿好衣服的弟弟；广场上空矗立着一座塔楼，它俯瞰着圣路易，现在似乎仍然注视着他。并把它的墓穴推入墨洛温王朝夜晚的黑暗中，穿过西奥多或他的妹妹用一根蜡烛为我们照亮了西格伯特小女儿的坟墓，里面有一个深洞，就像据说，“在法兰克公主被谋杀的那天晚上，水晶灯自动留下了悬挂在化石床上的金链子”。后殿至今仍存在，水晶既没有破碎，光线也没有熄灭，并没有将自己埋在石头里，而是轻轻地从石头中穿过。’

And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but instinctively I exclaimed ‘The Church!’
然后是贡布雷的后殿：我该怎么说呢？它是如此粗俗，如此缺乏艺术美感，甚至没有宗教精神。从外面看，由于它所控制的街道交叉口位于较低的水平，它的长城是从一个无面方石的地下室向上推起的，上面布满了燧石，所有这些都没有什么特别的教会色彩；窗户的高度似乎不正常，整个外观不像是教堂，而是监狱的围墙。当然，在后来的岁月里，如果我回忆起我所见过的所有辉煌的后殿，我永远不会想到将贡布雷的后殿与其中任何一个进行比较。只是有一天，我走出某乡村小镇的一条小街，发现了三条小巷交汇在一起，面对它们的是一堵古老的墙，它被摩擦、磨损、摇摇欲坠，而且异常高。它的窗户位于头顶上方，具有与贡布雷后殿相同的不对称外观。在那一刻，我并没有像在沙特尔或兰斯那样对自己说，在其建筑中宗教感情的表达有多么强烈，但我本能地惊呼“教堂！”

The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue Saint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours, Mme. Loiseau’s house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its walls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might have had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne numbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau’s and after leaving M. Rapin’s, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss.
教堂！一位亲爱的、熟悉的朋友；紧邻圣伊莱尔街，其北门被其两位邻居，夫人。卢瓦索的房子和拉宾先生的药房，墙壁紧靠着它们，没有空隙；贡布雷的一个普通公民，她可能在街上有她的电话号码，但贡布雷的街道上也有电话号码，人们觉得邮递员应该在早上巡视她的门前停下来，然后再去见夫人。尽管如此，在卢瓦索的教堂和离开拉宾先生的教堂之后，在教堂和贡布雷教堂以外的一切事物之间，仍然存在着一条清晰的界限，我从未成功地从我的脑海中消除过它。夫人可能徒劳无功。卢瓦索在她的窗台上种满了紫红色的倒挂金钟，这些紫红色的花养成了一个坏习惯，那就是让枝条始终向各个方向拖曳，头朝下，当它们长得足够大，可以品尝到生活的乐趣时，它们的花朵就不再重要了。 ，而不是去教堂黑暗的前面，让他们紫色、充血的脸颊凉爽起来；对我来说，这种行为根本没有使倒挂金钟神圣化。在花朵和它们所倚靠的黑色石头之间，如果我的眼睛看不出任何间隔，我的脑海里就留下了深渊的印象。

>From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering continually in all directions, he would say: ‘Come, get your wraps together, we are there.’ And on one of the longest walks we ever took from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire’s steeple, but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of ‘nature,’ this little sign of art, this single indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the wild vine.
>从很远的地方就能辨认出圣伊莱尔的尖塔，它在贡布雷尚未出现的地平线上刻下了令人难忘的形状；当复活节期间从巴黎带我们下来的火车上，我父亲看到它时，它依次滑入天空的每一个褶皱，它的小铁旋塞不断转向各个方向，他会说：“来吧，在我们从贡布雷出发的最长的徒步旅行之一中，有一个地方，狭窄的道路突然出现在一片广阔的平原上，地平线上被一片片森林所封闭，上面生长着玫瑰和花草。孤零零地矗立着圣伊莱尔尖塔的精尖，但如此锋利，如此粉红色，以至于它似乎只不过是一位画家用指甲在天空上勾勒出来的草图，画家急于描绘这样一幅风景，如此纯粹的一幅作品“自然”这个小小的艺术符号，这个人类存在的单一标志。当人们走近它，可以辨认出方塔的残骸时，它的一半已成废墟，它仍然矗立在它的旁边，尽管在高度上无法与它相媲美，但首先，人们被它的色调所震惊，微红而阴沉，它的石头；在秋天的一个有雾的早晨，如果有人看到它升起在葡萄园的紫罗兰雷雨云之上，人们会称它为紫色的废墟，几乎是野葡萄藤的颜色。

Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with an angler’s immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love—and deem rich in beneficent influences—nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt’s gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:
在广场上，当我们回家时，祖母常常让我停下来抬头看看。从塔楼的窗户上，两两，一对在另一对上，它们的间距具有正确和原始的比例，不仅人类的面孔归功于它们的美丽和尊严，它释放了寒鸦，它每隔一段时间就飞落下来，过了一小会儿，它们就会转动、发出嘎嘎声，仿佛那些古老的石头让它们如此运动，却似乎从未见过它们，突然变得不适合居住，释放出某种无限令人不安的元素，击中了它们，将它们赶了出去。然后，在傍晚的空气中紫罗兰色的天鹅绒般的图案遍布各处之后，突然平静下来，它们会返回并被吸收在塔中，不再是致命的，而是仁慈的，一些栖息在这里和那里（似乎没有移动，但可能会折断，并吞下一些）飞过的昆虫）停在炮塔尖上，就像一只海鸥以钓鱼者的姿势静止在波峰上。不知道为什么，我的祖母在圣伊莱尔的尖塔中发现，那里没有粗俗、自命不凡和卑鄙，这使她热爱自然本身，并认为它充满了仁慈的影响，而当时人类的手还没有像我的手一样。姑婆的园丁，修剪它，天才的作品。当然，人们所看到的教堂的每个部分都通过一种弥漫在教堂中的普遍感觉来将整体与任何其他建筑区分开来，但正是在尖塔上，教堂似乎展示了一种自身意识，以肯定其个体和地位。负责任的存在。这是教堂的尖塔。 我还认为，我的祖母以一种困惑的方式在贡布雷的尖塔上发现了她最珍视的东西，那就是自然的空气和独特的空气。 对建筑一无所知的她会说：

‘My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it could play the piano, I am sure it would really play.’ And when she gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.
“亲爱的，如果你愿意的话，可以嘲笑我；它并不像传统意义上的美丽，但它那古色古香的古老面孔中有一些让我高兴的东西。如果它会弹钢琴，我相信它真的会弹。”当她凝视它时，当她的目光追随着那温柔的张力，当它们升起时，它的石坡热切地倾斜在一起，就像双手合十祈祷一样她会全神贯注地沉浸在尖塔的倾泻中，她的目光似乎也随之向上跳跃；与此同时，她的嘴唇弯起，对那些破旧的石头露出友善的微笑，夕阳现在只照亮了这些石头的最高点，当它们进入阳光的区域并被它软化和甜蜜时，似乎突然变得更高，变得真正遥远，就像一首歌的歌手突然用假声，比伴奏的空气高出一个八度。

It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I would say to myself: ‘Good heavens! nine o’clock! I must get ready for mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt Léonie first,’ and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise, cunning, and success.
圣伊莱尔的尖塔塑造、加冕并神圣化了镇上的每一种职业、每时每刻、每一个观点。从我卧室的窗户上，我只能看到它的底座，它刚刚被石板覆盖；但当周日我看到这些在夏日早晨的炽热阳光下，像黑色的太阳一样闪耀时，我会对自己说：‘天哪！九点钟！如果我想有时间进去亲吻莱奥妮姨妈，我必须立即准备好弥撒，”我会确切地知道广场上阳光的颜色，我能感觉到市场的热量和灰尘商店百叶窗后面的阴影，妈妈也许会在去弥撒的路上走进去，穿过未漂白的印花布的气味，去买一块手帕或什么东西，布艺师本人会让她看看他有什么，从那里鞠躬腰部：他已经做好了闭嘴的一切准备，刚刚走进后店穿上周日外套并洗手，这是他的习惯，每隔几分钟，甚至在最悲伤的时候，也要擦一擦。一个人以进取、狡猾和成功的姿态与另一个人对抗。

And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Théodore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of ‘holy bread,’ with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet cushion, against—as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words.
弥撒结束后，当我们进去告诉西奥多带一块比平时更大的面包时，因为我们的表兄弟趁着好天气从蒂伯齐过来吃午饭，我们面前有一座尖塔，它被烘烤了。棕色的身体就像一块更大的“圣面包”，上面沾满了阳光的薄片和粘稠的水滴，它的锋利的尖端刺入了蓝天。晚上，当我散步回来，想到即将到来的时刻，我必须向母亲道晚安，再也见不到她时，相比之下，在日暮时分，尖塔显得如此亲切，以至于我会想象它就像一个棕色天鹅绒垫子一样，被推入苍白的天空中，天空在其压力下屈服，稍微下沉，以便为它腾出空间，并相应地从两侧升起；而鸟儿在它周围飞来飞去的叫声似乎加剧了它的寂静，进一步拉长了它的尖顶，并赋予它某种超越言语力量的品质。

Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest ‘prints’ which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o’clock when going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one’s eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is ‘putting me on the right road’ shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart...
即使我们的任务是在教堂后面的地方，从那里看不到教堂，景色似乎总是参考尖塔来构图，尖塔会竖立在房屋之间，时而在这里，时而那里，并且是当它在没有教堂的情况下出现时，也许更感人。事实上，还有许多其他的东西以这种方式看起来最好，我可以想起屋顶上的小插曲，上面有尖塔，这与贡布雷沉闷的街道所形成的艺术完全不同。我永远不会忘记，在离巴尔贝克不远的一个古色古香的诺曼小镇上，有两座迷人的十八世纪的房子，对我来说很珍贵，而且由于多种原因而令人尊敬，当人们从一座美丽的花园抬头望去时，花园里有梯田，一直延伸到山上。河边，一座教堂的哥特式尖顶（本身隐藏在房屋之中）高耸入云，为教堂的正面加冕并完善，但其材质却如此不同，如此珍贵，如此有光泽，如此玫瑰色，如此抛光，以至于它立刻就被认为不再是它们的一部分，就像是并排躺着的两颗漂亮卵石的一部分一样，它是在海滩上被冲刷过的，紫色的、有皱纹的尖顶贝壳旋转成一个炮塔和同性恋有光泽的颜色。即使在巴黎，在城里最丑陋的地方之一，我也知道有一扇窗户，从那里人们可以看到第一层、第二层、甚至第三层杂乱的屋顶、街道与街道、紫罗兰色的钟声，有时是红色的，有时，也有大气所造成的最精美的“印记”，是一种灰色的黑色溶液；事实上，它只不过是圣奥古斯丁的圆顶，它赋予了巴黎的这种观点一些皮拉内西的罗马观点的特征。 但是，由于在这些小蚀刻中，无论我的记忆能够给它们的执行带来什么味道，它是否能够贡献出我早已失去的元素，这种感觉使我们不仅将事物视为奇观，但我相信它就像相信一个无与伦比的生物一样，所以他们中没有一个人在我内心深处的整个生活中依赖它，就像教堂后面街道上贡布雷尖塔的那些方面的记忆一样。是否有人在五点钟去邮局取信时看到过它，距左侧的一扇门有几扇门，它的孤立的山峰突然升起屋顶的山脊；或者再一次，当人们不得不进去询问夫人的消息时。萨泽拉特，人们的目光追随着那条线，它再次延伸到更远的下降斜坡之外，人们知道这将是尖塔之后的第二个转弯；或者再一次，如果再往远处走，人们就会到达车站，人们会倾斜地看到它，在轮廓上显示出新的角度和表面，就像一个固体在其旋转中的某个未知点上感到惊讶；或者，从维冯纳河畔，后殿，肌肉发达地聚集在一起，透视效果更高，似乎随着尖塔的努力而向上弹起，将其尖顶抛向天堂的中心：它总是指向尖塔人们必须回来，它总是主宰其他一切，用意想不到的尖峰总结房屋，像上帝的手指一样在我面前举起，他的身体可能隐藏在下面的人群中，而不用担心我混淆它，因为这个原因，和他们在一起。 因此，即使在今天，在任何一个大城市，或者在巴黎的一个我不太熟悉的地方，如果一个“引导我走上正确的道路”的路人从远处给我指路，作为一个目标点在我要走的街道拐角处，某家医院的钟楼，或者一座修道院的尖塔，高举着教堂的帽子，我的记忆只需要在其中找到与那个亲爱的、消失的轮廓有一些模糊的相似之处，和路人如果回头看看我没有迷路，他会惊讶地看到我，忘记了我计划要走的路，也忘记了我不得不去的地方，一动不动地站在路边。在那座尖塔前，连续几个小时一动不动，试图回忆，内心深处感觉自己是一块从忘川水中回收的土壤，慢慢干燥，直到建筑物再次在上面升起；然后毫无疑问，然后比刚才更不安，我向他问了方向，我会再次寻找我的路，我会转过弯……但是……目标就在我心里……

On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray between Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation profits. More ‘literary’ than many ‘men of letters’ (we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we had never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavallière neckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy, at fashionable life, and ‘snobbishness’—‘undoubtedly,’ he would say, ‘the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness.’
在做完弥撒回家的路上，我们经常会遇到勒格朗丹先生，他因工程师的职业职责而被困在巴黎，只能在周六晚上和周一早上之间去贡布雷（除了正常假期）他的家。他是这样一类人中的一员，他们除了可能在科学事业上取得了辉煌的成功外，还获得了一种完全不同的文化、文学或艺术文化，而他们在自己的专业工作中并没有利用这些文化。职业，但他们的谈话从中受益。比许多“文学家”更有“文学性”（当时我们并不知道勒格朗丹先生作为作家享有独特的声誉，因此非常惊讶地发现一位著名作曲家将他的一些诗句写在了他的作品中）他们比许多画家更容易执行，他们想象自己被迫过的生活并不是他们真正适合的生活，他们给自己的日常工作带来了要么是一种奇妙的冷漠，要么是一种持续而持久的生活。崇高的应用，蔑视，苦涩，认真。个子高，身材好，一张精致而深思熟虑的脸，下垂的白胡子，蓝眼睛里流露出幻灭的神情，彬彬有礼得近乎夸张；一个我们从未听过的健谈者；在我的家人眼中，他一直以他为榜样，他是一位绅士的典范，他以最高尚、最精致的方式对待生活。只有我的祖母才批评他说得太好，有点太像书本了，没有使用像他松散的拉瓦利埃领带和他短而直的、几乎是学生气的外套那样自然的词汇。 她也对他总是对贵族、时尚生活和“势利”发起猛烈的谩骂感到惊讶——“毫无疑问，”他会说，“圣保罗在谈到贵族时所想到的罪恶。”罪不可赦免。’

Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not having guillotined them all.
世俗的野心是我祖母无法感受或理解的东西，在她看来，对其进行如此强烈的谴责似乎是徒劳的。此外，她认为勒格朗丹先生的品味不太好，他的妹妹嫁给了巴尔贝克附近下诺曼底的一位乡村绅士，他竟然对贵族进行如此暴力的攻击，甚至指责革命不应该这样做。把他们全部送上断头台。

‘Well met, my friends!’ he would say as he came towards us. ‘You are lucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to squeeze back into my niche.
“很高兴见到你，我的朋友们！”他向我们走来时会说。 ‘你很幸运能在这里度过这么多时间；明天我必须回到巴黎，重新回到我的位置。

‘Oh, I admit,’ he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical, disillusioned and vague, ‘I have every useless thing in the world in my house there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch of open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life, little boy,’ he added, turning to me. ‘You have a soul in you of rare quality, an artist’s nature; never let it starve for lack of what it needs.’
“哦，我承认，”他带着他特有的微笑继续说道，带着温和的讽刺、幻灭和含糊，“我的房子里有世界上所有无用的东西。唯一想要的就是必要的东西，像这样一大片开阔的天空。永远努力在你的生活之上保留一片天空，小男孩，”他转向我补充道。 “你有一颗罕见的灵魂，一个艺术家的天性；永远不要让它因为缺乏所需的东西而挨饿。

When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme. Goupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her. Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Françoise was at once dispatched to the grocer’s, but returned empty-handed owing to the absence of Théodore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer’s assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs.
当我们到达家时，我的姨妈会派人来问我们是否夫人。古皮尔参加弥撒确实迟到了，我们没有人能通知她。相反，我们告诉她教堂里有一位画家正在临摹坏人吉尔伯特的窗户，这增加了她的焦虑。弗朗索瓦丝立即被派往杂货店，但由于西奥多不在，他空手而归。 西奥多的双重职业是唱诗班成员（负责织物的维护）和杂货店的助手，这使他不仅与所有部门都有关系。社会，而是对其事务的百科全书式了解。

‘Ah!’ my aunt would sigh, ‘I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She is really the only person who will be able to tell me.’
“啊！”我姨妈会叹息道，“我希望尤拉莉是时候来了。”她确实是唯一能够告诉我的人。

Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had ‘retired’ after the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Théodore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt Léonie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Curé’s linen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt Léonie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor’s name from her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought, in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation and at Franchise’s urgent request, and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid: ‘Don’t you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?’ or who, on the other hand, when she said to them: ‘I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!’ had replied: ‘Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may last a while yet”; each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again. And if Françoise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt’s face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt’s devices (which never failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.
尤拉莉是一位跛行、精力充沛、聋哑的老处女，在夫人去世后“退休”了。她从小就和德拉·布勒托内里一起服务，然后在教堂旁边租了一个房间，她不断地从那里出来，要么参加一些仪式，要么在没有仪式的时候祈祷独自一人或向西奥多伸出援手；其余的时间她都去探望像莱奥妮姨妈这样的病人，她会向他们讲述弥撒或晚祷时发生的一切。她不遗余力地在微薄的收入中添加一些零花钱，这些收入是她以前雇主的家人为她找到的，时不时地去照看神甫的亚麻布，或者其他一些在文书界有名气的人的亚麻布。贡布雷。在黑布斗篷外面，她戴着一顶白色小头巾，这似乎几乎让她依附于某个教团，皮肤的虚弱使她的部分脸颊和弯曲的鼻子染上了香脂般的鲜红色。她的来访是莱奥妮姨妈生活中最大的干扰，她现在除了牧师库雷之外几乎见不到任何人。我姨妈逐渐从她的名单上删除了所有其他访客的名字，因为在她看来，他们都犯了致命的错误，落入了她最讨厌的两类人中的一类或另一类。一组是两组中最差的一组，也是她首先摆脱的一组，其中包括那些建议她不要太照顾自己的人，并进行说教（即使只是消极的，除了偶尔不赞成之外没有任何外在迹象）沉默或怀疑的微笑）颠覆性的教条是，在阳光下快速散步和一块上好的红牛排会对她更有好处（她已经在肚子上喝了两口可怕的维希水十四个小时了！）比她所有的药瓶和她的床还要多。另一类人似乎相信她的病比她想象的更严重，事实上她的病正如她所说的那样严重。因此，在弗朗西斯的紧急要求下，经过相当长的犹豫之后，她才允许上楼进入她的房间，而那些在访问过程中表现出自己是多么不值得通过胆怯而获得的荣誉的人： “你不认为如果你只是在真正美好的日子里出去活动一下吗……？”或者，另一方面，当她对他们说：“我非常低落，非常低落；我非常低落，非常低落；”快结束了，亲爱的朋友们！”回答道：“啊，是的，当一个人没有力气的时候！不过，你还可以坚持一段时间”；双方都可能确信她的大门永远不会再向他们敞开。如果弗朗索瓦丝对我姨妈脸上惊愕的表情感到好笑，每当她在床上看到圣埃斯普利街的这些人，他们看起来好像是来看她的，或者听到她自己的门声铃声一响，她会笑得更开心，就像嘲笑一个聪明的把戏，嘲笑我姨妈把他们送走的装置（从来没有失败过），嘲笑他们在看不到她而不得不折返时的狼狈表情。她会对她的女主人充满秘密的钦佩，她觉得女主人比所有其他人都优越，因为她可以而且确实设法不去见他们。总之，姨妈同时规定，无论谁来探望她，都必须赞同她的生活方式，同情她所受的痛苦，并保证她最终康复。

In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute: ‘The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!’, twenty times Eulalie would retort with: ‘Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.’ For one of Eulalie’s most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat’s name was really Mme. Sazerin.
在这一切方面，尤拉莉都表现出色。我姨妈可能会在一分钟内对她说二十次：“末日终于来了，我可怜的尤拉莉！”二十次，尤拉莉会反驳道：“像你一样了解自己的病情，夫人。”奥克塔夫，你会活到一百岁，就像奥克塔夫女士一样。萨泽林昨天才对我说。”对于尤拉莉最根深蒂固的信念之一，以及她的经验必须整理出的一系列令人畏惧的更正清单，是无力根除的，那就是夫人。萨泽拉特的名字确实是夫人。萨泽林。

‘I do not ask to live to a hundred,’ my aunt would say, for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.
“我不要求活到一百岁，”我姨妈会说，因为她更喜欢对自己的天数没有明确的限制。

And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn. Eulalie’s ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go upstairs to ‘occupy’ my aunt. But—and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray—the proud hour °f noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table, beside the ‘holy bread,’ which too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add—as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill, because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to ‘settle down’ in the seven hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf, because it was our turn to ‘offer’ the holy bread. And when all these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an ‘occasional piece’ of music, into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: ‘No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,’ would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value is the creator’s intention and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the ‘piece’ was still being played, and under the composer’s-very eyes.
除此之外，尤拉莉知道如何分散我姨妈的注意力而不让她劳累，所以她每周日都会定期来访，除非发生不可预见的事情阻止他们，这对我姨妈来说是一种愉快的前景。这让她在那些日子里一直处于一种期待的状态，一开始就很开胃，但如果尤拉莉迟到一分钟，她就会立刻变成饥饿太久而得不到满足的痛苦。因为，如果时间过长，等待尤拉莉的狂喜就会变成一种折磨，而我姨妈会不停地看时间、打哈欠、轮流抱怨她的每一种症状。尤拉莉的铃声，如果在一天结束时，当她不再期待的时候从前门响起，几乎会让她生病。事实上，周日她只想着这次拜访，而我们的午餐一结束，弗朗索瓦丝就会不耐烦地让我们离开餐厅，以便她可以上楼去“占领”我的姨妈。但是——从贡布雷肯定天气晴朗的那一天起，这一点比以往任何时候都更强烈——正午那令人骄傲的时刻，从圣伊莱尔的尖塔上下来，它用响亮的王冠上的十二个点标记了一会儿，很长时间以来，我们的餐桌上都回响着“神圣的面包”，而“神圣的面包”也是在教堂之后以熟悉的方式进来的。我们仍然会坐在天方夜谭的盘子前，因为白天的炎热而感到沉重，甚至因为我们的大餐而感到沉重。 因为在鸡蛋、炸肉排、土豆、蜜饯和饼干的永久基础上，她不再向我们宣布它们出现在餐桌上，弗朗索瓦丝会添加——田地和果园的劳动，潮汐的收获，人们的运气。市场、邻居的​​友善以及她自己的天才可能会提供；我们的菜单如此有效，就像十三世纪大教堂门廊上雕刻的四叶形一样，在某种程度上反映了季节的变化和人类生活的事件——这真是太棒了，因为鱼女保证其新鲜度；一只火鸡，因为她在鲁桑维尔勒潘的市场上看到了一位美女；带有骨髓的菜蓟，因为她以前从未以这种方式为我们做过。烤羊腿，因为新鲜的空气让人产生饥饿感，晚餐前七个小时有足够的时间“安定下来”；菠菜，通过改变；杏子，因为它们仍然很难买到；醋栗，因为再过两周就没有了；覆盆子，是斯万先生特意带来的；樱桃，是樱桃树上最先结出的樱桃，而这棵樱桃树在过去的两年里没有结果。奶油奶酪，当时我非常喜欢它；杏仁蛋糕，因为她前一天晚上订了一个；一个精美的面包，因为轮到我们“提供”圣面包了。当所有这些都吃完后，一件专门为我们自己创作的作品，但更特别地献给我的父亲，他喜欢这样的东西，一种由弗朗索瓦丝之手创作的、灵感来自心灵的巧克力奶油，将是摆在我们面前，轻盈而转瞬即逝，就像一首“偶然的”音乐，她倾注了全部的才华。 任何拒绝参加的人都会说：‘不，谢谢，我已经吃完了；我不饿”，这会立即被降低到非利士人的水平，当艺术家将他的一件作品作为礼物送给他们时，他们会检查它的重量和材料，而有价值的是创作者的意图和他的作品。签名。即使在盘子里留下哪怕是最微小的一点，也会表现出无礼的行为，就像当“作品”还在演奏、在作曲家的眼前起身离开音乐厅一样。

At length my mother would say to me: ‘Now, don’t stay here all day; you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh air first; don’t start reading immediately after your food.’
最后，我母亲会对我说：‘现在，别整天待在这里；如果外面太热，你可以到自己的房间去，但先呼吸一下新鲜空气；不要在吃完饭后立即开始阅读。

And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender, allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building, my aunt’s back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled floor gleaming like por-phyry. It seemed not so much the cave of Françoise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove.
我会走到泵和它的水槽旁边坐下，那里到处装饰着一只蝾螈，就像哥特式字体一样，它以破碎的石头为背景，迅速浮现出它修长的、寓言般的身体；在没有靠背的长凳上，在紫丁香树的树荫下，在花园的那个小角落里，通过一扇服务门与圣埃斯皮里街相通，从那里被忽视的土壤分两个阶段升起，房子本身的露头，显然是一栋独立的建筑，我姨妈的后厨房。人们可以看到它的红色瓷砖地板像斑岩一样闪闪发光。与其说它是弗朗索瓦丝的洞穴，不如说它是一座维纳斯的小神庙。那里摆满了送奶工、果农、蔬菜水果商的贡品，他们有时从遥远的村庄赶来，将自家田地里初熟的果实奉献给这里。它的屋顶上总是传来鸽子的咕咕声。

In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle Adolphe’s room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents’, only yellow; then we would enter what he called his ‘study,’ a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: ‘A quarter past two,’ which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing them: ‘A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him....’
早些时候，我不会在这座寺庙周围的神圣树林里逗留，因为，在上楼读书之前，我会偷偷溜进我叔叔阿道夫的小起居室，他是我祖父的兄弟，也是一名老战士，作为一名少校退役后，他曾经住在一楼的一个房间里，即使窗户开着，热量也能进入，即使不是实际上很少穿透的阳光，也永远不会不散发出热量。模糊而新鲜的气味，立刻让人联想到一种露天和老式的存在，当你走进一间废弃的枪房时，它会让鼻孔一直在做梦。但现在我已经好几年没有去过叔叔阿道夫的房间了，因为他不再来贡布雷了，因为他和我的家人之间发生了争吵，这是我的过失，而且是在以下情况下：每年一两次一个月，在巴黎，我被派去付钱给他了。当他吃完午饭时，他穿着一件朴素的羊驼毛大衣，穿着一件紫色和白色条纹亚麻工作服的仆人在侍候着他。 他会抱怨我好久没来看他了；他被忽视了；他会给我一块玛克板或一个橘子，我们会穿过一间从来没有人坐过的房间，里面从来没有生过火，墙壁上镶着镀金的装饰线条，天花板漆成蓝色以模仿天空，房间里的灯也亮了起来。家具是用缎子软垫的，和我祖父母的一样，只是黄色；然后我们会进入他所谓的“书房”，房间的墙上挂满了版画，在黑暗的背景下，画着一位丰满、红润的女神，她驾驶着一辆汽车，或者站在地球仪上，或者额头上戴着一颗星星;这些画在第二帝国时期很受欢迎，因为人们认为这些画中有一些让人联想到庞贝城的东西，当时人们普遍鄙视这些画，现在人们出于一个单一且一致的原因再次开始收集这些画（尽管他们可能提出其他任何理由） ），即他们建议第二帝国。我会在那里和叔叔呆在一起，直到他的人带着马车夫的口信过来，问他什么时候需要马车。然后我叔叔就会陷入沉思，而他的仆人则惊讶地站在那里，不敢有任何动作打扰他，好奇地等待着他的答案，而他的答案却始终没有改变。因为最后，在极度的犹豫之后，我叔叔会准确无误地说出这句话：“两点一刻”，仆人会惊讶地附和，但没有争论：“两点一刻！”很好，先生……我去告诉他……’

At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually.
在这一天，我是一个戏剧爱好者：一个柏拉图式的爱好者，这是必然的，因为我的父母还不允许我进入剧院，而我为自己描绘的在那里享受乐趣的画面是如此不正确，以至于我几乎相信每个观众都像进入立体镜一样，看到一个只为他自己而存在的舞台和风景，尽管与单独呈现给其他观众的上千个其他奇观非常相似。

Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such strange titles as the Testament de César Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi, inscribed not on the green bills of the Opéra-Comique, but on the wine-coloured bills of the Comédie-Française, nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de la Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir; and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice à l’Impératrice and the famous cream of chocolate.
每天早上我都会赶到莫里斯专栏看看它宣布了哪些新剧。没有什么比这些公告在我脑海中充满的梦想更无私或更快乐的了，这些梦想的形式来自于构成戏剧标题的单词不可避免的联想，也来自于仍然潮湿和皱巴巴的钞票的颜色上面有浆糊，这些字在上面很突出。没有什么，除了像《塞萨尔·吉罗多遗嘱》或《俄狄浦斯王》这样奇怪的标题，不是刻在喜歌剧院的绿色钞票上，而是刻在法兰西喜剧院的酒红色钞票上，在我看来，没有什么是可以理解的。与 Diamants de la Couronne 的闪闪发光的白色羽毛相比，与 Domino Noir 光滑、神秘的缎面的区别更大；由于我的父母告诉我，如果我第一次去剧院，我必须在这两部作品中做出选择，所以我会详尽地研究一个的标题和另一个的标题（因为这些都是我想要的）我知道其中任何一个），试图从每个人身上抢占它所提供给我的快乐的预尝，并将这种快乐与另一个标题中潜在的快乐进行比较，直到最后我向自己展示了如此生动，如此引人注目的画面，一方面，这是一部令人眼花缭乱的傲慢剧，另一方面，又是一部温柔、柔软的剧，我几乎无法决定我应该更喜欢看哪一部剧，就好像在餐桌上，他们强迫我看一样。可选择米饭 à l'Impératrice 和著名的巧克力奶油。

All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art, although as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment. Between one actor’s tricks of intonation and inflection and another’s, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.
我和我的剧友的所有对话都与演员有关，尽管我还没有体验过他们的艺术，但他们的艺术是其无数形式中的第一个，在这些形式中，艺术本身让我能够预见到它的乐趣。在一个演员的语调和语调变化技巧与另一个演员之间，最细微的差别都会让我觉得具有不可估量的重要性。根据我对他们的了解，我会按照他们的才能将他们排列在列表中，我常常整天对自己嘀咕：这些列表最终在我的大脑中变得石化，并成为我烦恼的根源。 ，不可移动。

And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the master’s head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second Delaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and blossoming life.
后来，在我的学生时代，每当我在课堂上冒险时，当老师转过头来与新朋友交流时，我总是先问他是否已经开始去剧院，如果他同意我们的最伟大的演员无疑是戈特，我们的第二德劳内，等等。如果按照他的判断，费弗尔排在蒂隆之下，或者德劳奈排在科克兰之下，那么科克兰这个名字，放弃了它僵硬的僵化，就会在我的脑海中产生突然的波动，在这种波动中，它上升到第二位，丰富的生命力德劳内的名字会突然出现，使其滑落到第四位，这会刺激我的大脑，让我的大脑充满一种生命力旺盛的感觉。

But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant, coming out one afternoon from the Théâtre-Français, had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a ‘star,’ blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life.
但是，如果演员的想法如此沉重地压在我身上，如果一天下午从法兰西剧院出来的莫邦特的景象让我陷入了无望爱情的阵痛和痛苦中，那么“明星”的名字更重要吗？ ” 剧院的门外熊熊燃烧，更何况，透过一辆马车的窗户看到，这辆马车在街上经过我，前额上的头发绽放着玫瑰花，我想，她的脸也许是一位女演员，给我留下了持久的困扰，徒劳而痛苦的努力来描绘她的私生活。

I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who had perhaps never been married) and countesses (whose high-sounding titles were probably no more than noms de guerre) the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother: ‘One of your uncle’s friends,’ and I would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend.
我按照才华的顺序将最杰出的人分类为：莎拉·伯恩哈特（Sarah Bernhardt）、贝尔玛（Berma）、巴特特（Bartet）、玛德琳·布罗汉（Madeleine Brohan）、珍妮·萨玛丽（Jeanne Samary）；但我对它们都很感兴趣。现在，我叔叔认识其中许多人，还有其他阶层的女士，在我看来，这些女士与女演员没有明显的区别。他常常在他家里招待他们。如果我们只在某些日子去看他，那是因为在其他日子里，女士们可能会来，而他的家人不太可能见到他。所以我们至少认为；至于我的叔叔，他致命地愿意向漂亮的寡妇（她们可能从未结过婚）和伯爵夫人（她们的冠冕堂皇的头衔可能只不过是战争名义）表示恭维，将她们介绍给我的祖母，甚至介绍给我的祖母。这些是我们家的一些珠宝，已经不止一次地让他和我祖父卷入了纠纷。通常，如果在谈话中提到某个女演员的名字，我会听到父亲微笑着对母亲说：“你叔叔的一个朋友。”我会想起那个疲惫的见习生，也许多年来最后，一个成年男子，甚至是一个真正重要的男人，可能不得不经过，在某个这样的女士的门口等待，而她拒绝回他的信，并让门厅把他赶走；想象一下，我叔叔把我介绍给他家里的那位女演员，让像我这样的小家伙摆脱了所有这些痛苦，这位女演员是全世界都无法接近的，但对他来说却是一位亲密的朋友。

And so—on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been altered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my uncle—one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with red carnations on the horses’ blinkers and in the coachman’s buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman’s voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: ‘Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother (your niece, isn’t she?) beside it? The image of her, isn’t he? I should so like to see the little chap, just for a second.’
于是——借口是某堂课的时间已经改变，现在在一个如此尴尬的时刻到来，以至于它已经不止一次地阻止我，并将继续阻止我见到我的叔叔——有一天，在他为我们拜访而安排的日子里，我没有利用父母比平常更早吃午饭的机会。我溜出去，没有去读他们专栏上的节目单，为此我被允许独自外出，而是一路跑到他家。我注意到他的门前停着一辆马车，马眼罩上和车夫的扣眼上都插着红色康乃馨。当我爬上楼梯时，我听到笑声和女人的声音，我一按铃，就听到了寂静和关门的声音。让我进去的男仆显得很尴尬，说我叔叔很忙，可能见不到我；然而，他进去宣布我的到来，而我之前听到的同一个声音说：“哦，是的！”让他进来吧；就一会儿；这会很有趣。你桌上那张照片是他的吗？他的母亲（你的侄女，不是吗？）在旁边吗？她的形象，不是吗？我很想见见这个小家伙，哪怕只是一会儿。”

I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant told me to come in.
我听见叔叔在抱怨，而且越来越生气。最后男仆叫我进来。

On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my uncle wore the same alapca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and smiled; my uncle said ‘My nephew!’ without telling her my name or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance.
桌子上放的是一直放在那里的同一盘马赛克玻璃。我叔叔和其他日子一样穿着羊驼毛外套。但他对面坐着一位年轻女子，她身穿粉红色丝质连衣裙，脖子上挂着一条大珍珠项链，她刚刚吃完一个橘子。我不确定是否应该称呼她为“夫人”或“小姐”，这让我脸红了，不敢过多地看她的方向，以免我不得不和她说话，我赶紧过去亲吻我的叔叔。她看着我，微笑着；我叔叔说“我的侄子！”，但没有告诉她我的名字，也没有告诉我她的名字，这无疑是因为，自从他与祖父发生矛盾以来，他一直尽力避免他的家人与其他熟人有任何联系。

‘How like his mother he is,’ said the lady.
“他多么像他的母亲啊，”那位女士说。

‘But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,’ my uncle broke in quickly, with a note of anger.
“但是除了照片之外，你从来没有见过我的侄女，”我叔叔很快插话道，语气里带着愤怒。

‘I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your staircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was. This young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,’ she went on, tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead. ‘Tell me,’ she asked my uncle, ‘is your niece Mme.——; is her name the same as yours?’
“请原谅，亲爱的朋友，去年你病得很重的时候，我在楼梯上从她身边经过。确实，我只见过她一会儿，而且你的楼梯很暗；但我看得很清楚，看出她是多么可爱。这位年轻的绅士有一双美丽的眼睛，还有这个，”她继续说道，用一根手指在额头下方画了一条线。 “告诉我，”她问我叔叔，“你的侄女女士是——；她的名字和你的名字一样吗？

‘He takes most after his father,’ muttered my uncle, who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma’s name aloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. ‘He’s his father all over, and also like my poor mother.’
“他最像他的父亲。”我舅舅嘀咕道，他并不急于通过代理进行介绍，大声重复妈妈的名字，而是想让两个人真正走到一起。 “他完全就是他的父亲，也像我可怜的母亲。”

‘I have not met his father, dear,’ said the lady in pink, bowing her head slightly, ‘and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another.’
“我没有见过他的父亲，亲爱的，”粉衣女士微微低着头说道，“我也从未见过你可怜的母亲。你会记得，正是在你经历了巨大的悲伤之后，我们才认识了彼此。”

I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home, especially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every New Year’s Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle’s friend had the same quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner. I could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in photographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in believing that this was one of ‘those women,’ and certainly I should never have believed her one of the ‘smart ones’ had I not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who was no longer of a family at all.
我感到有些失望，因为这位年轻女士与我在家里时不时见到的其他漂亮女人没有任何不同，尤其是我们一个表姐妹的女儿，我每年元旦都会去她家。只有穿得更好；除此之外，我叔叔的朋友也有同样敏捷而友善的目光，同样坦率而友好的态度。我在她身上找不到任何我在女演员照片中所欣赏的戏剧性外表的痕迹，也找不到与她必须过的生活相符的恶魔般的表情。我很难相信这是“那些女人”中的一个，当然，如果我没有看到那辆马车和一双、粉红色的裙子、珍珠项链，我绝对不会相信她是“聪明的女人”之一。我也意识到我叔叔只知道他们中最优秀的人。但我问自己，这位给了她马车、公寓和珠宝的百万富翁怎么能在把钱花在一个外表如此朴素、受人尊敬的女人身上找到乐趣呢？然而，当我想到她的生活一定是什么样子时，它的不道德行为也许比它以某种具体的、可识别的形式站在我面前更让我不安，因为它的秘密和隐形，就像小说的情节一样，一个丑闻的隐藏真相，这个丑闻被赶出了她的中产阶级父母的家，并致力于为全人类服务，这使她的美丽达到了巅峰，使这个女人名声大噪或臭名昭著，她的容貌、声音的语调，就像我已经认识的许多其他人一样，让我不由自主地将她视为一位出身名门的年轻女士，而她根本不再是一个家庭的人。

We had gone by this time into the ‘study,’ and my uncle, who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.
这时我们已经进入“书房”了，我的叔叔似乎对我的存在感到有点尴尬，递给她一支香烟。

‘No, thank you, dear friend,’ she said. ‘You know I only smoke the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.’ And she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a foreign language. ‘Why, yes,’ she began again suddenly. ‘Of course I have met this young man’s father with you. Isn’t he your nephew? How on earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,’ she went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming), I, who knew my father’s coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality. It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up delicately, given it a ‘turn,’ a precious title, set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming.
“不，谢谢你，亲爱的朋友，”她说。 “你知道我只抽大公送我的烟。我告诉他，它们会让你嫉妒。”然后她从盒子里抽出香烟，上面刻着外语的金色铭文。 “啊，是的，”她突然又开口了。 ‘当然，我和你一起见过这个年轻人的父亲。他不是你的侄子吗？我到底怎么会忘记呢？他对我很好，很有魅力。”她谦虚而充满感情地继续说道。但当我心里想，这种粗鲁的问候实际上是什么（她说，这种问候是那么迷人）时，我，因为知道父亲的冷漠和矜持，感到震惊，仿佛对他的某些不礼貌行为感到震惊。过度的认可与他从未足够的和蔼可亲之间形成鲜明对比。从那以后，这些无所事事、辛勤工作的女性在生活中扮演的角色中最感人的方面之一给我留下了深刻的印象，她们奉献了所有的慷慨，所有的才华，以及她们对感伤之美的可转移的梦想（因为，像所有艺术家一样，她们从不努力实现这些梦想的价值，或者将它们封装在日常生活的四方形框架中），而他们的金子却毫无价值，为那些被摩擦、刮伤和生病的人塑造了一个精美而珍贵的环境。男人的精致生活。 正如这个人充满了吸烟室，我叔叔正在那里招待她穿着他的羊驼毛外套，她迷人的身材，她的粉红色丝绸连衣裙，她的珍珠，以及与大公的亲密关系所暗示的优雅，所以，在同样地，她接受了我父亲的一些漫不经心的评论，精心地对其进行了处理，给了它一个“转弯”，一个珍贵的头衔，在其中镶嵌了她自己眼睛里的一瞥的宝石，第一水的宝石，混合着谦卑和感恩；就这样，它被归还给他人，变成了一件珠宝、一件艺术品、一件完全迷人的东西。

‘Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,’ said my uncle.
“听着，我的孩子，你该离开了，”我叔叔说。

I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to myself ‘Shall I do it, shall I not?’ and then I ceased to ask myself what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.
我站起来;我几乎无法抗拒亲吻粉红女士的手的欲望，但我觉得这样做就像强行绑架她一样大胆。当我对自己数着“我该做还是不该做？”时，我的心剧烈跳动，然后我不再问自己应该做什么，至少要做某事。我盲目地、热切地、疯狂地把我刚刚找到的所有支持这种行动的理由抛在一边，抓住她向我伸出的手，举到唇边。

‘Isn’t he delicious! Quite a ladies’ man already; he takes after his uncle. He’ll be a perfect ‘gentleman,’’ she went on, setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. ‘Couldn’t he come to me some day for ‘a cup of tea,’ as our friends across the channel say; he need only send me a ‘blue’ in the morning?’
‘他不是很好吃吗！已经是个十足的女汉子了；他很像他叔叔。他会是一位完美的“绅士”，”她继续说道，咬紧牙关，让这个词有一种英国的重音。 “正如我们海峡对岸的朋友所说，有一天他就不能来找我‘喝杯茶’吗？”他只需要在早上给我发一张‘蓝色’就行了？”

I had not the least idea of what a ‘blue’ might be. I did not understand half the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was beginning to feel extremely tired.
我根本不知道“蓝色”是什么。我听不懂这位女士所说的一半话，但我担心其中隐藏着一些问题，如果我不回答的话，那就太不礼貌了，这让我无法从他们身上撤回我的密切关注，我开始感觉到极度疲劳。

‘No, no; it is impossible,’ said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. ‘He is kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all the prizes from his school,’ he added in a lower tone, so that I should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. ‘You can’t tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don’t you know.’
'不，不;这是不可能的。”叔叔耸耸肩说道。 “他整天在家里忙碌；他还有很多工作要做。他从学校带回了所有奖品。”他低声补充道，这样我就不会听到这个谎言并用矛盾打断。 ‘你说不出来；他可能会变得有点维克多雨果，一种沃拉贝尔，你不知道吗？

‘Oh, I love artistic people,’ replied the lady in pink; ‘there is no one like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like yourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.’
“哦，我喜欢有艺术气质的人。”粉衣女士回答道。 “没有人像他们一样了解女性。他们，还有像你这样非常好的男人。但请原谅我的无知。沃拉贝尔是谁、什么？是客厅小玻璃柜里那些镀金的书吗？你知道你答应过把它们借给我；我会好好照顾他们。

My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old uncle’s tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he, awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my uncle’s I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle’s conduct. My father and grandfather had ‘words’ with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage, Î felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered tha merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadéquate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I was obeying my parents’ orders; he never forgave them; and though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him again.
叔叔不喜欢借书，他什么也没说，把我领到了大厅里。我疯狂地爱着那个穿粉红衣服的女士，我用热情的吻覆盖了我老叔叔沾满烟草的脸颊，而他却很尴尬地让我明白（没有真正说出来）他宁愿我不要把这件事告诉我的父母我眼里含着泪水向他保证，他的善意给我留下了如此深刻的印象，有一天我一定会找到一种方式来表达我的感激之情。这给我留下了如此强烈的印象，以至于两个小时后，在一系列神秘的话语之后，我并没有让我的父母充分清楚地了解我被赋予的新重要性，我发现让他们更容易他们对我那天下午的访问有完整的记录，没有遗漏任何细节。我这样做并没有想过给叔叔带来任何不愉快。既然我不希望这样，我怎么会想到这样的事呢？我无法想象我的父母会在这次拜访中看到任何伤害，而我自己却没有看到任何伤害。在我们生活的每一天里，不会有某个朋友或其他人要求我们一定要向某个他无法写信的女人道歉；但是，我们却无法给他写信。难道我们没有忘记这样做吗，因为我们觉得这个女人不太重视我们自己没有的沉默？和其他人一样，我想象其他人的大脑是没有生命的、顺从的容器，对可能施加在他们身上的任何刺激没有特定反应的能力；我毫不怀疑，当我把在叔叔家相识的消息记在父母心里时，我应该同时向他们转达我自己根据介绍所做出的善意判断。 不幸的是，我父母在评估我叔叔的行为时所采用的原则与我建议他们采用的原则完全不同。我的父亲和祖父曾对他进行过暴力命令的“言语”；正如我间接了解到的。几天后，当我叔叔开着一辆敞篷马车在街上经过时，我立刻感受到了我本想向他传达的所有悲伤、感激和悔恨。除了这些巨大的情感之外，我认为仅仅向他脱帽是不协调和琐碎的，并且可能会让他认为我认为自己有义务向他展示只不过是最常见的礼貌形式。我决定放弃这种不恰当的举动，并把头转开。舅舅认为我这样做是听从了父母的吩咐；他从未原谅他们；尽管他直到许多年后才去世，但我们中没有人再见过他。

And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut) of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the back-kitchen until Françoise appeared on its threshold and an-nounced: ‘I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,’ I would then decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature, some way ‘gone’ in pregnancy when we arrived at Com-bray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Françoise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: ‘Well, how goes it with Giotto’s Charity?’ And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena beneath the label ‘Caritas,’ and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the painter’s invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to God, or shall we say ‘handing’ it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The ‘Invidia,’ again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child’s who is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious thoughts.
所以我不再去我叔叔阿道夫的小客厅（现在已经关着）；相反，在后厨房的外围徘徊，直到弗朗索瓦丝出现在门槛上并宣布：“我要让厨房女仆倒咖啡并接热水;我该去见夫人了。八度，”然后我会决定进屋，然后直接上楼到我的房间看书。厨房女仆是一个抽象的人格，一个永久的机构，一套不变的属性确保了在这个人格化身的一系列短暂的人类形状中的某种固定性、连续性和身份。因为连续两年我们都没有在那里找到同一个女孩。在我们吃了这么多芦笋的那一年，负责给芦笋穿衣服的厨房女仆是个可怜的病弱者，当我们到达康布雷过复活节时，她已经怀孕了，而且确实是这样。令人惊讶的是，弗朗索瓦丝允许她在城里跑这么多的差事，在家里做这么多的工作，因为她开始发现在她面前抬着这个神秘的棺材变得困难，棺材一天天变得越来越满，越来越大，其辉煌的轮廓可能是从她宽大的罩衫的褶皱中可以看出。最后这些让人想起乔托在他的画作中包裹一些寓言人物的斗篷，斯旺先生给了我这些画的照片。正是他指出了这种相似之处，当他询问厨房女仆时，他会说：“那么，乔托的慈善事业怎么样？”事实上，这个可怜的女孩，她的怀孕使她的每一部分都肿胀、粗壮，甚至到了她的脸，以及她脸颊垂直、方形的轮廓，确实明显地暗示了那些处女，如此坚强和男子气概，以至于看起来更像是主妇，在他们的美德在竞技场教堂中得到了化身。现在我发现帕多瓦的美德和恶习在另一个方面也与她相似。因为正如这个女孩的身材被她体内携带的附加符号放大了一样，她似乎并没有理解它的含义，也没有在她的面部表情中渲染出它的所有美丽和精神意义，但似乎带着它是一个普通且相当沉重的负担，因此，毫无疑问，这位身材魁梧的家庭主妇在竞技场上以“明爱”为标签，而我的墙上挂着她肖像的复制品，对此她的身份没有任何明显的怀疑。贡布雷的教室，体现了这种美德，因为任何慈善思想似乎都不可能在她粗俗而充满活力的脸上表达出来。通过画家巧妙的笔触，她将地球上所有的宝藏都翻倒在她的脚下，但就像她在压榨酒中踩葡萄以榨汁一样，或者更进一步，就好像她爬上了葡萄树一样。一堆麻袋，让自己举得更高；她正在向上帝伸出她燃烧的心，或者我们应该说“交给”他，就像厨师通过地下厨房的天窗将开瓶器递给某个打电话给她要的人一样从地面以上。 ‘英维迪亚’号，再一次，脸上应该露出嫉妒的表情。 但在这幅壁画中，这个符号也占据了如此大的位置，并以如此现实主义的方式表现出来。嫉妒嘴唇之间的蛇嘶嘶声如此巨大，完全充满了她张开的嘴巴，以至于她脸上的肌肉紧张扭曲，就像一个孩子用自己的呼吸填充气球，而嫉妒，我们就这一点而言，当我们看着她时，因为她和我们所有的注意力都集中在她嘴唇的动作上，所以我们几乎没有时间去产生嫉妒的想法。

Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures of Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that Charity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator’s instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed), but as real things, actually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more literal to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal, intestinal aspect, towards that ‘seamy side’ of death which is, as it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a difficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of Death?
尽管斯旺先生可能对乔托的这些人物表示钦佩，但过了很长一段时间，我才能够在我们的教室（挂着他给我带来的副本）看到没有慈善的慈善，嫉妒看起来就像是医学书中的盘子，说明舌头上的肿瘤对声门或悬雍垂的压迫，或者通过操作者的仪器的介绍，一位法官，他灰色而卑鄙的规则特征是非常典型的。与我过去在弥撒中看到的贡布雷某些善良、虔诚、略显枯萎的女士脸上的装饰一样，其中许多人早已加入了不公正的后备部队。但在后来的几年里，我明白了这些壁画的引人注目的陌生感和特殊的美感在于它们的象征在它们中所扮演的重要角色，而事实是这些壁画是被描绘的，而不是作为象征（因为象征的思想没有在任何地方表达出来） ），但作为真实的事物，实际感觉或物质处理，为它们的含义添加了更精确和更字面的东西，为它们所传授的教训添加了更具体和更引人注目的东西。即使是那个可怜的厨房女仆，我们的注意力也不是不断地被她肚子里装满的东西所吸引；她的肚子里装满了食物。同样地，在死亡的痛苦中，男人和女人的思想不也经常转向实际的、痛苦的、模糊的、内在的、肠道的方面，转向死亡的“阴暗的一面”吗？死亡实际上呈现给他们并迫使他们感受到的一面，这一面更像是一种沉重的负担、呼吸困难、毁灭性的干渴，而不是我们习惯于赋予死亡名称的抽象概念？

There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and Vices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of participation by a person’s soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime face of true goodness.
帕多瓦的那些美德和恶习一定有很强的现实性，因为在我看来，它们就像怀孕的女仆一样充满活力，而她本人的寓言性也丝毫不亚于它们。而且，很有可能，一个人的灵魂缺乏（或表面上缺乏）参与其自身特殊美德的重要标志，除了其美学意义之外，还有一种现实，即使不是严格意义上的心理上的，至少也可以称为面相上的。 。后来，在我的一生中，当我有机会遇到，例如在修道院里，真正的实际慈善的圣人例子时，他们通常有一种忙碌的、坚决的、不受干扰的、略带残酷的气氛。外科医生的脸上，人们在看到受苦受难的人类时看不出任何怜悯、温柔，也没有害怕伤害它，这张脸上缺乏温柔或同情，一张真正善良的崇高面孔。

Then while the kitchen-maid—who, all unawares, made the superior qualities of Françoise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth—took in coffee which (according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my feeling of the day’s brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Curé, by Camus (whom Françoise had assured that my aunt was not ‘resting’ and that he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies’ music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie—born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible.
然后，当厨房女仆——不知不觉中，让弗朗索瓦丝的卓越品质变得更加光彩夺目，就像错误通过对比的力量增强了真理的胜利——喝了咖啡，而咖啡（据妈妈说）仅此而已。比热水还热，然后把不温不热的热水送到我们的房间，我会躺在床上，手里拿着一本书，在我的房间里，我的房间因努力捍卫脆弱的、透明的凉爽而颤抖。午后的阳光，在几乎关闭的百叶窗后面，然而，阳光的反射却设法从它金色的翅膀上溜进来，在玻璃和木制品之间，在一个角落里，一动不动，就像一只停在花朵上的蝴蝶。 天色还不足以让我阅读，我对这一天的明亮和辉煌的感觉完全来自于加缪（弗朗索瓦丝向加缪保证我的姨妈没有“休息”）在楼下的拉库雷街的敲击。 ”，因此他可能会发出噪音），在一些旧包装箱上，除了灰尘之外，实际上不会飞扬任何东西，尽管它们的喧闹声，在伴随着炎热天气的共鸣气氛中，似乎散布着一场雨血红色的星星；还有那些为了我的利益而表演的苍蝇，在他们的小型音乐会上，就像夏天的室内乐一样；与人类音乐的气氛截然不同，如果你碰巧在一个晴朗的夏天听到它，你总会想起那个夏天，苍蝇的音乐通过一种更接近的方式与季节联系在一起，更重要的纽带——诞生于阳光明媚的日子，不是重生，而是与它们一起重生，包含着它们本质的东西，它不仅唤起了我们记忆中的它们的形象，而且给了我们保证，它们确实存在，它们是就在我们周围，可立即到达。

This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which (thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it) bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.
我的房间里这种昏暗的清新之感，对于街道的光天化日之下，就像影子对于阳光一样，也就是说，同样明亮，它在我的想象中呈现出夏天的整个全景，如果我出去的话，我的感觉是这样的。行走，只能断断续续地品味和享受；因此，这与我的休息状态非常和谐，这种状态（多亏了我书中所涉及的冒险经历，刚刚激发了它）就像一只手一动不动地停在流水中，激流的冲击和活力的活动和生活。

But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had broken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up and beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I would go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little sentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family.
但我的祖母，即使天气变得太热了，暴风雨，或者只是一场阵雨，在我们身上爆发，她也会过来求我出去。因为我不想放下我的书，所以我会在花园里的栗子树下，在一个用帆布和垫子搭建的小岗亭里继续看书，我常常坐在岗亭的最深处，感觉我被隐藏起来，看不到任何可能来拜访家人的人的眼睛。

And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange’s, whose grocery lay too far from our house for Françoise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts.
然后我的想法，难道它们不是形成了一个类似的藏身之处，在它的深处，我觉得我可以把自己埋进去，即使我在看外面发生的事情，也可以保持隐形？当我看到任何外部物体时，我所看到的意识就会停留在我和它之间，将它包围在一个细长的、无形的轮廓中，阻止我直接接触物质形式；因为在我接触到它之前，它就会以某种方式挥发掉，就像一个白热的物体移向潮湿的物体，实际上从未接触到水分，因为它本身总是先有一个蒸发区。在那种布满不同状态和印象的屏幕上，当我阅读时，我的意识会悄悄地展开，从我内心最深处隐藏的愿望到在我眼前展开的完全外在的地平线景观。花园的脚下，从一开始就是我最永久和最亲密的部分，它不断运动的杠杆控制着所有其他部分，是我对我正在阅读的书的哲学丰富性和美丽的信念，也是我的信念。无论这本书是什么，我都希望将这些内容运用到自己身上。 因为即使我是在贡布雷买的，在博兰奇店外看到过它，博兰奇的杂货店离我们家太远，弗朗索瓦丝无法在那里做生意，就像她对加缪那样，但她作为文具商和书商更享受习俗；即使我看到了它，用绳子绑起来，固定在装饰着他门口两侧的月刊和小册子的马赛克中，这个门口比大教堂的门更神秘，更充满暗示，我也应该我注意到并在那里买了它，只是因为我认出这是一本在我看来受到校长或学校朋友好评的书，在那个特定的时间里，在我看来，他们似乎被托付了真与美的秘密，这些东西我一半能感觉到，一半不能理解，但对它的完全理解是我思想中模糊但永久的目标。

Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the discovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what Françoise would have called ‘real people.’ But none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a ‘real’ person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple, of ‘real’ people would be a decided improvement. A’real’ person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The novelist’s happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish, successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change.
在这个中心信念旁边，当我阅读时，它会不断地从我的内在自我到外部世界，走向发现真理的运动，接下来是我将参与的行动所激起的情感，因为这些下午充满了比一生中经常发生的更戏剧性和耸人听闻的事件。这些是我正在读的书中发生的事件。诚然，这些故事中的人物并不是弗朗索瓦丝所说的“真实的人”。但是，“真实”的人的快乐或不幸在我们心中激起的任何感情，只有通过这些人的心理图景才能被唤醒。欢乐或不幸；第一个小说家的聪明才智在于他的理解，因为图像是我们情感复杂结构中的一个基本元素，所以对它的简化，即纯粹而简单的对“真实”人的压制，是一个决定性的进步。一个“真实”的人，尽管我们可能深切地同情他，但在很大程度上只能通过我们的感官来感知，也就是说，他仍然是不透明的，提供了我们的情感没有力量举起的沉重负担。如果他遭遇不幸，我们只能在对他的完整认知中的一小部分中感受到任何情感；事实上，他也只能在他对自己的完整认知的一小部分中感受到任何情感。小说家的快乐发现是想到用非物质部分中的等价物来替代那些不透明的部分，即人类精神无法渗透的部分，即精神可以同化的东西。 此后，这种新生物秩序的行为和感受以真理的形式出现在我们面前并不重要，因为我们已经把它们变成了我们自己的，因为它们正在我们身上发生，它们被它们所束缚当我们狂热地翻动书页时，我们的呼吸急促，目光凝视。一旦小说家把我们带入这样一种状态，在这种状态下，就像在所有纯粹的精神状态中一样，每一种情感都会成倍增加十倍，在这种状态下，他的书可能会像一场梦一样扰乱我们，但这是一个更清晰的梦，而且是一个更清晰的梦。比我们在睡眠中获得的印象更持久；那么，为什么他在一个小时的时间里让我们释放了世界上所有的欢乐和悲伤，其中只有一些，我们应该花费我们现实生活中的数年时间来了解，而最敏锐的人，其中最强烈的部分永远不会向我们揭示，因为它们发展的缓慢过程阻止了我们对它们的感知。生活中也是如此；心变了，那是我们最大的不幸；但我们只能通过阅读或想象来了解它；因为实际上，它的变化就像某些自然现象一样，是渐进的，即使我们能够依次区分它的每一种不同状态，我们仍然无法感受到变化的实际感觉。

Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Com-bray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours.
紧接着，但与人类因素相比，我自己的一部分明显不那么亲密，将会出现或多或少投射在我眼前的故事情节发生的国家的景色，这给我留下了更深刻的印象我的心灵比其他人更重要，当我从书本上抬起眼睛时，眼前所看到的实际风景。就这样，连续两个夏天，我坐在康布雷花园的炎热里，因当时正在读的书而感到病态，渴望那片山水之地，在那里我可以看到一望无际的景色。锯木厂，清澈的水流下面，豆瓣菜床上腐烂的木头碎片；附近，紫色和红色的花朵沿着矮墙散漫地聚集着。由于我心里一直潜藏着一个女人的梦想，她会用她的爱来充实我，所以那两个夏天的梦想常常随着流水的清新和凉爽而加速；无论她是谁，我脑海中浮现出的那个女人的形象，紫色的花朵和红色的花朵都会像互补色一样立即在她的两侧绽放。

This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression—one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised—of their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and explored.
这不仅是因为我们梦到的图像永远是独一无二的，并且被我们脑海中碰巧围绕在它周围的颜色所装饰和丰富，而不是它自己的颜色；而且因为它是由颜色组成的。因为我读过的书中的场景对我来说不仅是我的想象力所描绘的比贡布雷在我眼前展示的任何场景都更生动的场景，而且在其他方​​面都是同一类型的。由于作者对它们的选择，由于我的思想会超越并预见他的印刷文字的信仰精神，因为它可能正在解释一个启示，这些场景曾经给我留下了这样的印象——我的印象几乎从来没有从我可能碰巧在的任何地方，也从来没有从我们的花园中衍生出我祖母如此鄙视的园丁的严格传统幻想的平凡产物——它们实际上是大自然本身的一部分，值得成为研究和探索。

Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments—which I isolate artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion—were only drops in a single, undeviat-ing, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life.
当我读一本书时，如果我的父母允许我去参观书中所描述的国家，我应该会感到我正在朝着最终征服真理的方向取得巨大进步。因为即使我们有一种总是被自己的灵魂包围、包围的感觉，它仍然不像是一个固定的、不可移动的监狱；它似乎是一座牢笼。相反，我们似乎被它带走了，并且永远努力超越它，闯入这个世界，当我们在我们周围无休止地听到那种不变的声音时，我们会感到永远的沮丧，这种声音不是来自外界的回声，而是来自内部的振动的共振。我们试图在我们喜爱的事物中发现我们自己赋予它们的精神魅力；我们的幻想破灭了，并了解到它们本身是贫瘠的，缺乏在我们心目中由于某些观念的联想而具有的魅力；有时，我们会调动我们所有的精神力量，以一种闪闪发光的方式来影响和征服其他人，我们很清楚，这些人位于我们之外，我们永远无法接触到他们。因此，如果我总是想象我所爱的女人在我当时最渴望参观的任何地方；如果在我秘密的渴望中，是她吸引了我，为我打开了未知世界的大门，那么这不仅仅是简单的思想联想的冒险；不，那是因为我的旅行和爱情梦想都只是瞬间——今天我人为地将它们隔离开来，就像我在不同高度、在喷射的水流中切割剖面一样，彩虹闪烁，但似乎没有流动或运动——这些只是我生命中所有力量不可抗拒的单一的、坚定不移的、不可抗拒的爆发中的一滴滴。

And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner which Françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky’s surface, and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.
然后，当我继续从我意识中紧密相连的源头追踪这些印象的外在过程时，在我到达包围它们的现实地平线之前，我发现了另一种乐趣，即舒适地坐着的乐趣，品尝空气中的好闻气味，不受任何访客的打扰；当圣伊莱尔尖塔上响起一个小时的钟声时，我看着下午已经度过的时光一滴一滴地落下，直到我听到最后一声敲击声，这使我能够将总数加起来，之后接下来的沉默似乎在我头顶的蓝天上，预示着这一天的开始，这漫长的一段时间仍然允许我读书，直到弗朗索瓦丝正在准备的美味晚餐在我对英雄的艰苦追求之后，应该会增强我的力量和精神。我的书页。而且，当每个小时敲响时，我觉得自前一个小时以来只过去了几秒钟；最新的将把自己刻在天空的表面上，靠近它的前一个，我无法相信六十分钟可以被挤进他们两个金色人物之间组成的微小的蓝色弧线中。有时，这个早熟的时刻甚至会比上一个钟声敲响两下。肯定有一个小时我没有听到罢工的声音。已经发生的事情对我来说并没有发生；我的书的魅力，一种像最深沉的睡眠一样强大的魔力，阻止了我着魔的耳朵，并消除了笼罩着寂静的蔚蓝表面上那金铃的声音。 甜蜜的周日下午，在我们贡布雷花园的栗子树下，我小心翼翼地消除了我现实生活中的每一件平常的事件，取而代之的是在这片被活水浇灌的土地上进行奇怪的冒险和野心的职业生涯，你仍然记得那些当我想起你时，我的脑海中浮现出冒险和野心，你通过一点一点地把它们包围起来并把它们包含在逐渐的结晶中（当我继续写书时，天气的热度下降了），你体现并保留了它们。慢慢地改变形状，斑驳着栗叶的图案，代表着你沉默、铿锵、芬芳、清澈的时光。

Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener’s daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming out ‘They’re coming, they’re coming!’ so that Françoise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener’s daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood.
有时候，在下午的中午，园丁的女儿会把我从书上拉下来，她像疯子一样跑过来，掀翻了盆里的一棵橘子树，割伤了一根手指，折断了一颗牙齿，并尖叫着“他们来了，他们来了！”这样我和弗朗索瓦丝也应该跑起来，才不会错过任何节目。那是驻扎在贡布雷的骑兵进行军事演习的日子，通常会经过圣希尔德加德街。当我们的仆人们坐在花园栏杆外的椅子上，盯着贡布雷的人们周日散步时，人们也从远处两栋房子之间的缝隙里盯着园丁的女儿看。车站大道，会发现头盔的闪光。然后仆人们拿着椅子匆匆走进去，因为当士兵们鱼贯而过圣希尔德加德街时，他们把街道从一边挤到另一边，他们推挤的马匹刮擦着房屋的墙壁，覆盖并淹没了人行道，就像河岸一样，现在也出现了。洪水中河道变窄。

‘Poor children,’ Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had reached the railings; ‘poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow. It’s just shocking to think of,’ she would go on, laying a hand over her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.
“可怜的孩子们，”弗朗索瓦丝几乎在到达栏杆之前就泪流满面地喊道。 ‘可怜的孩子们，就像草地上的草一样被砍倒。想到这真是令人震惊，”她继续说道，并将一只手放在自己的心口上，想必她也曾在那里感受到了震惊。

‘A fine sight, isn’t it, Mme. Françoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?’ the gardener would ask, just to ‘draw’ her. And he would not have spoken in vain.
“景色真美，不是吗，夫人。弗朗索瓦丝，所有这些年轻人都不关心自己的生命中有两根稻草吗？”园丁会问，只是为了“吸引”她。而且他的话也不会白说。

‘Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that we should care for if it’s not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you’re right all the same; it’s quite true, they don’t care! I can remember them in ‘70; in those wretched wars they’ve no fear of death left in them; they’re nothing more nor less than madmen; and then they aren’t worth the price of a rope to hang them with; they’re not men any more, they’re lions.’ For by her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce ‘lie-on,’ was not at all complimentary to the man.
‘不关心他们的生命，是吗？为什么，如果这不是主永远不会第二次赐给我们的唯一礼物——我们的生命，那世界上还有什么是我们应该关心的呢？噢，亲爱的，噢，亲爱的；你还是对的；这是真的，他们不在乎！我还记得70年代的他们；在那些悲惨的战争中，他们不再害怕死亡；他们只不过是疯子；然后，它们就不值得用来悬挂它们的绳子的价格；他们不再是人了，他们是狮子了。”因为按照她的思维方式，将一个男人与一头狮子进行比较（她习惯将其发音为“lie-on”），这对男人来说根本不是一种恭维。

The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise and the gardener, having ‘made up’ their difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war.
圣希尔德加德街拐弯太急，我们无法看到远方有人靠近，只有通过车站大道上两栋房子之间的缝隙，我们才能看到新戴的头盔朝我们冲过来。 ，并在阳光下闪烁。园丁想知道是否还有很多人要来，而且他很渴，太阳照在他的头上。于是，突然间，他的女儿会像从一座被围困的城市中跳出来，出击，拐过街角，冒着生命危险一百次，重新出现，给我们带来一壶甘草——水，消息称仍有至少一千人从蒂贝日和梅塞格利斯的方向源源不断地涌来。弗朗索瓦丝和园丁“弥补”了分歧后，将讨论发生战争时应遵循的路线。

‘Don’t you see, Françoise,’ he would say. ‘Revolution would be better, because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.’
“你难道没有看到吗，弗朗索瓦丝，”他会说。 “革命会更好，因为这样就没有人需要加入，除非他愿意。”

‘Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it’s more straightforward.’
“哦，是的，我当然可以看到这一点；更简单。”

The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop all the railways.
园丁相信，一旦宣战，他们就会停止所有铁路。

‘Yes, to be sure; so that we sha’n’t get away,’ said Françoise.
“是的，当然； “这样我们就不会逃跑了。”弗朗索瓦丝说道。

And the gardener would assent, with ‘Ay, they’re the cunning ones,’ for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.
园丁会同意，“是的，他们是狡猾的人”，因为他不允许战争只不过是国家试图对人民开的一种把戏，或者有一个人在战争中。如果有机会，他不会逃避这个世界。

But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule, ‘done,’ the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself has retreated.
但弗朗索瓦丝会赶紧回到我姨妈身边，我会回到我的书本上，仆人们会在门外重新就座，看着尘土落在人行道上，士兵们的通过所引起的兴奋逐渐平息。在秩序恢复很久之后，异常的人潮将继续使康布雷的街道变得黑暗。在每一栋房子前面，即使是那些通常还没有“完工”的房子，仆人们，有时甚至是主人，都会坐在门口凝视着，用黑色的、不规则的边缘装饰他们的门阶，就像房子的边界一样。海水退去后，比平时更猛烈的潮水把贝壳和海草留在了海滩上，就像用绣花的绉纱装饰着海滩。

Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.
然而，除了这样的日子，我通常会安静地读书。但是斯万的一次来访打断了我的阅读过程，他随后对我的阅读过程进行了评论，这让我看到了一位对我来说很陌生的作家贝戈特的作品，这产生了这样一个明确的结果：很长一段时间后，我看到的不再是开满紫色花朵的墙壁，而是在完全不同的背景下，一座哥特式大教堂的门廊上，勾勒出我梦到的一位女性的轮廓。

I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d’Octobre, he had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of warning: ‘You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,’ he added graciously, ‘that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is
我第一次听到一位比我年长的朋友谈到贝戈特，我对他怀有强烈的钦佩，他是一位名叫布洛赫的宝贵青年。听到我承认我对十月之夜的喜爱，他突然爆发出一声号角般的笑声，并以警告的方式告诉我：“你必须克服对缪塞的恶趣味，绅士。他是一个坏蛋，是最坏的蛋之一，是一个相当可憎的样本。尽管如此，我还是不得不承认，”他和蔼地补充道，“他，甚至拉辛这个人，每个人在他的一生中，都曾经写过一句诗句，它不仅相当有节奏，而且还具有其中的内容。我眼中的无上功德毫无意义。一是

They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed Bhagavat and the Lévrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of Olympus.’ It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me, ‘my master.’ But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.
在我非常亲爱的大师勒孔特神父的一篇文章中，它们被提交给我的判断，作为捍卫两个逃亡者的证据，他在不朽的众神眼中很讨人喜欢。因此，这是一本我现在没有时间阅读的书​​，看来是那位大人物推荐的书。他认为，或者他们告诉我，该书的作者，一位贝戈特，《先生》，是一位狡猾的抄写员，确实比田野里的任何野兽都更加狡猾。尽管他有时会表现出一种批判性的和平主义，一种对受苦愚人的温柔，对此我们无法解释，也很难原谅，但他的话对我来说仍然有分量，就像德尔菲神谕一样。那么，请给你读这篇抒情的散文，如果创作《博伽梵歌》和《马格努斯的利夫里耶》的泰坦尼克号节奏大师所说的话没有虚假的话，那么，在阿波罗的帮助下，你甚至可以品尝到，甚至你，我的主人，奥林匹斯山的芬芳欢乐。 ’他让我称呼他，他自己也称我为‘我的主人’，表面上是带着讽刺的口吻。但事实上，我们每个人都从这种矫揉造作中得到了一定程度的满足，还处于一个人相信通过给事物命名而赋予其真实存在的年龄。

Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have objected on principle—indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish extraction—had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfather’s humming the ‘O, God of our fathers’ from La Juive, or else ‘Israel, break thy chain,’ singing the tune alone, of course, to an ‘um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la”; but I used to be afraid of my friend’s recognising the sound, and so being able to reconstruct the words.
不幸的是，我无法通过与布洛赫的进一步谈话来平静下来，在谈话中我可能坚持要求一个解释，当他告诉我那首优美的诗句时，我对他产生的怀疑（如果你愿意的话，我从中产生了疑问） ，期望的只是真相本身的揭示）如果它们完全没有任何意义，那就更好了。因为，碰巧的是，布洛赫没有再被邀请到家里来。起初，他在那里受到了很好的接待。确实，我的祖父发现，每当我对任何一个朋友产生强烈的依恋并把他带回家时，那个朋友总是犹太人；而当我对任何一个朋友产生强烈的依恋并把他带回家时，那个朋友总是犹太人。如果他没有发现我选择作为朋友的犹太人通常不是最好的类型，他原则上不会反对这一点——事实上，他自己的朋友斯旺有犹太血统。因此，每次带新朋友回家时，我的祖父都会哼唱《哦，我们祖先的上帝》，或者是《以色列，挣脱你的锁链》，当然，这首歌是独自对着一个人唱的。 'um-ti-tum-ti-tum，tra-la”；但我曾经害怕我的朋友认出声音，从而能够重建单词。

Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.
在见到他们之前，仅仅听到他们的名字（关于这些名字，通常没有什么特别的希伯来语），他不仅会猜出我的朋友们可能确实是选民的犹太血统，甚至会猜出一些黑暗的人的血统。他们家族中隐藏的秘密。

‘And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?’
“那么他们怎么称呼你今晚要来的朋友呢？”

‘Dumont, grandpapa.’
“杜蒙，爷爷。”

‘Dumont! Oh, I’m frightened of Dumont.’
‘杜蒙！哦，我害怕杜蒙。

And he would sing:
他会唱：

Archers, be on your guard! Watch without rest, without sound,
弓箭手们，要提高警惕！不休息、不发出声音地观看，

and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call out ‘On guard! on guard,’ or, if it were the victim himself who had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather’s subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of
然后，在熟练地问了几个细节问题后，他会喊道：“警惕！”或者，如果受害人本人已经到达，并在我祖父微妙的检查下无意识地被迫承认他的出身，那么我的祖父就会向我们表明他不再有任何怀疑，只会看着我们，哼着几乎听不见的空气

What! do you hither guide the feet Of this timid Israelite?

Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields,
希伯伦甜蜜的山谷，亲爱的父辈田野，

或者，也许，

Yes, I am of the chosen race.
是的，我是被选中的种族。

These little eccentricities on my grandfather’s part implied no ill-will whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:
我祖父的这些小怪癖并不意味着他对我的朋友们有任何恶意。但布洛赫因为其他原因让我的家人不高兴。他一开始就惹恼了我父亲，父亲看到他穿着湿衣服进来，饶有兴趣地问他：

‘Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I can’t understand it; the barometer has been ‘set fair.’’
“为什么，布洛赫先生，天气有变化吗？”下雨了吗？我无法理解；晴雨表已经“设定公平”。

Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than ‘Sir, I am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them.’
布洛赫的这句话最有启发性的莫过于“先生，我绝对无法告诉您是否下雨了”。我的生活如此坚决地远离了身体上的偶然事件，以至于我的感官不再费力地告诉我它们。

‘My poor boy,’ said my father after Bloch had gone, ‘your friend is out of his mind. Why, he couldn’t even tell me what the weather was like. As if there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.’
“我可怜的孩子，”布洛赫走后父亲说道，“你的朋友疯了。”为什么，他甚至不能告诉我天气怎么样。好像还能有什么更有趣的事情一样！他是个低能儿。

Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes.
接下来，布洛赫让我祖母很不高兴，因为午饭后，当她抱怨感觉不太舒服时，布洛赫强忍着抽泣，擦掉了眼中的泪水。

‘You cannot imagine that he is sincere,’ she observed to me. ‘Why he doesn’t know me. Unless he’s mad, of course.’
“你无法想象他是真诚的，”她对我说。 ‘为什么他不认识我。当然，除非他生气了。

And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made not the least apology, saying merely: ‘I never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more per-nicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the umbrella and the watch.’
最后，当他吃午饭时迟到了一个半小时，从头到脚沾满了泥，惹恼了全家人，他并没有道歉，只是说：“我从来不让自己受到哪怕是最小程度的影响。”要么是通过大气扰动，要么是通过所谓的时间的任意划分。我愿意向社会重新介绍中国的鸦片烟斗或马来短剑，但我对那些极其有害（除了相当资产阶级之外）的工具、雨伞和手表完全没有任何指导。

In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmother’s illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive emo-tions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the ‘proper thing’ to do.
尽管如此，他仍然会在贡布雷受到接待。当然，我的父母很难为我选择他作为朋友。最后，他们认为他在听到我祖母生病时流下的眼泪是真诚的。但他们本能地或根据自己的经验知道，我们早期的冲动情绪对我们以后的行为和生活行为影响不大；对道德义务的尊重、对朋友的忠诚、完成工作的耐心、对生活规则的服从，在牢固形成和盲目遵循的习惯中拥有比这些短暂的兴奋（热情但毫无结果）更可靠的基础。他们更喜欢布洛赫，作为我自己的同伴，根据中产阶级道德的所有法则，男孩们不会给我超过适当的东西，男孩们不会意外地给我送一个篮子水果，因为那天早上，他们碰巧满怀感情地想到了我，但是，由于他们无法通过他们的想象力和情感的任何单一冲动，在义务和友谊的要求之间取得精确的平衡，因此他们无法对我产生好感。 ，对我的偏见来说，他们同样无法加载秤。即使是我们对他们造成的伤害，也不会轻易偏离他们对我们的责任，我的姨婆为他们提供了一种典型的传统性格：在与侄女争吵多年后，她再也没有和她说过话，但他们还是做出了让步。她把全部财产留给侄女的遗嘱没有改变，因为她是她的近亲，这是“正确的事情”。

But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the ‘absolutely meaningless’ beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë tired me more and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother’s mind. And he would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my great-aunt herself had led a ‘gay’ life in her younger days, and had been notoriously ‘kept.’ I could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me with extreme coldness.
但我很喜欢布洛赫；我的父母希望我幸福；我给自己设定的一些无法解决的问题，比如《米诺斯与帕西法埃的姑娘》中“毫无意义”的美丽，让我更加疲惫，让我更加不适，而在与他进一步交谈之后，我本应感到更加不适，尽管这些谈话可能是不健康的。似乎在我母亲的心里。如果不是因为一件事，他仍然会在贡布雷受到接待。当天晚上，吃过晚饭后，她告诉我（一个对我后来的生活影响很大的消息，让我一度快乐，然后更加不快乐），没有一个女人除了爱情以外什么都不想，而且有他们中没有一个人的抵抗力是男人无法克服的，他继续向我保证，他听到有无懈可击的权威人士说，我的姨婆本人在年轻时就过着“同性恋”的生活，而且臭名昭著。 “保留。”我忍不住把这么重要的信息传递给我的父母。布洛赫下次打电话时，他没有被录取，后来，当我在街上遇见他时，他以极其冷漠的态度向我打招呼。

But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.
但在贝戈特的问题上，他说的是实话。

For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one’s head and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment ‘got hold,’ the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte’s style had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would begin to speak of the ‘vain dream of life,’ of the ‘inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,’ of the ‘sterile, splendid torture of understanding and loving,’ of the ‘moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals”; that he would express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of Bergotte’s works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the ‘ideal passage’ of Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.
在最初的几天里，就像一首曲子会在人们的脑海中盘旋，很快就会让人发疯，但人们暂时还没有“抓住”它，我如此热爱的贝戈特风格的东西还没有出现。吸引了我的注意。确实，我无法放下我正在读的他的小说，但我想我只是对这个故事感兴趣，就像爱情的第一个黎明，当我们每天去某个地方遇见一个女人时。聚会或娱乐活动被我们想象中的魅力所吸引。然后我观察到他喜欢在某些地方使用罕见的、几乎古老的短语，其中隐藏的和声流动，作品本身包含和隐藏的前奏会激发和提升他的风格；也正是在这样的时刻，他开始谈论“生命的虚幻梦想”，“美丽形式的无穷无尽的洪流”，“理解和爱的贫瘠而辉煌的折磨”， “那些动人的雕像使我们大教堂迷人而庄严的正面永远显得高贵”；他将通过运用奇妙的意象来表达一整套对我来说是全新的哲学体系，我自然会将其灵感归因于开始在我耳边回响的竖琴声，这是一种伴奏。图像增添了一些空灵和崇高的东西。贝戈特的这些段落中的一个，我从其他段落中分离出来的第三或第四段，让我充满了一种喜悦，这是我在第一段中所尝到的微薄的喜悦无法比拟的，这种喜悦是我感觉自己在我灵魂的某个最深处的房间，深邃、完整、广阔，所有的障碍和隔阂似乎都被清除了。 因为所发生的事情是，虽然我在这篇文章中认识到了对不常见短语的同样的品味，同样的音乐爆发，同样的理想主义哲学，这些都出现在前面的段落中，而我没有将它们视为我的源泉。令人高兴的是，我现在不再有这样的印象：在贝戈特的一部作品中，有一个特定的段落在我的脑海中描绘出一个纯粹的二维轮廓，而是贝戈特的“理想的段落”，他的每一本书都有共同之处，所有早期的相似段落现在都融入其中，增加了一种密度和体积，由此我自己的理解似乎得到了扩大。

I was by no means Bergotte’s sole admirer; he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mother’s, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du, Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte’s latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement, but in that alone. What my mother’s friend, and, it would seem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of Notre-Dame de Paris, of Athalie, or of Phèdre, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in Bergotte’s. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out ‘true to life,’ I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother about Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Françoise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte’s sake, in the belief that he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father.
我绝不是贝戈特唯一的崇拜者。他是我母亲的一位朋友最喜欢的作家，她是一位非常有文学修养的女士。而杜博尔邦医生则让所有病人等待，直到他读完贝戈特的最新著作。正是从他的咨询室和贡布雷附近公园的一所房子里，播下了贝戈特的第一批种子，这在当时是一种罕见的植物，但现在已经普遍适应，人们发现它到处开花。整个欧洲和美洲，甚至在最小的村庄，其精致程度仍然罕见，但仅此而已。我母亲的朋友，以及杜布尔邦博士在贝戈特的作品中最喜欢的东西，似乎正是我所喜欢的东西，同样的旋律，同样的老式短语，以及其他某些东西，非常简单和简单。熟悉，但被他放在如此突出的位置，以暗示他具有特殊的品味品质；而且，在他的书中悲伤的部分，有一种粗糙，一种近乎严厉的语气。毫无疑问，他本人也意识到这些是他的主要吸引力。因为在他后来的书中，如果他偶然发现了一些伟大的真理，或者一座历史悠久的大教堂的名称，他就会中断他的叙述，并通过祈祷、撇号、冗长的祈祷，为他的叙述提供一个自由的出口。在早期的几卷书中，这些情感仍然埋藏在他的散文形式之下，只有在其表面的涟漪中才能辨别出来，当它被遮蔽在眼睛之外时，当读者无法给出精确的信息时，也许会更令人愉快、更和谐。指示电流杂音从何处开始或在何处消失。他喜欢的这些段落也是我们最喜欢的。就我而言，我对所有这些都了如指掌。 当他继续叙述他的故事时，我什至感到失望。每当他谈到一些至今仍对我隐秘之美的事物时，比如松树林或冰雹、巴黎圣母院、阿塔莉或费德尔，他都会通过一些意象让它们的美爆发和浸透。我及其本质。因此，我隐隐约约地意识到，宇宙包含着无数的元素，如果他没有把它们带到我的触手可及的范围内，我微弱的感官将无法辨别这些元素，我希望我能听听他对世界上一切事物的看法，他的一些隐喻，尤其是在某些事情上，有一天我可能有机会亲眼目睹；其中，更特别的是法国的一些历史建筑和某些海景，因为他在书中提到这些的重点表明，他认为它们具有丰富的意义和美丽。但是，唉，对于世界上几乎所有的事情，我都不知道他的看法。我毫不怀疑它会与我自己的完全不同，因为他来自一个未知的领域，而我正在努力提升自己的领域。我深信我的想法对于那个完美的灵魂来说似乎纯粹是愚蠢的，所以我完全把它们全部抹掉了，如果我碰巧在他的一本书中发现了我自己已经想到的东西，我的心会充满感激和感激。骄傲就好像某个神以其无限的慷慨将它恢复给了我，并宣称它是美丽的和正确的。 时不时地，贝戈特的一页恰好准确地表达了我在晚上睡不着的时候写信给祖母和母亲时经常使用的那些想法，而且如此简洁明了，以至于他的一页看起来像一本我收集的座右铭放在我信的开头。同样，在后来的几年里，当我开始写一本自己的书时，我的一些句子的质量似乎不够好，以至于我无法下定决心继续下去，我会找到同等的东西贝戈特的句子中我的句子。但直到那时，当我在他的书页中读到这些内容时，我才能够欣赏它们。当我自己创作它们时，我担心它们应该准确地再现我似乎在脑海中发现的东西，并且担心它们不会变得“真实”，我没有时间问自己是否我写的东西读起来会很愉快！但事实上，除了这些，没有一种语言、没有一种思想是我真正喜欢的。我狂热而不尽如人意的尝试本身就是我爱的象征，这种爱没有给我带来快乐，但尽管如此，却是强烈而深刻的。因此，当我突然在别人的著作中看到类似的短语时，也就是说，去掉了它们熟悉的顾忌、压抑和自我折磨的伴奏，我可以自由地尽情地满足自己对此类事物的胃口，只是作为一个厨师，偶尔没有时间为别人准备晚餐，那么他就可以找到时间来犒赏自己。 因此，有一天，当我在贝戈特的一本书中发现了一个关于一位老仆人的笑话时，他庄严而宏伟的风格给这个笑话增添了很大的讽刺意味，但这基本上是我经常对他说的话。我的祖母关于弗朗索瓦丝的事，还有一次，我发现他认为不值得在他的作品中的一面绝对真理的镜子中反思，这句话类似于我有机会对我们的朋友M说的一句话. 勒格朗丹（此外，我对弗朗索瓦丝和勒格朗丹先生的评论是我最愿意为了贝戈特而牺牲的评论之一，因为我相信他会发现他们毫无兴趣）；然后我突然发现，我自己卑微的存在和真理领域之间的距离没有我想象的那么远，在某些点上它们实际上是接触的；在我新获得的信心和喜悦中，我在他的印刷版上哭泣，就像在一位失散已久的父亲的怀里一样。

>From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my brain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called ‘Philosophy.’ I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.
>从他的书中，我对贝戈特的印象是一个虚弱而失望的老人，他失去了孩子，从未找到任何安慰。因此，我会在脑海中读，或者更确切地说，唱他的句子，比他本人所希望的更加柔和，更加缓慢，他最简单的短语会以一种特别温柔和充满爱意的语调打动我的耳朵。我最珍视他的哲学，并承诺终生奉献。这让我迫不及待地想达到我应该有资格在学校上“哲学”课程的年龄。我不想在那里学习或做任何其他事情，而只是想存在并完全被贝戈特的思想所引导，而且，如果当时有人告诉我，我实际上要追随的形而上学家与他毫无相似之处，那么当一位年轻的恋人向一位发誓终身忠诚的年轻恋人谈论他的爱情时，我就会感到绝望。他很快就会有其他情妇。

One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann, who had come to call upon my parents.
一个星期天，当我在花园里读书时，斯旺来拜访我的父母，打断了我。

‘What are you reading? May I look? Why, it’s Bergotte! Who has been telling you about him?’
'你在读什么？我可以看一下吗？为什么，这是贝戈特！谁跟你说过他的事？

I replied that Bloch was responsible.
我回答说布洛赫有责任。

‘Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait of Mahomet II. It’s an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes he’ll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a charming creature.’ And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception in my favour and said: ‘I know him well; if you would like him to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.’
“哦，是的，我曾经在这里见过的那个男孩，他看起来很像贝利尼的穆罕默德二世肖像。真是惊人的相似。他有同样的拱形眉毛、鹰钩鼻和突出的颧骨。当他长出胡子时，他将成为穆罕默德本人。无论如何，他的品味很好，因为贝戈特是一个迷人的人。”看到我似乎多么崇拜贝戈特，斯万从不谈论他认识的人，破例对我有利，说：“我认识他出色地;如果你想让他在你书的扉页上写几句话，我可以请他帮你。

I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about his friend. ‘Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?’
我不敢接受这样的提议，而是向斯旺提出了有关他朋友的问题。 “你能告诉我，他最喜欢的演员是谁吗？”

‘Actor? No, I can’t say. But I do know this: there’s not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you seen her?’
'演员？不，我不能说。但我确实知道这一点：舞台上没有一个他认为可以与贝尔玛相提并论的人；他把她置于所有人之上。你有看见她吗？'

‘No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.’
“不，先生，我父母不允许我去剧院。”

‘That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in Phèdre, in the Cid; well, she’s only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don’t believe very much in the ‘hierarchy’ of the arts.’ As he spoke I noticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother’s sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say ‘the ‘hierarchy,’ don’t you know, as silly people call it.’ But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the ‘hierarchy’? A moment later he went on: ‘Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as—oh, I don’t know—‘ and he began to laugh, ‘shall we say the Queens of Chartres?’ Until then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother’s sisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the ‘lyrical’ enthusiasms of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of ‘phrase-making’ was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being of no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer’s admirers at that time, at least by my mother’s friend and by Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: ‘He has a charming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once.’ But none of them had yet gone so far as to say ‘He is a great writer, he has great talent.’ They did not even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled ‘great talent’ in our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent.
'好可惜。你应该坚持。贝尔玛在菲德尔，在熙德；好吧，如果你愿意的话，她只是一名演员，但你知道我不太相信艺术的“等级制度”。”当他说话时，我注意到，以前在他与我祖母的谈话中经常让我震惊的事情姐妹们，每当他谈到严肃的事情时，每当他使用似乎暗示对某个重要主题有明确意见的表达方式时，他都会小心翼翼地用特殊的语气、机械和讽刺的语气将其隔离和消毒，就好像他在说话一样。将该短语或单词置于引号之间，并急于否认对此承担任何个人责任；谁应该说“‘等级制度’，你不知道吗，愚蠢的人们称之为‘等级制度’。”但是，如果这真是荒谬的话，他为什么要说“等级制度”呢？过了一会儿，他继续说道：“她的表演会给你带来与世界上任何艺术杰作一样高尚的灵感，因为——哦，我不知道——”然后他开始大笑，“我们可以说是女王吗？”沙特尔？”在那之前，我一直以为他对必须发表严肃意见的恐惧是巴黎人的一种优雅的态度，与我祖母姐妹的地方教条主义形成鲜明对比；我也曾想象过，这是斯万所在圈子对生活的心理态度的特征，在这个圈子里，由于前几代人的“抒情”热情的自然反应，过分重视微小而精确的事实，以前被认为是粗俗的，任何具有“造词”性质的东西都被禁止。但现在我发现自己对斯旺在面对笼统事物时总是采取的这种态度感到有点震惊。 他似乎不愿意冒发表意见的风险，只有当他能够一丝不苟地准确地提供一些精确但不重要的细节时，他才会感到轻松。但在这样做时，他没有考虑到，即使在这里，他也是在发表意见，为某件事举行简报（正如他们所说），他的细节的准确性本身就很重要。我再次想起那天晚上的晚餐，当时我非常不高兴，因为妈妈不会来我的房间，而且他认为莱昂公主举办的舞会并不重要，因此不予考虑。然而他却把自己的一生奉献给了这种娱乐。对于其他什么样的存在，他保留了严肃地表达他对事物的想法的责任，以及制定他不会放在引号之间的判断的责任；他什么时候才能停止投身于那些他同时又认为这些事情是荒谬的事情呢？我还注意到，斯旺向我谈论贝戈特时的态度，公平地说，这并不是他自己所特有的，而是当时所有这位作家的崇拜者所共有的，至少是我母亲的朋友和由杜布尔邦博士撰写。就像斯旺一样，他们会这样评价贝戈特：“他有一个迷人的头脑，非常有个性，他有自己的说话方式，虽然有点牵强，但却很令人愉快。”你永远不需要在扉页上寻找他的名字，你可以立即说出他的作品。”但他们中没有一个人会说“他是一位伟大的作家，他有伟大的才华。”他们做到了甚至根本不相信他有才华。他们没有说话，因为他们没有意识到。 我们很难从新作家的独特面貌中认识到我们一般思想博物馆中被标记为“伟大天才”的类型。仅仅因为这种相貌是新奇的，我们发现它与我们习惯上所说的天赋没有任何相似之处。我们说的是原创、魅力、精致、实力；然后有一天，我们把这些加起来，发现这就是天赋。

‘Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?’ I asked M. Swann.
“贝戈特有写过关于贝尔马的书吗？”我问斯旺先生。

‘I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of print. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year’s end to another. He is my daughter’s greatest friend. They go about together, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles.’
“我认为他在那篇关于拉辛的小文章中说过，但它一定已经绝版了。尽管如此，也许还有第二印象。我会找出答案。不管怎样，下次贝戈特来和我们一起吃饭时，我可以问他所有你想知道的事情。从一年到另一年，他从来没有错过过一周。他是我女儿最好的朋友。他们一起四处走动，参观古老的城镇、大教堂和城堡。

As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of Swann’s wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt’s conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant, and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills and valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of Mile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature’s love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.
由于我对社会等级制度的不同等级仍然一无所知，事实上，我的父亲发现我们不可能看到斯旺的妻子和女儿的任何东西，这一事实在很长一段时间内产生了相反的效果，使我将她们想象为他们与我们之间有着巨大的鸿沟，这极大地增强了他们在我眼中的尊严和重要性。我很遗憾我的母亲没有像我听到的邻居夫人那样染发、涂红嘴唇。萨泽拉特女士，请这么说。斯旺这样做了，不是为了让她的丈夫满意，而是为了让德·夏吕斯先生满意。我觉得，对她来说，我们一定是一个被蔑视的对象，这让我特别难过，因为她的女儿，我听说过，是一个非常漂亮的小女孩，我经常梦见她，总是想象她的样子。与我随意赋予她的特征和外表相同，但却具有迷人的效果。但从今天下午开始，当我知道了米勒的事后。 斯旺是一个生活在如此罕见和幸运的环境中的生物，沐浴在她的自然元素中，沐浴在如此特权的海洋中，如果她问她的父母是否有人来吃晚饭，她会用这两个音节回答：她浑身散发着天国的光芒，听到那位金色客人的名字，对她来说，贝戈特只不过是她家里的老朋友。对她来说，餐桌上的亲密谈话，就像我姨婆对我的谈话一样，将是贝戈特的话，涉及他在著作中无法讨论的所有主题，而我却很乐意谈论这些主题。曾听他宣讲神谕；最重要的是，当她去拜访其他城镇时，他会走在她身边，不为人知，光荣无比，就像远古时代从天上降临到凡人中间的神灵一样：然后我意识到这两种罕见的情况像迈尔这样的生物的价值。斯旺，同时，我在她看来是多么粗俗和无知；我强烈地感觉到，成为她的朋友是多么愉快，但又是多么不可能，我立刻充满了渴望和绝望。通常，从那时起，当我想起她时，我会看到她站在大教堂的门廊前，向我解释每座雕像的含义，并带着微笑，这是我最高的赞扬，向我介绍，作为她的朋友，贝戈特。大教堂的想法曾经在我心中激发出的所有幻想的魅力，法国丘陵和山谷以及诺曼底平原的魅力，总是会在我所形成的画面上散发出明亮和美丽的光芒。我心中的迈尔。斯旺；除了了解她、爱她之外，什么也没有了。 一旦我们相信，某个同类在某种未知的存在中占有一席之地，而该生物对我们自己的爱可以赢得我们的承认，即爱所要求的所有初步条件，他最重视的条件，他最重视的条件这使得他对其他人要么慷慨，要么漠不关心。即使是那些假装只根据外表来判断一个男人的女人，也会在外表中看到某种特殊生活方式的散发。这就是为什么他们会爱上士兵或消防员，他们的制服让他们不那么挑剔他的脸；他们亲吻并相信，在破碎的胸甲下跳动着一颗与其他人不同的心，更勇敢，更冒险，更温柔；因此，年轻的国王或王储可能会在外国旅行并进行最令人满意的征服，但完全缺乏我敢说对于外部经纪人来说必不可少的常规和经典形象。

While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, ‘How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn’t Sunday, you know!’ putting into the word ‘amusing’ an implication of childishness and waste of time), my aunt Léonie would be gossiping with Françoise until it was time for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme. Goupil go by ‘without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at Châteaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may get it properly soaked.’
当我在花园里读书时，我的姨婆永远不会理解我所做的事情，除非是在周日，因为在这一天，从事任何严肃的工作都是非法的，在这一天，她自己也会放下她的工作。缝纫（在工作日，她会说，“你怎么能继续看书自娱自乐；你知道，这不是星期天！”把“有趣”这个词带入幼稚和浪费时间的含义） ，我的莱奥妮姨妈会和弗朗索瓦丝闲聊，直到尤拉莉到达为止。她会告诉她，她刚刚见到了夫人。古皮尔“没有带伞，穿着她前几天在沙托丹为她做的丝质连衣裙”。如果她在晚祷之前还有很长的路要走，她可能会把它适当地浸泡。

‘Very likely’ (which meant also ‘very likely not’) was the answer, for Françoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative.
答案是“很可能”（也意味着“很可能不会”），因为弗朗索瓦丝并不希望绝对排除更幸福的选择的可能性。

‘There, now,’ went on my aunt, beating her brow, ‘that reminds me that I never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I must remember to ask Eulalie... Françoise, just look at that black cloud behind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be certain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn’t possibly keep on like this, it’s been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the storm breaks my Vichy water won’t ‘go down,’’ she concluded, since, in her mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil’s new dress ruined.
“好了，现在，”姨妈拍着额头继续说道，“这让我想起，我从来没有听说过她今天早上是否在升天之前到过教堂。我一定要记得问尤拉莉……弗朗索瓦丝，只要看看尖塔后面的那片乌云，石板上的光线有多弱，你就可以肯定天还没亮就会下雨。不可能再这样下去了，太热了。越早越好，因为在暴风雨来临之前，我的维希水不会“下降”，她总结道，因为在她看来，加速消化她的维希水的愿望比她的恐惧更重要见到夫人。古皮尔的新衣服被毁了。

‘Very likely.’
'很可能。'

‘And you know that when it rains in the Square there’s none too much shelter.’ Suddenly my aunt turned pale. ‘What, three o’clock!’ she exclaimed. ‘But vespers will have begun already, and I’ve forgotten my pepsin! Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.’ And falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with gilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she swallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be able to overtake it and to ‘send it down.’ ‘Three o’clock! It’s unbelievable how time flies.’
“你知道，下雨的时候广场上没有太多的庇护所。” 突然，姨妈的脸色变得苍白。 “什么，三点钟了！”她喊道。 “但是晚祷已经开始了，我忘了带胃蛋白酶了！”现在我知道为什么维希水一直躺在我的肚子上了。”她突然落在一本用紫色天鹅绒装订的祈祷书上，上面有镀金的扣子，在她的匆忙中，她从里面放出了一堆小图画，每张都在里面。一张淡黄色的花边纸，她用它来标记教堂重大节日的地点，我的姨妈一边吞下她的水，一边开始全速念诵神圣文本的话语，它的含义稍微模糊了。她的大脑不确定，在维希注射后这么长时间服用胃蛋白酶，是否仍然能够超越它并“将其发送下来”。“三点钟！”时间过得真令人难以置信。

A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain.
轻轻地敲了一下窗户，就好像有一枚导弹击中了它，接着是一声丰富的、落下的声音，虽然很轻，却好像一阵沙子从头顶的窗户上洒下来；然后秋天蔓延开来，呈现出一种秩序、一种节奏，变得流动、响亮、击鼓、音乐、无数、普遍。原来是下雨了。

‘There, Françoise, what did I tell you? How it’s coming down! But I think I heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside in this weather.’
“好了，弗朗索瓦丝，我告诉你什么了？怎么下来了！但我想我听到了花园门口的铃声：走吧，看看这种天气谁可以在外面。”

Françoise went and returned. ‘It’s Mme. Amédée’ (my grandmother). ‘She said she was going for a walk. It’s raining hard, all the same.’
弗朗索瓦丝去了又回来。 “是夫人。” Amédée（我的祖母）。 “她说她要去散步。尽管如此，雨还是很大。

‘I’m not at all surprised,’ said my aunt, looking up towards the sky. ‘I’ve always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well, I’m glad it’s she and not myself who’s outside in all this.’
“我一点也不惊讶，”姨妈抬头望着天空说道。 “我一直说她一点也不像其他人。好吧，我很高兴是她而不是我自己参与了这一切。

‘Mme. Amédée is always the exact opposite of the rest,’ said Françoise, not unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was ‘a bit off her head.’
'女士。阿梅黛总是和其他人完全相反。”弗朗索瓦丝毫不客气地说，直到她和其他仆人独处时才说出她认为我祖母“有点疯狂”的看法。

‘There’s Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,’ sighed my aunt. ‘It will be the weather that’s frightened her away.’
‘祝福结束了！尤拉莉现在永远不会来了。”姨妈叹息道。 “是天气把她吓跑了。”

‘But it’s not five o’clock yet, Mme. Octave, it’s only half-past four.’
“但是现在还不到五点，夫人。八度，现在才四点半。”

‘Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small curtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a week before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Françoise, the dear Lord must be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking vengeance upon us.’
“才四点半啊！而我就在这里，不得不拉开小窗帘，只是为了获得一丝阳光。四点半！距离加冕日仅一周。啊，我可怜的弗朗索瓦丝，亲爱的上帝一定对我们非常恼火。这些天世界已经走得太远了。正如我可怜的奥克塔夫常说的那样，我们经常忘记上帝，而他正在向我们报复。

A bright flush animated my aunt’s cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck would have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when Françoise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings would give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was repeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use, said: ‘His reverence the Curé would be delighted, enchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His reverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.’
姨妈的脸颊泛起红晕。是尤拉莉。不幸的是，她刚被允许到场，弗朗索瓦丝就再次出现了，她脸上带着微笑，这意味着她完全参与到了快乐中，她毫不怀疑，她的消息会给我姨妈带来欢乐，阐明了每一个细节。音节，以表明，尽管她必须将它们翻译成间接引语，但她正在重复，作为一个好仆人应该使用的新来访者屈尊使用的词，说：“他尊敬的神父将是很高兴，很着迷，如果女士。奥克塔夫现在没有休息，可以看到他。他的尊敬不想打扰夫人。八度。他的崇敬在楼下；我叫他到客厅去。”

Had the truth been known, the Curé’s visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as Françoise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid. The Curé (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a great many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church (he had even planned to compile a history of the Parish of Com-bray), used to weary her with his endless explanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit synchronized exactly with Eulalie’s it became frankly distasteful to my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not send the Curé away, and had to content herself with making a sign to Eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone.
如果知道真相的话，神父的来访并没有给我姨妈带来弗朗索瓦丝所想象的那种欣喜若狂的快乐，每当她不得不宣布他的到来时，她都会感到脸上洋溢着喜悦的气氛，但这种气氛并不完全符合她的感受。由她无效。本堂神父（一位出色的人，我很抱歉我没有经常与他交谈，因为即使他对艺术毫不关心，他也知道很多词源），习惯于向尊贵的来访者展示他的作品。教堂（他甚至计划编撰一部康布雷教区的历史），常常用他没完没了的解释让她厌烦，顺便说一句，这些解释从来没有丝毫改变。但当他的来访与尤拉莉的来访完全同步时，坦率地说，我姨妈变得很反感。她宁愿充分利用尤拉莉，也不愿让整个圈子都围着她转。但她不敢送神甫走，只得在他走的时候向尤拉莉打个手势不要走，这样在他走后她就可以独处一会儿了。

‘What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his easel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I can safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my life! What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing in the whole church, too.’
‘神父，我听说有一位画家在您的教堂里架起了画架，正在临摹其中一扇窗户，这是怎么回事？我虽然年纪大了，但可以肯定地说，我这辈子从来没有听说过这样的事！我想知道接下来的世界会怎样！也是整个教堂里最丑陋的东西。

‘I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for, although there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain details which are—well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don’t talk to me about the windows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the Abbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know, of Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his Duchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married her cousin.’ (My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in ‘persons’ had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must be related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral: ‘I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it somewhere.’ And for once I would side with the others, and against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school-friend and the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant.)
“我不会说它是最丑陋的，因为虽然圣伊莱尔的某些东西非常值得一游，但在我可怜的大教堂里，还有其他东西现在已经非常古老了，整个教区中只有一个从未恢复过。天知道，我们的门廊又脏又过时；尽管如此，它仍然具有雄伟的特征；以埃丝特挂毯为例，虽然我个人不会为这两幅挂毯花一分钱，但专家们把它们放在桑斯的挂毯之后。我也很清楚，除了某些细节之外——好吧，有点现实，它们所表现出的特征证明了真正的观察力。但别跟我谈论窗户。我问你，在这样的地板上留下挡住所有日光的窗户，甚至通过投掷色彩斑块来迷惑眼睛，这是常识吗？我很难给它起一个名字。不是有两块石板在同一水平面上吗？然而他们拒绝为我续约，因为如果你愿意的话，这些是贡布雷修道院院长和盖尔芒特勋爵的墓碑，你们知道，布拉班特的老伯爵，现任盖尔芒特公爵的直系祖先，还有他的公爵夫人，因为她是盖尔芒特家族的一位女士，并嫁给了她的表弟。”（我的祖母，她一贯拒绝对“人”产生任何兴趣，最终导致她混淆了他们所有的名字和头衔，每当有人提到盖尔芒特公爵夫人常常声称她一定与德·维尔帕里西斯夫人有亲戚关系。然后全家人都会大笑起来；她会试图通过回想起一些参加洗礼或葬礼的邀请来为自己辩护：“我确信其中某处有盖尔芒特葡萄酒。’这一次我会站在其他人一边，反对她，拒绝承认她的同学和吉纳维耶夫·德·布拉班特的后裔之间可能有任何联系。)

‘Look at Roussainville,’ the Curé went on. ‘It is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I am not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly like to think that the name was originally Rouville, from Radulfi villa, analogous, don’t you see, to Châteauroux, Castrum Radulfi, but we will talk about that some other time.) Very well; the church there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing ‘Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray’ which would be more in keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the famous^windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied’s brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so extraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than the rest?’
“看看鲁桑维尔，”本堂神父继续说道。 “如今它只不过是一个农民教区，尽管在古代，这个地方一定因毡帽和钟表贸易而具有相当大的重要性。 （顺便说一句，我不确定 Roussainville 的词源。我非常想认为这个名字最初是 Rouville，来自 Radulfi 别墅，类似于 Châteauroux，Castrum Radulfi，但我们会下次再谈。） 很好；很好；那里的教堂有精美的窗户，几乎都是相当现代的，包括最壮观的“路易·菲利普进入贡布雷”，这肯定更符合贡布雷本身的风格，而且据我所知，它也同样好沙特尔著名的^窗户。就在昨天，我遇到了珀塞皮德博士的兄弟，他热衷于这些事情，他告诉我，他认为这是一件最美丽的作品。但是，正如我对这位艺术家所说的那样，顺便说一句，他似乎是一个最有礼貌的人，而且似乎是一位普通的画笔大师；我对他说，你到底觉得这扇窗户有什么特别之处吗？如果有的话，就是比其他窗户脏一点点？

‘I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,’ said my aunt in a resigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be ‘tired,’ ‘he would never refuse you a new window.’
“我相信，如果您问陛下，”我姨妈用一种无奈的语气说道，因为她已经开始觉得自己会“累了”，“他绝不会拒绝给您打开一扇新窗户。”

‘You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,’ replied the Curé. ‘Why, it was just his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.’
“你可以信赖它，夫人。八度，”神甫回答道。 “哎呀，正是勋爵阁下本人才对这扇窗户提出了强烈抗议，因为他证明它代表了吉尔伯特·坏人，他是盖尔芒特勋爵，也是吉纳维芙·德·布拉班特的直系后裔，盖尔芒特家族的女儿，接受了圣伊莱尔的赦免。

‘But I don’t see where Saint Hilaire comes in.’
“但我不明白圣伊莱尔的作用。”

‘Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a yellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will remember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint Hèlier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of Sanctus Hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the case of your own patron, Sancta Eulalia; do you know what she has become in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a man of you!’
‘为什么是的，你有没有注意到，在窗户的角落里，有一个穿着黄色长袍的女士？很好，那就是圣伊莱尔（Saint Hilaire），您会记得，在该国的某些地区，他也被称为圣伊利耶（Saint Illiers）、圣赫利尔（Saint Hèlier），甚至在汝拉地区，也被称为圣伊利（Saint Ylie）。但圣希拉留斯的这些不同的腐败绝不是在受祝福的圣徒的名字中发生的最奇怪的。举个例子，我亲爱的尤拉莉亚，你自己的赞助人圣尤拉莉亚的例子；你知道她在勃艮第变成了什么吗？圣埃洛伊，不多也不少！淑女变成了绅士。你听到了吗，尤拉莉，你死后他们会让你成为一个男人！

‘Father will always have his joke.’
“父亲总是会开他的玩笑。”

‘Gilbert’s brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down, the original church, that was, which Théodebert, when he and his court left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of course, Theodeberiacus), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him; victory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Théodore has probably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated the unlucky Charles with the aid of William’ which the Curé pronounced ‘Will’am’ ‘the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit the place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass, and cut off his head. Théodore has a little book, that he lends people, which tells you the whole story.
吉尔伯特的兄弟，结巴者查尔斯，是一位虔诚的王子，但他的父亲疯子丕平因精神疾病去世，他早年就去世了，他以一个傲慢的人的身份掌握着至高无上的权力。他年轻时没有受到过管教，以至于每当他在一个小镇上看到一个他不记得长相的人时，他就会屠杀整个地方，直到最后一个居民。吉尔伯特希望向查理报仇，他烧毁了贡布雷的教堂，也就是原来的教堂，即泰奥德伯特和他的宫廷离开他在附近蒂贝齐（Thiberzy）的乡村住所时建造的教堂。当然，狄奥德贝里亚库斯（Theodeberiacus），为了出去与勃艮第人作战，答应如果圣人带他来，就在圣人伊莱尔的坟墓上建造；胜利。现在只剩下地下室了，西奥多可能已经带你进去了，因为吉尔伯特把剩下的都烧掉了。最后，他在威廉的帮助下击败了不幸的查尔斯。神父称威廉为“征服者”，这就是为什么仍有那么多英国人来参观这个地方。但他似乎并没有赢得贡布雷人民的喜爱，因为当他从弥撒中出来时，他们袭击了他，砍下了他的头。西奥多借给人们一本小书，里面告诉你整个故事。

‘But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you: to climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most active person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don’t wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,’ he went on, without noticing my aunt’s fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, ‘for there’s a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-lès-Combray, which are separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is Gaudiacus vicecomitis, as of course you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it’s quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte.’
“但毫无疑问，我们教堂最引人注目的是钟楼的景色，它充满了宏伟。当然，就你而言，由于你不是很强壮，我永远不建议你：爬我们的七级和九十级台阶，只是米兰著名大教堂的一半。对于最活跃的人来说，这已经够累的了，尤其是当你不想摔碎头骨时，你必须用手和膝盖着地，并且你要把楼梯上的所有蜘蛛网收集到你的衣服上。不管怎样，你应该裹得严严实实的，”他继续说道，没有注意到我姨妈因为仅仅暗示她可能有能力爬进他的钟楼而勃然大怒，“因为那里有一阵强风，一旦你进去了，”到顶部。有些人甚至向我保证，他们在那里感受到了死亡的寒冷。不管怎样，周日总会有一些俱乐部和社团，他们中的一些人不远千里前来欣赏我们美丽的全景，而且他们总是心满意足地回家。现在等等，下周日，如果天气好的话，你一定会发现那里有很多人，等待落潮。当然，你必须承认，从上面看到的景色就像童话故事一样，你可以称之为平原远景，它们有自己独特的魅力。天气晴朗时，您可以远眺韦尔讷伊 (Verneuil)。然后还有一件事；你可以同时看到你习惯于看到一个而没有另一个的地方，例如，维沃纳河的河道和圣阿西斯莱贡布雷的沟渠，它们实际上是由高大的树木构成的屏障；或者，再举一个例子，茹伊子爵城（Jouy-le-Vicomte）有所有运河，这就是高迪亚库斯副科姆蒂斯（Gaudiacusvicecomitis），你当然知道。 每次我去茹伊，我都会在一个地方看到一点运河，然后我转过一个拐角，看到另一个地方，但当我看到第二个地方时，我就再也看不到第一个地方了。我徒劳地试图想象他们是如何躺在一起的。这没什么好处。但是，从圣伊莱尔的山顶来看，情况就完全不同了。整个乡村像一张地图一样展现在你的面前。只是，你看不清水；你会说镇上有很大的裂痕，它被切得如此整齐，看起来就像一条面包，切开后仍然粘在一起。为了让一切变得完美，你必须同时到达这两个地方；上到圣伊莱尔山顶，下到茹伊勒子孔特。’

The Curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away Eulalie also.
本堂神父让我姨妈太累了，他一走，她就不得不把尤拉莉也送走。

‘Here, my poor Eulalie,’ she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand. ‘This is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers.’
“给你，我可怜的尤拉莉，”她用微弱的声音说，从手边的小钱包里取出一枚硬币。 “这只是为了让你在祈祷时不会忘记我。”

‘Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don’t think I ought to; you know very well that I don’t come here for that!’ So Eulalie would answer, with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would remark afterwards, ‘I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased.’
哦，但是，夫人。奥克塔夫，我认为我不应该这样做；你很清楚，我来这里不是为了这个！”所以尤拉莉每个星期天都会带着同样的犹豫和同样的尴尬回答，仿佛每一次诱惑都是第一次，而且带着不高兴的表情，这让我姨妈很高兴。我从来没有冒犯过她，因为如果碰巧尤拉莉接过钱时看上去比平时没那么阴沉，我姨妈事后就会说：“我想不出尤拉莉到底出了什么事；我只给了她我一直给的小东西，但她看起来一点也不高兴。

‘I don’t think she has very much to complain of, all the same,’ Françoise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie’s hand, but so discreetly passed that Françoise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my aunt’s many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Curé, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed. Françoise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over my aunt’s fortune (which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt’s presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the ‘same class’ as my aunt, and who would naturally ‘mix with her,’ seemed to Françoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Françoise would label ‘people like myself,’ or ‘people no better than myself,’ people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as ‘Mme. Françoise,’ just to shew that they considered themselves to be ‘not as good.’ And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such prosperity and importance that Françoise doubted Eulalie’s ability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had ‘brought in.’ It must be added that Eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Françoise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Françoise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to ‘look pleasant.’ But she would make up for that after the other’s departure; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, bul hinting at her in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like those of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her; ‘Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and one fine day He will be avenged upon them!’ she would declaim, with the sidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he says that the
“尽管如此，我认为她没什么可抱怨的，”弗朗索瓦丝会冷酷地叹息道，因为她倾向于把我姨妈可能给她自己或她的孩子们的所有东西都视为零用钱，并视为珍宝。这些小硬币在一个被宠坏了、忘恩负义的宝贝身上肆意挥霍，一个又一个星期天，这些小硬币滑落到尤拉莉的手里，但传递得如此谨慎，弗朗索瓦丝从未见过它们。她并不是想把我姨妈送给尤拉莉的钱占为己有。她已经充分享受了我姨妈所拥有的一切，因为她知道，女主人的财富自然会在世人的眼中使女仆变得高贵和荣耀。她本人在贡布雷、茹伊子爵和其他男人城市都很引人注目，值得赞扬，因为我姨妈有许多农场，神父频繁而长时间地造访，还有数量惊人的葡萄酒。她喝的维希水。弗朗索瓦丝只对我姨妈贪婪。如果她能控制我姨妈的财产（这足以满足她最高的野心），她就会以母性的凶猛来保护它免受陌生人的攻击。然而，她知道我姨妈慷慨得无可救药，如果她只把钱捐给那些已经很富有的人，她不会觉得有什么大害处。也许她觉得这些人实际上并不需要姨妈的礼物，所以不能被怀疑因此而对她表现出感情。此外，还向有钱有势的人赠送礼物，例如夫人。 Sazerat、M. Swann、M. Legrandin 和 Mme。 古皮尔，对于与我姨妈“同一阶级”的人来说，自然会“与她混在一起”，在弗朗索瓦丝看来，古皮尔似乎属于富人过着的奇怪而辉煌的生活的装饰习俗之一，他们狩猎和射击，她会带着钦佩的微笑思考这样的生活。但是，如果我姨妈以慈善来代替这种高贵的礼节，如果她的受益人属于弗朗索瓦丝所说的“像我这样的人”或“不比我更好的人”，那么事情就完全不同了。如果他们不总是称呼她为“夫人”，她就会更加鄙视那些人。弗朗索瓦丝，”只是为了表明他们认为自己“没有那么好。”当她看到这一点时，尽管她提出了所有警告，我姑妈仍然继续按照她的意愿行事，并用双手把钱扔掉（或者这样）至少，弗朗索瓦丝相信）在不值得的物品上，她开始发现，与她在尤拉莉身上挥霍的想象中的财富相比，她自己从我姨妈那里收到的礼物非常微不足道。弗朗索瓦丝怀疑尤拉莉是否有能力不假思索地用她拜访我姨妈“带来”的资金购买它。必须补充的是，尤拉莉对巨大而秘密的宝库也做出了完全相同的估计。弗朗索瓦丝.因此，每个星期天，尤拉莉走后，弗朗索瓦丝都会无情地预言她即将垮台。她讨厌尤拉莉，但同时又害怕她，因此当尤拉莉在场时，她觉得自己必须“看起来很愉快”。’但她会在对方离开后弥补这一点；确实，从来没有提到过她的名字，而是在女预言家的神谕中，或者在像传道者的传道书那样的全面人物的话语中暗示她，但措辞如此，以至于它们的特殊应用无法逃过我姨妈的眼睛。从窗帘的一侧向外看去，看看尤拉莉是否已经把前门关上了。 “阿谀奉承者知道如何让自己受欢迎，并收集面包屑；但要有耐心，要有耐心；我们的神是一位忌邪的神，总有一天他会向他们报仇！’她会朗诵道，当他说

 prosperity
繁荣

Of wicked men runs like a torrent past,
恶人如洪流奔流而过，

And soon is spent.
很快就用完了。

But on this memorable afternoon, when the Curé had come as well, and by his interminable visit had drained my aunt’s strength, Françoise followed Eulalie from the room, saying: ‘Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you look utterly tired out.’
但在这个令人难忘的下午，本堂神父也来了，无休无止的拜访耗尽了我姨妈的体力，弗朗索瓦丝跟着尤拉莉走出了房间，说道：“夫人。”奥克塔夫，我会让你休息；你看起来很累。”

And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though already dead. But hardly had Françoise arrived downstairs, when four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: ‘Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!’
我姨妈一言不发，轻轻地叹了口气，看来这一定是她的最后一次叹息，她闭着眼睛躺在那里，仿佛已经死了。但弗朗索瓦丝刚到楼下，四声猛烈的铃声就在屋子里回响，我姨妈笔直地坐在床上，喊道：“尤拉莉走了吗？”你相信吗？我忘了问她是否是。古皮尔在升天之前到达教堂。追她，快！”

But Françoise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. ‘It is most provoking,’ said my aunt, shaking her head. ‘The one important thing that I had to ask her.’
但弗朗索瓦丝独自返回，未能追上尤拉莉。 “这真是太令人恼火了，”姨妈摇着头说道。 “我必须问她一件重要的事情。”

In this way life went by for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness, her ‘little jog-trot.’ Respected by all and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing-case would send first to Françoise to make sure that my aunt was not ‘resting’—her ‘little jog-trot’ was, none the less, brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid’s confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in Combray, Françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to ‘rest,’ owing to the cries of the girl, and as Françoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning, my mother said to me: ‘Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.’
就这样，莱奥妮姨妈的生活就这样过去了，始终如一，她所谓的温和统一，假装不赞成，但内心深处充满温柔，她的“小慢跑”。仅仅在她自己的家里，我们每个人都知道推荐任何更健康的生活方式都是徒劳的，因此逐渐接受了这种生活方式，但在三街之外的村庄里也是如此，一位商人不得不将钉子钉入包装箱会首先发送给弗朗索瓦丝，以确保我的姨妈没有“休息”——尽管如此，她的“小慢跑”在同一年有一次受到了残酷的干扰。就像隐藏在叶子中的果实一样，它在人们不注意的情况下生长和成熟，直到它自己落下，有一天晚上，厨房女仆的监禁降临到我们身上。她的痛苦难以忍受，而且由于贡布雷没有助产士，弗朗索瓦丝不得不在黎明前出发去蒂贝齐取一位助产士。由于女孩的哭声，我的姨妈无法“休息”，而弗朗索瓦丝虽然距离不远，但回来得很晚，人们非常怀念她的服务。于是，早上，妈妈对我说：“跑上楼去，看看你阿姨要不要什么。”

I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing, in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her sleep, and made it ‘change speed,’ as they say of motorcars nowadays, for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: ‘The Lord be praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid’s baby. And I’ve been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take a walk every day!’ She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone’s else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and heard.
我走进她的两个房间中的第一个，透过另一个开着的门，看到姨妈侧身睡着了。我能听到她的呼吸声，几乎可以辨认出是鼾声。我正要溜走时，有什么东西，可能是我进入的声音，打断了她的睡眠，并使它“改变速度”，正如人们现在所说的汽车一样，因为她的鼾声中断了一秒钟，又开始了较低的音调；然后她醒了，半转过脸，这是我第一次看到她。一种恐怖烙印在上面；显然她刚刚从某个可怕的梦境中逃脱。她从她躺着的地方看不到我，我站在那儿不知道是该前进还是该退缩。但突然间，她似乎又回到了现实，并认识到那些令她恐惧的幻象是虚假的。喜悦的微笑，对上帝的虔诚感恩之举，上帝很高兴地承认生活不会像我们的梦想那么残酷，微弱地照亮了她的脸，并且，按照她养成的自言自语的习惯，半大声，当她独自一人时，她低声说道：“赞美主！”除了厨房女仆的孩子之外，我们这里没有什么可以打扰我们。我一直梦想着我可怜的奥克塔夫复活了，并试图让我每天去散步！”她向放在小桌子上的念珠伸出一只手，但睡眠已经过去了。再次掌握了一切，却没有给她留下达到它的力量；她平静而满足地睡着了，我蹑手蹑脚地走出房间，从那天到今天，她或其他任何人都不知道我所看到和听到的事情。

When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my aunt’s ‘little jog-trot’ never underwent any variation, I do not include those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as Françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin, the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so well ‘routined’ to it, as Françoise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have ‘upset’ her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be «mbroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, ‘Hurry up; there’s no time to be lost; don’t forget, it’s Saturday!’ while my aunt, gossiping with Françoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, ‘You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it’s Saturday.’ If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, ‘I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,’ everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: ‘Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it’s Saturday?’ And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for our walk, said, ‘What, only two o’clock!’ feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would respond in chorus: ‘Why, you’re forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very well it’s Saturday.’
当我说，除了像这次坐月子这样罕见的事情之外，我姨妈的“小慢跑”从未经历过任何变化时，我不包括那些以相同的形式定期重复的变化，真的，而不是在她的生活更加统一的基础上印上某种统一的模式。因此，举例来说，每个星期六，由于弗朗索瓦丝必须在下午去鲁桑维尔勒潘的市场，全家人都必须提前一个小时吃午饭。我姨妈已经完全养成了每周一次的例外习惯，这与她的一般习惯不同，她像其他人一样坚持这个习惯。正如弗朗索瓦丝所说，她对此已经“习惯”了，如果在星期六，她必须等到正常时间才能吃午饭，这会让她“心烦意乱”，就像她曾经有过一样，在一个平常的日子里，把午餐时间推迟到周六的时间。顺便说一句，午餐的加速给我们所有人带来了周六的个性，友善且相当有吸引力。通常，距离开饭时间还有一个小时，我们都知道，几秒钟后，我们就会看到菊苣早熟的样子，接下来是煎蛋卷的特别青睐，一块不值得的牛排这个不对称星期六的回归是那些琐碎的事件之一，壁画内的，局部的，几乎是公民的，它在平静的生活和稳定的社会秩序中创造了一种民族团结，并成为谈话和寒暄中最喜欢的主题，对于可以“按照叙述者的意愿进行刺绣的轶事”；如果我们中的任何一个人有史诗般的头脑，它就会为传奇的循环提供一个现成的核心。 天一亮，在我们穿好衣服之前，除了为了证明我们团结的力量而感到高兴之外，我们会毫无韵律或理由地互相呼唤，友好地、诚恳地、爱国地喊道：“快点，快点；快点，快点！”没有时间可以浪费；别忘了，今天是星期六！”而我的姨妈在和弗朗索瓦丝闲聊时，想到这一天会比平时更长，她会说，“你可以给他们煮一点小牛肉，因为今天是星期六。”如果十点半，有人心不在焉地掏出手表，说道：“我说，距离午餐时间还有一个半小时。”其他人都会欣喜若狂，立刻反驳道： ‘为什么，你在想什么？你忘了今天是星期六吗？”一刻钟后，我们仍然在笑，并提醒自己要上去告诉莱奥妮姨妈这个荒唐的错误，逗她开心。天空的面貌似乎也发生了变化。午饭后，太阳意识到今天是星期六，在天顶的亮度会增加一个小时，而当有人以为我们开始散步的时间已经晚了，就说：“什么，才两点钟！”圣伊莱尔尖塔上的双击使他感到强烈的悸动（通常在这个时间，高速公路上没有人经过，因为午餐或午睡而被遗弃，或者在河岸上）明亮而永远流淌的小溪，就连垂钓者也放弃了，就这样无人陪伴地溜进了空旷的天空，那里只剩下几朵徘徊的云彩迎接他们）全家人都会异口同声地回应：‘为什么，你忘了；’我们提前一个小时吃午饭；你很清楚今天是星期六。’

The surprise of a ‘barbarian’ (for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with Saturday’s special customs) who had called at eleven o’clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event which used to cause Françoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other’s surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: ‘You see, it’s Saturday.’ On reaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word ‘Saturday’ had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: ‘Oh, but surely he said something else as well. There was more than that, the first time you told it.’
一个“野蛮人”（我们这样称呼所有不熟悉星期六特殊习俗的人）在十一点钟打电话给我父亲，发现我们坐在餐桌旁，这让他大吃一惊，这曾经引起了人们的注意。弗朗索瓦丝的欢乐程度可能不亚于她一生中发生过的任何事情。如果说这位不知所措的访客不应该事先知道我们周六提前一小时吃过午饭，这让她觉得很有趣，那么更令人难以抗拒的是我父亲本人（完全正如她从心底里所同情的那样） ，带着僵化的沙文主义促使他）永远不会想到野蛮人会没有意识到如此简单的事情，因此回答了，没有进一步了解对方看到我们已经在餐厅时的惊讶： “你看，今天是星期六。”故事讲到这里，弗朗索瓦丝会停下来擦掉眼中快乐的泪水，然后，为了增添自己的乐趣，她会延长对话，为对方发明进一步的回答。 “星期六”这个词对他来说没有任何意义。到目前为止，我们非但不反对这些插补，反而觉得这个故事还不够长，并会用这样的话来说服她：“哦，但他肯定还说了一些其他的话。”当你第一次告诉的时候，事情还不止这些。”

My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses.
我的姨婆本人也会放下手中的工作，抬起头，透过眼镜看着我们。

The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the ‘Month of Mary’ devotions.
这一天还有另一个特点，即五月期间，我们常常在周六晚上晚饭后出去参加“玛丽月”灵修活动。

As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views on ‘the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be encouraged in these days,’ my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the church. It was in these ‘Month of Mary’ services that I can remember having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive.
因为我们在那里有机会见到万特伊先生，他对“年轻人的邋遢行为可悲，如今似乎受到鼓励”持非常严格的看法，所以我母亲首先会发现房间里没有什么不正常的地方。我出现了，然后我们就出发去教堂。我记得正是在这些“玛丽月”仪式中，我第一次爱上了山楂花。山楂树不仅仅存在于教堂里，因为那里虽然是圣地，但我们所有人都有权进入；但是，它布置在祭坛上，与它所参与的庆祝活动密不可分，它把一排排的树枝插在蜡烛和神圣的器皿之间，这些树枝以一种僵硬的、节日的装饰方案相互水平地绑在一起。黑色叶子的扇形轮廓使它们更加可爱，叶子上散布着大量的小簇花蕾，它们的洁白令人眼花缭乱，就像新娘的拖尾一样。虽然我不敢只通过手指看它们，但我可以感觉到，正式的方案是由生物组成的，是大自然本身，通过修剪树叶的形状，并通过添加那些白雪皑皑的皇冠装饰花蕾，使这些装饰品值得立即成为公众的欢乐和庄严的神秘。 在祭坛的更高处，一朵花随处开放，漫不经心地优雅，漫不经心地举着，就像最后的、几乎是蒸汽般的睡衣，它的一束雄蕊，细长如游丝，把花本身笼罩在一层白雾中，当我用眼睛追随它们时，在我内心的某个地方试图模仿它们绽放的动作时，我把它想象成一个身穿白衣的年轻女孩迅速而轻率地转动头部，从她收缩的瞳孔中射出诱人的目光，粗心而活着。

M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us. He belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my grandmother’s sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used often to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what he called ‘a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these days.’ My mother, on hearing that he ‘composed,’ told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil’s house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: ‘I cannot think who put that on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,’ and had turned the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less interest to himself.
文特伊先生带着他的女儿进来，坐在我们旁边。他出身于一个好家庭，曾是我祖母姐妹的音乐大师。因此，当他失去妻子并继承了一些财产后，退休到贡布雷附近时，我们经常邀请他到我们家来。但由于他的极度拘谨，他放弃了来，以免被迫与斯万见面，斯万结成了他所谓的“最不合适的婚姻，这似乎是当今的时尚。”我的母亲，听到这件事后他“作曲”，以恭维的方式告诉他，当她来看他时，他必须为她演奏一些他自己的东西。凡特伊先生本想再没有比这更好的了，但他对他人的礼貌和体贴做到了极点，总是设身处地为他人着想，以至于他害怕让他们厌烦，或者显得自负，如果他这样做的话，甚至会显得自负。让他们怀疑他自己的愿望是什么。当我父母去拜访他的那天，我陪着他们，但他们允许我留在外面，因为万特伊先生的房子，蒙茹万，坐落在一个实际上是从一座陡峭的山上挖空的地方，上面覆盖着我躲在灌木丛中，发现自己和他的客厅在同一水平线上，在楼上，距离窗户只有几英尺远。当仆人进来告诉他我父母来了时，我看到万特伊先生跑到钢琴前，摆出一张乐谱以吸引眼球。但他们一进房间，他就把它抢走了，藏在角落里。毫无疑问，他害怕让他们以为他很高兴见到他们只是因为这让他有机会向他们演奏他的一些作品。 每当我母亲在探访期间回到他演奏的话题时，他都会急忙抗议：“我想不出是谁把它放在钢琴上的； “这根本不是合适的地方。”他把话题转到了其他话题上，因为他自己对这些话题不太感兴趣。

His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the ‘good sort’ that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears.
他唯一的热情就是对女儿，而她的外表有些孩子气，看起来那么健壮，看到父亲为她的健康采取的预防措施，随时准备着备用的披肩，人们不禁会心一笑。环绕她的肩膀。我的祖母让我们注意温柔、精致、近乎胆怯的表情，这种表情经常在这个冷漠的孩子满是雀斑的脸上掠过。当她讲话时，她会立即以她的听众一定听到的方式理解自己的话，她会对误解的可能性感到震惊，并且人们会看到清晰的轮廓，就像在透明中一样在她那张“好人”的男子气概的面孔下面，是一个泪流满面的年轻女子的美丽容貌。

When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mile. Vinteuil’s cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers.
当我转身离开教堂，在祭坛前跪拜时，我再次站起身来，突然感觉一股苦甜的杏仁香味从山楂花里偷偷向我袭来，然后我注意到花上有这种味道。它们本身都是奶油色的小斑点，我想象这种香味一定隐藏在其中，就像杏仁蛋糕的味道隐藏在烧焦的部分，或者米尔的甜味一样。凡特伊的脸颊在雀斑下面。尽管山楂树沉甸甸、一动不动，但这些阵阵芬芳却像强烈生命力的低语一样向我袭来，整个祭坛都在颤抖，就像路边的树篱被活生生的触角探索，我看到一些雄蕊就想起了它。颜色近乎红色，似乎保留了春天的毒力，刺虫的刺激力现在转化为花朵。

Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil, in the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he would interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless, schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother’s utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the evenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray were constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must have taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon.
在教堂外面，我们会站在门廊上与万特伊先生交谈一会儿。男孩们会在广场上互相争抢，他会干涉，站在小孩子一边，教训大孩子。如果他的女儿用她浑厚、舒服的声音说，她很高兴见到我们，立刻就会显得她内心潜藏着某个年长、更敏感的姐姐，因为这句轻率、学生气的话语而脸红了，或许，这让我们以为她是在争取邀请去家里做客。然后，她的父亲会给她披上一件斗篷，他们会爬上一辆她自己驾驶的小马车，然后一起回到蒙茹万。至于我们自己，第二天是星期日，没有必要在弥撒前起床，如果那是一个月夜，天气温暖，那么，我的父亲不会立即带我们回家，因为他对个人荣誉的渴望，会带领我们沿着各各他山进行长途步行，我母亲完全无法确定自己的方位，甚至无法知道她可能走哪条路，这使她认为这是他战略天才的胜利。有时我们会一直走到高架桥，它开始在火车站的长长的石腿上大步迈进，对我来说，这代表了文明最后前哨之外的所有流亡的悲惨经历，因为每年，当我们从火车站下来时，巴黎，当我们到达贡布雷时，我们会被警告要特别小心，不要错过车站，要在火车停下来之前做好准备，因为火车将在两分钟内再次启动，并穿过高架桥，离开法国的土地。对我来说，贡布雷代表了基督教世界的最远边界。我们将沿着火车站大道返回，那里有镇上最有吸引力的别墅。 在他们的每个花园里，月光仿照休伯特·罗伯特的艺术，洒满了破碎的白色大理石楼梯、喷泉和半开着的大门。它的光束扫过了电报局。只剩下一根柱子，半毁了，但仍保留着永恒的废墟之美。我现在已经拖着疲惫的四肢，准备入睡了。椴树的芳香似乎是一种安慰，只有以巨大的痛苦和疲惫为代价才能获得这种安慰，而且不值得付出努力。远处的大门外，看门狗在寂静中被我们的脚步声惊醒，会发出对声吠叫，因为我仍然听到它们在晚上有时吠叫，它由他们看守（当贡布雷的公共花园被关闭时）。建在它的工地上），车站大道一定已经避难了，因为无论我在哪里，一旦他们开始交替挑战和接受，我就能再次看到它和它所有的椴树，以及它下面闪闪发光的人行道月亮。

Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother—‘Where are we?’ Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly ‘You really are wonderful!’ And from that instant I had not to take another step; the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my will. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my bed, and laid me down there like a little child.
突然，我的父亲会让我们停下来，问我的母亲：“我们在哪里？”她因步行而疲惫不堪，但仍然为她的丈夫感到自豪，她会亲切地承认她一无所知。他会耸耸肩笑起来。然后，仿佛它是用钥匙从背心口袋里滑出来的，当它出现在我们眼前时，他会向我们指出我们自己花园的后门，它与我们的花园齐头并进。圣埃斯普利特街熟悉的角落，等待着我们，在我们在未知的道路上徘徊的尽头迎接我们。我的母亲会钦佩地低声说：“你真是太棒了！”从那一刻起，我就不必再迈出一步了；在那个花园里，我脚下的地面向前移动，长期以来，我的行为不再需要任何控制，甚至不再需要我的意志的关注。习俗过来把我抱在怀里，一直抱到床上，像个小孩子一样把我放在床上。

Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of the services of Françoise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when those people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news), for some emotion (even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which prosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of course, since my aunt’s strength, which was completely drained by the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities, but which she had no idea—and could never decide how to employ. And I have no doubt that then—just as a desire to have her potatoes served with béchamel sauce, for a change, would be formed, ultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never ‘tired’—she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much depended) a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she felt ‘well’ and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already perished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone standing upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manœuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience (and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that Françoise had been robbing her, that she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by herself, of playing her own and her adversary’s hands at once, she would first stammer out Françoise’s awkward apologies, and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows. Françoise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunt’s feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise’s integrity and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would confide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be ‘as thick as thieves’ with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was Françoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Françoise’s features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servant’s heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie—like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths—proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. ‘But Françoise ought to know that,’ said Eulalie, ‘now that you have given her a carriage.’
虽然星期六提早一个小时开始，并且剥夺了弗朗索瓦丝的服务，对我姨妈来说比其他日子过得更慢，然而，当它过去的那一刻，新的一周开始时，她会不耐烦地期待着它的回归，体现了她脆弱而紊乱的身体仍然能够忍受的所有新奇和干扰。然而，这并不是说她有时不渴望一些更大的变化，她没有经历过那些不正常的时刻，在这些时刻，一个人渴望与自己拥有的东西不同的东西，当那些人通过缺乏精力或想象力，无法在自己身上产生任何动力，当钟声敲响或邮递员敲门时，他们渴望得到消息（即使是坏消息），渴望某种情感（甚至是悲伤） ）；当繁荣已经沉寂的心弦，像放在旁边的竖琴一样，渴望被一只手，甚至是一只残酷的手，再次拨动和敲响，即使它会折断它们；当意志艰难地克制住自己的冲动，放弃放任自己不受控制的欲望和随之而来的痛苦的权利时，就会很乐意将其主导权交到环境的手中，环境具有强制性，并且，它可能是，残忍。当然，由于姨妈稍稍用力就耗尽的体力，会一滴一滴地返回到她的休息池中，所以蓄水池的注满速度非常缓慢，要过几个月才能达到其他人所没有的剩余量。在他们的日常活动中使用，但她不知道——而且永远无法决定如何使用。 我毫不怀疑，就像她想要让土豆配贝夏梅尔酱来改变一下一样，最终，她会从每天重复出现那些她从未吃过的土豆泥中找到的乐趣而形成这种愿望。 “累了”——她会从那些单调的日子（她非常依赖这些日子）​​的积累中提取出一种对某种家庭灾难的强烈预期，这种灾难会立即发生，但猛烈到足以迫使她一劳永逸地实施一项计划。她知道这些改变对她的健康有益，但如果没有这样的刺激，她永远无法下定决心。她真的很喜欢我们。她会很享受为我们的英年早逝而哭泣的漫长时光。就在她感觉“很好”、没有出汗的时候，传来了房子被一场大火烧毁的消息，我们其他人都已经在这场大火中丧生，这场大火很快就会消失。不要让一块石头站在另一块石头上，但她自己仍然有足够的时间逃离，而不必过分匆忙，只要她立即从床上站起来，一定经常困扰她的梦，作为与这两者结合在一起的前景让她在多年的哀悼中充分品尝到她对我们的感情的小好处，当她突然出动为我们举行葬礼时，让全村人都惊呆了，被压垮但勇敢，垂死但挺直，至高无上且无价的强迫她在正确的时刻，没有时间可以浪费，没有余地犹豫，去她迷人的米鲁格兰农场度过夏天，那里有一个瀑布，这是一个福音。 因为从来没有发生过这样的事情，尽管事实上，当她独自一人沉浸在无休止的耐心游戏中时，她一定经常思考这样的策略是否成功（尽管它一定从一开始就让她陷入了绝望）从这些不可预见的小事实中的第一个，灾难性新闻的第一个字，其口音之后永远无法从记忆中删除，一切都带有实际的，肉体的死亡的印记，与逻辑抽象的可怕的不同她会不时地退后一步，为自己的生活增添乐趣，想象其他的小灾难，她会热情地跟进这些灾难。她会突然怀疑弗朗索瓦丝在抢劫她，她设置了一个陷阱来确认这一点，并当场抓住了她的背叛者，从而欺骗了自己。她习惯于自己玩牌，同时玩自己的牌和对手的牌，她会先结结巴巴地说出弗朗索瓦丝尴尬的道歉，然后以如此强烈的愤慨来回答他们，以至于任何人都不会生气。我们这些碰巧在这个时刻闯入她的人会发现她浑身是汗，眼睛闪闪发亮，假发披散着，露出了光秃秃的眉毛。弗朗索瓦丝一定经常在隔壁房间听到这些针对她自己的尖酸刻薄的讽刺，如果允许它们以纯粹非物质的形式存在，仅仅用言语来表达，并不能充分缓解我姨妈的感情。她低声低语，给这些话增添了实质和现实。然而，有时候，即使是这些床罩上的戏剧也无法让我姨妈满意。她必须看到她的作品上演。 于是，在周日，所有的门都神秘地关上了，她会向尤拉莉吐露她对弗朗索瓦丝正直的怀疑和除掉她的决心，而在另一天，她会向弗朗索瓦吐露她对尤拉莉不忠的怀疑，前门很快就会永远向他们关闭。再过几天，她对新的知己感到厌恶，又会与叛徒“如贼般亲密”，而在下一场演出之前，两人又会互换角色。但是，尤拉莉偶尔可能在她心里产生的怀疑只不过是稻草之火，由于缺乏燃料，它很快就会平息，因为尤拉莉并不和她住在一起。当嫌疑人是弗朗索瓦丝时，情况就大不相同了，姨妈永远都知道她和她住在同一屋檐下，而她一旦下床，就不敢下楼去厨房，因为害怕着凉。亲眼看看她的怀疑是否确实有根据。如此循序渐进，直到她的头脑无事可做，只能在一天中的每时每刻都试图发现弗朗索瓦丝正在做什么、向她隐瞒了什么。她会察觉到弗朗索瓦丝脸上最隐秘的动作，她所说的有些矛盾，她似乎在掩饰某种欲望。她会向她表明，只要一句话，她就被揭穿了，这句话让弗朗索瓦丝脸色苍白，而我姨妈似乎在刺入她不幸的仆人的心里找到了一种残酷的满足。 就在接下来的周日，尤拉莉的一项披露——就像那些突然为探索某些新科学开辟了一个意想不到的领域的发现之一，而迄今为止，这些新科学一直只遵循人迹罕至的道路——向我姨妈证明，她自己最严重的怀疑已经远远落空了。缺乏令人震惊的事实。 “但是弗朗索瓦丝应该知道这一点，”尤拉莉说，“既然你已经给了她一辆马车。’

‘Now that I have given her a carriage!’ gasped my aunt.
“现在我已经给她一辆马车了！”姨妈喘着气说道。

‘Oh, but I didn’t know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.’
“哦，但我不知道；”我只是这么认为；昨天我看见她乘坐敞篷马车经过，像阿塔班一样骄傲，前往鲁桑维尔市场。我猜想一定是夫人。奥克塔夫把它给了她。

So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other’s devices. My mother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt’s least word and gesture. When she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms—a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the ‘machinery’ of life at Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles.
就这样渐渐地，直到弗朗索瓦丝和我的姨妈，即采石场和猎人，不断地试图阻止对方的装置。我母亲担心弗朗索瓦丝会对我姨妈产生真正的仇恨，因为她竭尽全力惹恼她。不管怎样，弗朗索瓦丝已经越来越仔细地注意我姨妈最细微的言语和动作。当她必须向她询问任何事情时，她首先会犹豫很长时间，决定如何最好地开始。而当她说出自己的要求时，她就会偷偷地看着我姑姑，从她的表情中猜测她的想法，以及她会如何回答。 通过这种方式，一位一直在阅读 17 世纪回忆录并希望能更接近伟大的路易的艺术家，会认为当他构建了一个追溯自己血统的谱系时，他正在朝这个方向取得进展。某个历史家族，或者当他与欧洲的一位在位君主进行通信时，他就会对自己在寻求通过纯粹的外在形式的精确且因此毫无生气的复制品来建立相似性时所犯的错误视而不见。一个乡村小镇上的中年女士，除了全心全意地服从自己不可抗拒的怪癖，以及由于她的存在完全无所事事而产生的恶作剧精神之外，她不假思索地就看到了这一点。对于路易十四来说，她日常生活中最琐碎的事情，她早上的厕所，她的午餐，她下午的小睡，凭借其专制的独特性，假定了一些有趣的东西，可以在圣西门过去所说的中找到凡尔赛宫生活的“机器”；她也能够说服自己，她的沉默，脸上带着一丝幽默感或傲慢，将为弗朗索瓦丝提供精神评论的素材，就像她的沉默、幽默感或傲慢一样，她的精神评论充满了激情和恐惧。当一位朝臣，甚至是他最伟大的贵族，在凡尔赛宫的一条大道拐角处向国王提出请愿书时，国王表现出了傲慢的态度。

One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time.
一个星期天，当我的姨妈同时受到本堂神父和尤拉莉的探访，然后独自一人休息时，全家人都上楼向她道晚安，妈妈冒险对她这一不幸的巧合表示哀悼。这总是让两位访客同时来到她家门口。

‘I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,’ she said kindly, ‘you have had all your friends here at once.’
“我听说今天又出了问题，莱奥妮，”她和蔼地说，“你所有的朋友都在这儿了。”

And my great-aunt interrupted with: ‘Too many good things...’ for, since her daughter’s illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.
我的姨婆打断道：“太多好东西了……”因为自从她女儿生病以来，她觉得自己有责任让她尽可能地恢复活力，总是让她注意事物光明的一面。但我父亲已经开始说话了。

‘I should like to take advantage,’ he said, ‘of the whole family’s being here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin’s bad books; he would hardly say ‘How d’ye do’ to me this morning.’
“我想利用全家人都聚在一起的机会，”他说，“给你们讲一个故事，这样就不用分别给你们每个人重新开始了。”恐怕我们已经被勒格朗丹先生列入坏书了；今天早上他几乎不会对我说‘你好吗’。”

I did not wait to hear the end of my father’s story, for I had been with him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner, which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.
我没等到父亲的故事结束，因为弥撒结束后，我们经过勒格朗丹先生时，我自己也在他身边。相反，我下楼到厨房要了晚餐的账单，这对我来说每天都是新的兴趣，就像报纸上的新闻一样，让我兴奋不已，就像即将到来的节日节目一样。

As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.
当勒格朗丹先生在我们离开教堂的路上经过我们身边时，他走在一位女士身边，她是附近一栋乡间别墅的主人，我们只见过她一眼，我父亲立即向他致敬友善而矜持，走路时不停歇；勒格朗丹先生几乎没有表示礼貌，然后带着惊讶的神情，好像他没有认出我们一样，并且带着那种不希望和蔼可亲的人特有的疏远神情，他们从他们的内心深处突然退缩。眼睛似乎在一条无边无际的笔直道路的尽头看到了你，距离如此之远，以至于它们满足于将头部几乎难以​​察觉的运动指向你，与你娃娃般的尺寸成比例。

Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.
现在，与勒格朗丹同行的那位女士是一位美德的典范，广为人知，备受尊敬。毫无疑问，他是在进行一场多情的冒险，并且因为被发现而感到恼火。我父亲问自己，他怎么可能让我们的朋友不高兴。

‘I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,’ he said, ‘because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties, so little ‘dressed-up,’ so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost, which is really attractive.’
“如果他对我们生气，我会感到更加遗憾，”他说，“因为在所有那些穿着周日服装的人中，他身上有一些关于他的东西，他穿着小外套和柔软的领带，所以小“打扮”，如此简单；几乎是一种天真无邪的气质，这真的很有吸引力。

But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question, had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father’s fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: ‘Do you know, master book-lover,’ he asked me, ‘this line of Paul Desjardins?
但家族委员会的投票一致认为，整件事都是我父亲想象出来的，或者说，勒格朗丹此刻正全神贯注地想着别的事情。不管怎样，我父亲的恐惧最晚在第二天晚上就消失了。当我们长途跋涉回来时，我们在老桥附近看到了勒格朗丹本人，由于假期的原因，他在贡布雷又待了几天。他向我们伸出手：“你知道吗，书迷大师，”他问我，“保罗·德贾丁的这句话吗？”

Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.
现在树林全黑了，但天空仍然是蓝色的。

Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the most charming water-colour touch—
这不正是对这样一个时刻的美好渲染吗？也许你从未读过保罗·德贾丁 (Paul Desjardins) 的书。读读他，我的孩子，读读他；他们告诉我，这些天他已经转变为一名传教修道士，但他曾经拥有最迷人的水彩画风格——

Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.
现在树林全黑了，但天空仍然是蓝色的。

May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself, as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.’ He took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. ‘Goodbye, friends!’ he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.
愿你头顶上永远可见蓝天，我年轻的朋友；然后，即使那个时刻到来了，对我来说，现在就到了，当树林全黑时，当夜幕很快降临时，你也能像我一样，通过仰望天空来安慰自己。他从口袋里掏出一根香烟，站了很长时间，眼睛盯着地平线。 “再见，朋友们！”他突然喊道，然后就离开了我们。

At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Françoise, a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter’s craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played (lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare’s Dream) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume.
当我通常下楼去看看晚餐有什么的时候，它的准备工作就已经开始了，而弗朗索瓦丝，一个上校，为她的下属提供了所有自然的力量，就像童话故事里巨人雇佣自己一样作为仆人，他们会搅拌煤炭，将土豆蒸熟，并在适当的时候，在火上完成那些首先在一些伟大的容器中准备好的烹饪杰作，这是陶工手艺的胜利，其中包括从浴缸、锅炉、大锅和鱼水壶到野味罐子、糕点模具和奶油小锅，还包括各种形状和尺寸的锅碗瓢盆。我会在厨房女仆剥豌豆的桌子旁停下来，检查一排排的豌豆，它们排成一排并编号，就像准备比赛的绿色小弹珠一样。但让我着迷的是芦笋，带着群青色和玫瑰粉色，从它们的头上流淌出来，精细地点缀着淡紫色和天蓝色，通过它们白色的脚的一系列难以察觉的变化，仍然被花园里的土壤弄脏了一点——床：彩虹般的可爱，不属于这个世界。我觉得这些天国的色彩表明了精致生物的存在，它们很乐意呈现出植物的形态，它们通过覆盖其坚固且可食用的肉的伪装，使我能够在黎明的光芒中辨别出这些暗示的彩虹，这些蓝色的夜色，当我在晚餐后整晚都在玩耍时，我应该再次认识到这种宝贵的品质（像莎士比亚梦中的仙女一样，抒情而粗俗地开玩笑）将我简陋的房间改造成芬芳香水的凉亭

Poor Giotto’s Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto’s fresco are the flowers banded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And, meanwhile, Françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues.
斯旺给她起了个可怜的乔托慈善机构的名字，弗朗索瓦丝指派她为餐桌准备这些食物，她会把这些食物装在篮子里放在她身边。坐着，神态悲哀，仿佛世间所有的悲伤都堆在她身上。粉红色外套上方芦笋枝上的浅蓝色王冠将被精细而单独地勾勒出来，一颗颗一颗地排列，就像乔托的壁画中眉毛周围的花朵，或者是他在帕多瓦的美德篮子的图案。与此同时，弗朗索瓦丝会打开其中一只鸡的吐司，只有她知道如何烤这些鸡，这些鸡从贡布雷远远地飘到了国外，散发着她的优点的甜味，当她为我们服务时，这些鸡在餐桌上，在我个人对她性格的看法中，善良的品质暂时占主导地位。煮熟的肉的香气，她知道如何使之变得如此油腻和柔软，在我看来，这只不过是她众多美德之一的适当香水。

But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of those days when Giotto’s Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Françoise, being without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Françoise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of ‘Filthy creature! Filthy creature!’ it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead Françoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final ‘Filthy creature!’
但是那天，当我父亲与他的家人就我们与勒格朗丹的奇怪会面进行商议时，我下楼去厨房，那一天是乔托的慈善机构，在她最近被监禁后仍然非常虚弱和生病，无法做到这一点。从床上起来；弗朗索瓦丝由于得不到援助，陷入了欠款状态。当我进去时，我看到她在通向庭院的后厨房里正在杀鸡。弗朗索瓦丝愤怒地试图从耳朵下面割开它的喉咙，同时伴随着“肮脏的生物！”的尖叫声。肮脏的生物！”它使我们仆人的圣洁仁慈和油腻变得不那么突出了，第二天晚餐时，当它出现在像祭祀服一样的金色刺绣的皮肤上时，它珍贵的汁液被倒出来一滴通过从金字塔掉落。当它死后，弗朗索瓦丝擦掉了它流淌的血，然而，她并没有让她的怨恨淹没，因为她又爆发了一阵愤怒，她低头看着敌人的尸体，最后说了一句“肮脏的”。生物！

I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Françoise. But who would have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even—roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Léonie knew (though I was still in ignorance of this) that Françoise, who, for her own daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise that Françoise’s kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Françoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to ‘play the mistress’ in the house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find the measures of ‘first aid’ to be adopted. My mother sent Françoise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour elapsed, and Françoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Françoise who, in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: ‘Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!’
我蹑手蹑脚地走出厨房，爬上楼，浑身发抖。那么，我本可以祈祷弗朗索瓦丝立即被解雇。但谁会给我烤这么热的面包卷，给我煮这么香的咖啡，甚至——给我烤这样的鸡？而且，正如事情发生的那样，其他人都已经不得不做出同样的懦弱的计算。因为我姨妈莱奥妮知道（尽管我还不知道这一点）弗朗索瓦丝在与其他人打交道时表现出一种奇特的不可调和的态度，为了她自己的女儿或她的侄子，她会毫无怨言地献出自己的生命。世界。尽管如此，我姑姑仍然保留了她，因为虽然意识到她的残忍，但她还是很感激她的服务。我开始逐渐认识到，弗朗索瓦丝的善良、她的悔恨、她的美德的总和掩盖了许多这些后厨房的悲剧，正如历史向我们揭示的那样，那些被描绘成双手合十跪下的国王和王后的统治时期。教堂的窗户因压迫和流血而被玷污。我注意到这样一个事实：除了她自己的亲人之外，人类的苦难也激发了她的怜悯之心，这种怜悯之心与受害者与她之间的距离成正比。当她在报纸上读到一些不认识的人的不幸遭遇时，她的眼泪夺眶而出，但当她能够在心里对受害者有更准确的认识时，她很快就止住了。一天晚上，就在她出世后不久，厨房女仆感到一阵剧烈的疼痛。妈妈听到了她的呻吟声，站起来叫醒了弗朗索瓦丝，弗朗索瓦丝毫不为所动，宣称所有的抗议都只是装病，女孩想在家里“扮演女主人”。 医生担心会发生此类攻击，因此在我们拥有的医学词典中描述症状的页面上留下了记号，并告诉我们打开这段文字，在那里我们可以找到治疗措施的“急救”被采用。我母亲派弗朗索瓦丝去拿书，警告她不要让记号笔掉下来。一个小时过去了，弗朗索瓦丝还没有回来。母亲以为她已经回去睡觉了，就生气了，让我自己去书柜拿书。我这样做了，发现了弗朗索瓦丝，她出于好奇想知道标记所指示的内容，开始阅读这些后痛的临床描述，并且剧烈地抽泣，现在这是一种与疾病相关的问题。她对此并不熟悉。当作者提到每一个痛苦的症状时，她都会惊呼：“哦，哦，圣母，上帝有可能希望任何可怜的人类遭受这样的痛苦吗？”哦，可怜的女孩！’

But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto’s Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot: ‘Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after that. Dear, dear, it’s just as they used to say in my poor mother’s country:
但当我打电话给她，她又回到乔托慈善机构的床边时，她的眼泪立刻就止住了。她找不到任何刺激物来刺激那种令人愉悦的温柔和怜悯的感觉，她非常熟悉这种感觉，因为她经常通过阅读报纸而被感动。半夜被厨房女仆从床上拉起来时，她感到疲倦和恼怒，也没有任何其他类似的快乐；因此，当看到那些让她感动得热泪盈眶的痛苦经历时，她除了脾气暴躁的嘟囔，夹杂着苦涩的讽刺之外，什么也说不出来，当她以为我们已经消失在听不到的地方时，她说：好吧，她根本不需要做她必须做的事情来实现这一切！我敢说，她觉得这足够令人愉快了！她现在最好不要摆架子。尽管如此，他一定是一个被上帝抛弃的年轻人，才去追求那件事。亲爱的，亲爱的，就像我可怜的母亲的国家里人们常说的那样：

Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs’ tails,
啪嗒啪嗒、蜗牛和小狗的尾巴，

 And dirty sluts in plenty,
还有大量肮脏的荡妇，

Smell sweeter than roses in young men’s noses
年轻人鼻子里闻起来比玫瑰还甜

 When the heart is one-and-twenty.’
当心是一又二十的时候。

Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt’s room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress’s presence. There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions) depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the same way Françoise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt’s service.
虽然，当她的孙子头有点感冒时，她会在晚上打赌，即使她生病了，也不睡觉，看看他是否拥有他想要的一切，在天亮之前步行十英里为了及时开始她的工作，她对自己人民的同样的爱，以及她在坚实的基础上建立她的房子未来的伟大愿望的愿望，在她对待其他仆人的政策中，以一种不变的格言反映出来。 ，就是永远不让他们任何人踏进我姨妈的房间；事实上，她表现出一种骄傲，不允许任何人靠近我的姨妈，当她自己生病时，她宁愿下床亲自给维希水喝，也不愿让厨房女仆喝水。进入女主人面前的权利。法布尔（Fabre）观察到，有一种膜翅目黄蜂，即穴居黄蜂，为了在自己死后为后代提供新鲜的肉，它利用解剖学来放大其本能残忍的资源，并且，在收集了象鼻虫和蜘蛛之后，凭借惊人的知识和技能，刺穿它们的运动能力（但没有其他重要功能）所依赖的神经中枢，从而使瘫痪的昆虫在其旁边产下卵，当幼虫孵化时，将为幼虫提供一个驯服的、无害的猎物，既不能飞行，也不能抵抗，但对食品储藏室来说却是完全新鲜的：就像弗朗索瓦丝所采取的那样，她要执行她永久和坚定不移的决心，一系列狡猾而无情的策略使房子无法容纳任何其他仆人。 许多年后，我们发现，如果我们在整个季节日复一日地吃芦笋，那是因为植物的气味让可怜的厨房女仆（她必须准备芦笋）哮喘发作得很厉害，以至于她无法忍受。最后不得不离开我姨妈的服务。

Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one-of the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world, something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that Mme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when I arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed on their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen me come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the market, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin’s face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin’s hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the ‘Saint-Honoré,’ and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.
唉!我们必须改变对勒格朗丹先生的看法。我们在旧桥与他会面后的一个周日，弥撒即将结束，伴随着阳光和外界的喧嚣，我父亲被迫承认自己犯了错误。其他人侵入了教堂，一种远非神圣的气氛。古比尔女士。察觉到（事实上，所有这些人，刚才我来的有点晚了，还一动不动地坐着，眼睛盯着祈祷书；我什至可能认为，他们没有看到我进来，他们的脚没有稍微移动以推开阻碍我坐到椅子上的小跪桌）开始大声地与我们讨论各种完全平凡的话题，就好像我们已经在广场外面一样，我们看到勒格朗丹本人站在门廊晒黑的台阶上，主宰着市场五光十色的喧嚣，他是我们上次见过的那位女士的丈夫，正要把他介绍给她的妻子。该地区另一大土地所有者的。勒格朗丹的脸上流露出非凡的热情和活力。他深深地鞠了一躬，同时做了一个辅助的向后动作，使他的脊椎急剧上升到了起点后面的位置，这个姿势他一定是受到了他姐姐夫人的丈夫的训练。德康布雷默。 这种快速的恢复使勒格朗丹的臀部产生了一种紧张的肌肉波动，我不认为臀部会如此肉质；我说不出为什么，但是这种纯粹物质的波动，这种完全肉体的流畅，没有丝毫精神意义的暗示，这种被勤奋之风、最卑鄙的谄媚之风所激起的狂怒，唤醒了我的心。突然我想到了一个与我们所认识的完全不同的勒格朗丹的可能性。那位女士给了他一些关于她的车夫的口信，当他走下她的马车时，介绍中所印有的喜悦、胆怯和虔诚的印象仍然留在他的脸上。他如梦似幻地笑了笑，然后开始快步朝那位女士走去。他走得比平时更快，肩膀前后左右晃动，动作极其荒唐。总而言之，他看起来是如此彻底地沉浸在其中，忽略了所有其他考虑，仿佛他是自己幸福的毫无生气的傀儡。与此同时，我们正从门廊出来。我们从他旁边经过；他很有教养，不会扭过头去。但他的眼睛突然变成了先知的眼睛，迷失在他的远见中，他的眼睛盯着地平线上如此遥远的一点，以至于他看不到我们，因此不得不承认我们的存在。他的脸从笔直而柔软的皮毛中露出来，仍然带着一种天真无邪的神情，这皮毛似乎意识到自己不由自主地被引入了歧途，陷入了令人厌恶的辉煌环境中。 一条有斑点的领带，被广场的微风吹动，继续飘浮在勒格朗丹的面前，就像他骄傲的孤立、高贵的独立的标志。当我们到达家时，母亲发现我们忘记了“圣奥诺雷”，并要求父亲和我一起回去并告诉他们立即将其送上来。在教堂附近，我们遇到了勒格朗丹，他带着同一位女士向我们走来，并护送她上马车。他从我们身边擦身而过，并没有打断他对她说的话，而是从他的蓝眼角向我们发出了一个小信号，可以说，这个信号的开始和结束都在他的眼睑内，而且确实如此。他的面部肌肉没有丝毫运动，成功地在那位女士没有察觉的情况下通过了；但是，他努力用自己强烈的感情来弥补他们必须在其中寻找表达的有限领域，他让为我们分开的蓝色缝隙闪烁着热情的光芒，这远远超出了单纯的热情。贪玩，几乎触及流氓的边缘；他把良好友谊的精髓巧妙地化为眨眼的纵容、暗示、隐藏的含义、秘密的理解以及阴谋中共谋的所有奥秘，最后将他对友谊的保证提升到了感情的表达，甚至爱的宣言，为我们点燃，只为我们点燃，带着秘密而慵懒的火焰，而另一边的伟大女士却看不见，他是一个面容冰冷的迷恋学生。

Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same Sunday evening. ‘Come and bear your aged friend company,’ he had said to me. ‘Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with the primrose, with the canon’s beard, with the gold-cup; come with the stone-crop, whereof are posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian flora, come with that flower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter daisy, come with the snowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great-aunt’s garden ere the last snows of Lent are melted from its soil. Come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily, apparel fit for Solomon, and with the many-coloured enamel of the pansies, but come, above all, with the spring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of wirier, wafting apart, for the two butterflies’ sake, that have waited outside all morning, the closed portals of the first Jerusalem rose.’
就在前一天，他还要求我父母在同一个周日晚上送我去和他一起吃饭。 “来陪陪你的老朋友吧，”他对我说。就像旅行者从我们再也不会去的地方送来的花束一样，来吧，让我从你青春期的遥远国度呼吸那些春天的花朵的香味，很多年前我也曾在其中漫步。带着报春花，带着佳能的胡子，带着金杯来；与巴尔扎克花丛中的石作物一起到来，这是爱情的誓言，与复活早晨的花朵复活节雏菊一起到来，与金玫瑰的雪球一起到来，它们开始用它们的香味进行防腐处理。在四旬期最后的积雪从土壤中融化之前，让你姨婆花园里的小巷散发出芬芳。带着百合花的华丽丝质衣裳，适合所罗门的服装，以及三色堇的多彩珐琅来，但最重要的是，带着春风，仍然被最后的霜冻所冷却，飘散开来，因为两只蝴蝶在外面等了整个早上，第一朵耶路撒冷玫瑰的大门紧闭。

The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought still to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused to believe that he could have been impolite.
家里有人提出这样的问题：考虑到所有因素，我是否还应该被派去和勒格朗丹先生一起吃饭。但我祖母不相信他会无礼。

‘You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion.’ She added that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing. And indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals a man’s deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit’s evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes, and these alone are of importance in indicating character, are the most apt to leave us in perplexity.
“你承认他出现在教堂里，穿着非常简单，诸如此类；他看起来根本不像一个时尚人士。”她补充道；无论如何，即使在最坏的情况下，他是故意无礼的，我们最好还是假装什么也没注意到。事实上，我父亲本人虽然比我们任何人都对勒格朗丹所采取的态度更加恼火，但他可能仍然对其真正含义保留着最终的不确定性。就好像一个人的每一个态度、每一个动作，都透露出一个人深藏不露的性格一样。这些与他之前所说的毫无关系，我们无法通过罪魁祸首的证据证实我们的怀疑，因为他不会承认任何事情；我们被简化为我们自己感官的证据，面对这段支离破碎、语无伦次的回忆，我们扪心自问，我们的感官是否确实是幻觉的受害者？结果是，这些态度，而这些态度本身对于表明性格很重要，却最容易让我们感到困惑。

I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. ‘There is a charming quality, is there not,’ he said to me, ‘in this silence; for hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence.’
我和勒格朗丹在月光下在他家的露台上共进晚餐。他对我说：“在这种寂静中，有一种迷人的品质，不是吗？”对于像我一样受伤的心来说，一位小说家（您将在以后的时间里读到他）声称，除了沉默和阴影，没有任何补救办法。看到这里，我的孩子，在所有的生命中都会有一个时刻，你还有很长的路要走，那时疲倦的眼睛只能忍受一种光，像这样一个美好的夜晚为我们准备的光仍然是黑暗的房间，除了月光透过寂静的笛子呼吸的声音之外，耳朵听不到任何音乐。

I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said, it sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my courage and said to him: ‘Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the lady—the ladies of Guermantes?’ and I felt glad because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things.
我能听到勒格朗丹先生在说什么；就像他所说的一切一样，听起来很有吸引力。但我对最近第一次见到的一位女士的记忆感到不安。现在我知道勒格朗丹与当地的几位贵族关系友好，也许她也是他的熟人，我鼓起勇气对他说：“请告诉我，先生，你可以吗？”有没有机会，认识这位女士——盖尔芒特的女士们？”我感到很高兴，因为在念出这个名字时，我已经获得了一种对它的权力，仅仅通过将它从我的梦中提取出来并赋予它一种力量的行为。言语世界中的客观存在。

But, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of our friend’s blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils, reacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow. His fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows.
但是，一听到盖尔芒特这个词，我就看到我们朋友的每只蓝眼睛中间都出现了一个棕色的小酒窝，就好像它们被某种看不见的针尖刺伤了一样，而他的其余瞳孔则做出了反应。震惊之下，接收并分泌出青色溢出。他的流苏眼睑变黑，下垂。他原本僵硬、被灼伤的嘴角率先恢复了笑容，而他的眼睛里似乎仍然充满了痛苦，就像一个身经百战的英俊烈士的眼睛。

‘No, I do not know them,’ he said, but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society.
“不，我不认识他们，”他说，但他并没有用自然而对话的语气说出如此简单的一条信息，也没有用一种适合它的自然和对话的语气来回答，其中几乎没有什么可以让我惊讶的。他背诵时，每个词都有一个单独的重音，身体前倾，低下头，立即表现出一个人对一个极不可能的陈述所表现出的激烈程度，以便让人相信（就好像他不认识盖尔芒特家族一样）可能只是由于某种奇怪的命运意外），并强调一个人，发现自己无法对他痛苦的处境保持沉默，选择大声宣布，以便让听众相信他的忏悔他所做的事情不会让他感到尴尬，而是轻松、愉快、自发的，所讨论的情况，在这种情况下，与盖尔芒特家族没有关系，很可能不是被迫的，而是实际上是由勒格朗丹本人可能源于某种家庭传统、某种道德原则或神秘誓言，明确禁止他寻求与他们的交往。

‘No,’ he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered. ‘No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I have always made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart, as you know, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me about it, telling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I make myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that’s not the sort of reputation that can frighten me; it’s too true! In my heart of hearts I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches, books—two or three, pictures—rather more, perhaps, and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth (such as yours) wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough, now, to distinguish.’
“不，”他继续说道，并用他的话解释了他说话的语气。 “不，我不认识他们；我从来不想认识他们；我一直强调保持完全的独立性。本质上，如你所知，我有点激进。人们总是来找我谈论这件事，告诉我我不去盖尔芒特是错误的，我让自己看起来没有教养，不文明，是一只老熊。但这种名声并不能吓到我；这太对了！在我内心深处，我现在对世界上的一切都漠不关心，只关心几座教堂、几本书（两三本、图画），也许还有更多，还有青春的清新微风（比如你的）吹来时的月光。我的鼻孔里弥漫着花园的香味，我的老眼睛现在已经不够敏锐了，无法辨别花园里的花朵。

I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to cling to one’s independence, nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among his friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment should go against him (if so it must) by default: in a word, he was a snob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked him, ‘Do you know the Guermantes family?’ Legrandin the talker would reply, ‘No, I have never cared to know them.’ But unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because this other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this other Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of snobbery:
我不太明白为什么为了不去不认识的人家就必须坚持自己的独立性，也不明白这怎么会让一个人看起来像野蛮人或熊。但我确实明白的是，当勒格朗丹说他只关心教堂、月光和青春时，他并不完全诚实；他说他只关心教堂、月光和青春。他也关心，他非常关心那些住在乡间别墅里的人，他非常害怕与他们在一起时会引起他们的不满，因此他永远不敢让他们看到他也被列入名单。 ，在他的朋友中，中产阶级，律师和股票经纪人的家庭中，如果必须知道真相，则更愿意在他缺席的情况下，当他听不到的时候透露真相，判断应该对他不利（如果是这样的话）它必须）默认：总而言之，他是一个势利小人。当然，他永远不会用我和我的家人非常欣赏的诗意语言承认所有这些或任何内容。如果我问他，“你认识盖尔芒特家族吗？”说话的勒格朗丹会回答，“不，我从来不想认识他们。”但不幸的是，说话的人现在隶属于另一个勒格朗丹，他小心翼翼地隐藏在他的身边。他永远不会有意识地展示他的胸部，因为这个另一个人可以讲述我们自己的勒格朗丹的故事，以及他的势利，这将永远毁掉他的声誉；而另一个罗格朗丹已经用那受伤的表情、那僵硬的微笑、他说那几句话时的语气过分严肃地回答了我，用我们自己的罗格朗丹瞬间被刺伤和恶心的上千支箭，就像圣塞巴斯蒂安一样势利：

‘Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life.’ And since this other, this irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our Legrandin’s charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself, by means of what are called ‘reflexes,’ it followed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them.
‘哦，你伤害了我多少！不，我不认识盖尔芒特家族。不要让我想起我一生中的巨大悲伤。”既然这个另一个人，这个无法抑制的、占主导地位的、专制的勒格朗丹，如果他缺乏我们的勒格朗丹迷人的词汇，那么通过所谓的“反射，”因此，当说话者勒格朗丹试图让他闭嘴时，他可能已经说话了，我们的朋友对他的另一个自我的揭露所造成的坏印象感到遗憾是没有用的，因为他可以做现在只需努力减轻这些影响即可。

This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least) be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin’s snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin’s eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause.
这并不是说勒格朗丹先生在猛烈抨击势利小人时一点也不真诚。他无法（至少从他自己的知识来看）意识到他也是其中之一，因为只有与他人的激情相比，我们才真正熟悉，而我们对自己的激情的了解也不再是这样。比其他人向我们展示的要多。它们通过我们的想象力间接地对我们做出反应，用我们的想象代替了我们实际的主要动机，其他次要动机不那么明显，因此更正派。勒格朗丹的势利从来没有促使他养成拜访公爵夫人的习惯。相反，这会激发他的想象力，让公爵夫人在勒格朗丹的眼中显得拥有所有的优雅。他会被公爵夫人所吸引，同时向自己保证，他屈服于她思想的吸引力和她的其他美德，而这些是势利卑鄙的种族永远无法理解的。只有他的势利同伴知道他是他们中的一员，因为由于他们无法理解他的想象力的介入努力，他们将勒格朗丹的社会活动与其首要事业紧密并列起来。

At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he found it difficult to take Legrandin’s airs in so light, in so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: ‘I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister. He probably doesn’t remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place.’
与此同时，在家里，我们对勒格朗丹先生不再抱有任何幻想，我们与他的关系也变得更加疏远。每当妈妈发现他犯下势利罪时，她都会非常高兴，他仍然称之为势利罪，这是不可饶恕的罪。至于我父亲，他发现很难以如此超然的态度来看待勒格朗丹的态度。有一年，当有人谈论送我去巴尔贝克和我的祖母一起度过漫长的暑假时，他说：“我肯定必须告诉勒格朗丹，你要去巴尔贝克，看看他是否愿意提供你给他介绍一下他的妹妹。他可能不记得告诉我们她住在距这个地方一英里以内的地方。

My grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought to be on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and that one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights, to the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our plans; for already, in her mind’s eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when we met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne.
我的祖母认为，当一个人去海边时，应该从早到晚都在海滩上，品尝咸咸的微风，而且一个人不应该认识这个地方的任何人，因为打电话、聚会和游览都是从理应属于海空的地方偷走了这么多时间，恳求他无论如何不要向勒格朗丹谈论我们的计划；因为在她的脑海里，她已经可以看到他的妹妹，夫人。当我们正要出去钓鱼时，德·康布勒梅在我们酒店门口下了马车，并要求我们整个下午都待在室内招待她。但妈妈对她的恐惧嗤之以鼻，因为她自己觉得危险并没有那么严重，而且勒格朗丹不会表现出过分的焦虑让我们认识他的妹妹。而且，碰巧的是，我们任何人都没有必要介绍巴尔贝克这个话题，因为正是勒格朗丹本人，毫不怀疑我们曾经有过参观这些地方的意图，不请自来地走进了陷阱。晚上，我们遇见他在维冯河畔漫步。

‘There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?’ he said to my father. ‘Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am very far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil, the true Ar-mor, the sea, the land’s end, the accursed region which Anatole France—an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read—has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing.’
“今晚的云彩里有一些色彩，紫罗兰色和蓝色，非常美丽，不是吗，我的朋友？”他对我父亲说。 “尤其是一种比大气更花香的蓝色，一种瓜叶菊蓝色，在天空中看到它令人惊讶。还有那朵粉红色的小云，它不就是某种花朵、康乃馨或绣球花的颜色吗？也许，除了诺曼底与布列塔尼交汇处的英吉利海峡沿岸，我在任何地方都找不到如此丰富的例子，你可以称之为云中的植物王国。在那里，靠近巴尔贝克，在所有那些仍然如此未开化的地方中，有一个小海湾，非常安静，奥格山谷的日落，那些红色和金色的日落（尽管如此，我远非鄙视）显得司空见惯、微不足道；因为在那种潮湿而温和的气氛中，这些天堂般的花坛会在片刻之内、在晚上绽放出无比可爱的花朵，并且在凋谢之前往往会持续数小时。有的立刻就落叶了，然后看到天空中散落着无数的花瓣，硫黄的，玫瑰红的，就更美丽了。在那个被他们称为蛋白石湾的海湾里，金色的沙滩显得更加迷人，因为它像美丽的仙女座一样，紧紧地固定在周围海岸那些可怕的岩石上，固定在那个以沉船数量而闻名的葬礼海岸上，那里每一个冬天，许多勇敢的船只成为海上危险的受害者。巴尔贝克！ 地质骨架中最古老的骨头，位于我们的土壤之下，真正的盔甲，海洋，陆地的尽头，阿纳托尔·弗朗斯（Anatole France）——一位我们年轻的朋友应该读一读的魔法师的作品——所描绘的被诅咒的地区，在它的下面永恒的迷雾，仿佛这里确实是奥德赛中西梅里安人的土地。巴尔贝克；是的，他们现在正在那里建造旅馆，将它们叠加在古老而迷人的土地上，而他们却无力改变这片土地。在那里，能够立刻踏入如此原始又如此迷人的地区，是多么令人高兴啊。’

‘Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?’ inquired my father. ‘This young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.’
'的确！你在巴尔贝克有认识的人吗？”我父亲问道。 “这个年轻人只会和他的祖母一起在那里度过几个月，也许还有我的妻子。”

Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity—smiling mournfully the while—upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed to have penetrated my father’s skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable him to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask, ‘Why, what are you thinking about?’ But my father, inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: ‘Have you friends, then, in that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?’
勒格朗丹在直视我父亲的时候，突然被这个问题吓了一跳，无法将目光移开，于是他的目光逐渐集中，一边悲伤地微笑着，一边注视着提问者的眼睛，眼神里带着一种忧伤的神情。友好和坦率的气氛，不害怕看着他的脸，直到他似乎穿透了我父亲的头骨，就像它是一个玻璃球一样，此刻，他看到了很远很远的地方，在它的后面，有一朵色彩鲜艳的云，这为他提供了不在场证据，并使他能够建立这样的理论：就在他被问到是否认识巴尔贝克的人时，他一直在想别的事情，所以没有听到问题。一般来说，这些策略会让提问者继续问：“为什么，你在想什么？”但我父亲好奇、恼怒、残忍地重复道：“那么，你在那个街区有朋友吗？你知道巴尔贝克吗？”这么好？

In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction; then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to answer, he said to us: ‘I have friends all the world over, wherever there are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come together to offer a common supplication, with pathetic obstinacy, to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them.’
在最后的绝望的努力中，勒格朗丹的微笑目光挣扎到了温柔、模糊、坦率和心烦意乱的极限；然后，毫无疑问，他感觉现在除了回答之外别无他法，他对我们说：“我的朋友遍布世界各地，无论哪里有成群结队的树木，它们受到了打击，但没有被击败，它们聚集在一起为我们提供帮助。”这是一种常见的祈求，带着可悲的固执，向对他们毫不仁慈的恶劣天空祈祷。

‘That is not quite what I meant,’ interrupted my father, obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky. ‘I asked you, in case anything should happen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the people.’
“我的意思不完全是这样。”父亲打断道，他像树一样顽固，像天空一样无情。 “我问过你，万一我婆婆出了什么事，她想感觉到她并不孤单，在天涯海角，你是否认识其中的任何人。”

‘There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,’ replied Legrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; ‘places I know well, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff’s edge; standing there by the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if anything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows not truth,’ he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, ‘that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,’ he went on with emphasis, ‘the waters of that bay—more Breton than Norman—may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken, a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at your age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated.... Good night to you, neighbours,’ he added, moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed; and then, turning towards us, with a phy-sicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: ‘No Balbec before you are fifty!’ he called out to me, ‘and even then it must depend on the state of the heart.’
“和其他地方一样，我认识每个人，但我不认识任何人，”勒格朗丹回答道，他还没有准备好投降。 “我熟悉的地方，人们却很少。”但是，在我看来，那里的地方本身就像人一样，稀有而美妙的人，具有微妙的品质，可能会被生命的恩赐腐蚀和毁掉。也许它是你在悬崖边遇到的一座城堡；站在路边，它在傍晚的天空前停下来思索自己的悲伤，天空依然是玫瑰色的，一轮金色的月亮正从天空中爬升；而返航的渔船，在海峡的水丝上留下褶皱，在桅顶上悬挂着三角旗，并悬挂着它的旗帜。或者，也许它只是一栋简单的住宅，孤零零地矗立着，丑陋，甚至看起来胆怯，但充满浪漫，向每个人隐藏着一些关于幸福和失望的不朽的秘密。那片不知道真相的土地，”他以马基雅维利式的狡猾继续说道，“那片充满无限虚构的土地对任何男孩来说都是糟糕的阅读；当然，这不是我应该为我的年轻朋友选择或推荐的，因为他已经很容易感到忧郁，因为他的心已经很容易接受它的印象。充满爱情秘密和徒劳遗憾的气候可能适合像我这样年老而幻灭的人。但对于尚未形成的性情来说，它们总是致命的。相信我，”他继续强调，“那个海湾的水——更多的是布列塔尼式的，而不是诺曼式的——可能会对一颗像我一样不再完整的心产生镇静作用，尽管这种作用的价值值得怀疑。心的伤口已经没有任何东西可以弥补。但在你这个年纪，我的孩子，那些水是禁忌的...... 邻居们，晚安。”他补充道，然后以我们已经习惯的那种闪烁其辞的唐突态度离开了我们。然后，他转向我们，举起医生的手指警告，继续咨询：“五十岁之前不要喝巴尔贝克！”他对我喊道，“即使到了那时，也必须取决于心脏的状态。” 。’

My father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured him with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative—but an honourable occupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own sister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain—as, from his knowledge of my grandmother’s character, he really ought to have been certain—that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it.
每次我们见到他时，我父亲都会再次向他提起这件事，并用问题折磨他，但这是徒劳的：就像那个致力于伪造重写本的学术骗子一样，拥有丰富的技能、知识和勤奋，其中的百分之一就足以让他从事一个更有利可图的职业，但勒格朗丹先生，如果我们进一步坚持的话，最终会更快地建立一个完整的道德体系和下诺曼底的天体地理。他不愿向我们承认，在距巴尔贝克一英里的地方，他自己的妹妹住在自己的房子里；不久之后他发现自己不得不向我们提供一封介绍信，如果他完全确定——根据他对我祖母性格的了解，他确实应该确定——这种前景永远不会让他如此恐惧在任何情况下我们都不会想到要利用它。

*****

We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt Léonie a visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt Léonie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water’s surface, would be lying across it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: ‘Good heavens! There is Françoise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious; that means we are late.’
我们总是在晚饭前散步回来，去拜访莱奥妮姨妈。在我们贡布雷假期的第一周，当白天结束得很早时，当我们进入圣埃斯普利特街时，我们仍然可以看到从房子的窗户反射出西方天空的倒影和一排各各他山脚下呈紫色，远处的池塘倒映着它；一种炽热的光芒，常常伴随着一种灼烧和刺痛的寒冷，在我的脑海中将自己与火的光芒联系在一起，就在那时，火的光芒正在烤着准备给我的鸡，而不是诗意的我在散步中找到了快乐，以及良好的喂养、温暖和休息的感官愉悦。但到了夏天，当我们回到家时，太阳还没有落下；当我们上楼去拜访莱奥妮姨妈时，它的光线下沉，直到它们触及并沿着她的窗台躺下，会不会被大的内窗帘和将窗帘绑在墙上的带子抓住并固定住，然后裂开并分散、过滤；然后，最后，她会落在她抽屉柜的柠檬木上，并镶嵌上细小的金片，用落在森林树干中的同样精致、倾斜、阴影的光束照亮他们经过的房间。 但有时，虽然很少见，抽屉柜早已褪去了短暂的装饰，当我们转入圣埃斯普利特街时，西边的天空不再有任何反射。窗玻璃线；加略山下的池塘会失去火热的光芒，有时确实已经变成了乳白色的苍白，而一条长长的月光丝带，被水面上的每一个波纹弯曲、断裂和加宽，从一端横亘在池塘上。结束。然后，当我们靠近房子时，我们会看到一个人影站在门口，妈妈会对我说：‘天哪！弗朗索瓦丝正在照顾我们；你阿姨一定很着急；这意味着我们迟到了。’

And without wasting time by stopping to take off our ‘things’ we would fly upstairs to my aunt Léonie’s room to reassure her, to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that, on the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the ‘Guermantes way,’ and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home.
我们不会浪费时间停下来脱掉我们的“东西”，而是飞上楼去我姨妈莱奥妮的房间安抚她，用我们的身体在场向她证明她所有的悲观想象都是错误的，相反，没有什么是真实的。发生在我们身上的事情，但我们走的是“盖尔芒特之路”，天哪，当我们走那条路时，我姨妈很清楚，一个人永远无法说一个人什么时候回家。

‘There, Françoise,’ my aunt would say, ‘didn’t I tell you that they must have gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours it’s been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the Guermantes way?’
“好了，弗朗索瓦丝，”我姨妈会说，“我不是告诉过你他们一定是走上了盖尔芒特的路吗？好亲切！他们一定饿了！经过几个小时的等待，你的美味羊腿现在已经很干了。进来的时间多好啊！嗯，所以你走的是盖尔芒特的路？

‘But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,’ Mamma would answer. ‘I thought that Françoise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the kitchen-garden.’
“但是，莱昂妮，我以为你知道，”妈妈会回答。 “我以为弗朗索瓦丝看见我们从小门出去，穿过菜园。”

For there were, in the environs of Combray, two ‘ways’ which we used to take for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen: the way towards Méséglise-la-Vineuse, which we called also ‘Swann’s way,’ because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M. Swann’s estate, and the ‘Guermantes way.’ Of Méséglise-la-Vineuse, to tell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and the strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in Combray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would ‘know at all,’ and whom we would therefore assume to be ‘people who must have come over from Méséglise.’ As for Guermantes, I was to know it well enough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole of my boyhood, if Méséglise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than the ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the ‘Guermantes way,’ a sort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator. And so to ‘take the Guermantes way’ in order to get to Méséglise, or vice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always to speak of the ‘Méséglise way’ as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere, and of the ‘Guermantes way’ as typical of river scenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special excellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first stages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever upon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day, or in the course of the same walk, but the ‘Méséglise way’ one time and the ‘Guermantes way’ another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart and unaware of each other’s existence, in the sealed vessels—between which there could be no communication—of separate afternoons.
因为，在贡布雷的郊区，我们过去常走两条“路”散步，而且截然相反，根据我们选择的方式，我们实际上会从另一扇门离开房子： Méséglise-la-Vineuse，我们也称其为“斯旺之路”，因为要到达那里，必须经过斯旺先生庄园的边界和“盖尔芒特之路”。说实话，我只知道那里的路，以及周日过来贡布雷呼吸空气的奇怪的人，这一次，我的姨妈和我们任何人都不会“认识”他们，因此，我们会认为他们是“一定是从梅塞格利兹过来的人。”至于盖尔芒特，有一天我对它非常了解，但那一天还没有到来；在我的整个童年时期，如果说梅塞格利斯对我来说就像地平线一样难以接近，无论走多远，地平线仍然隐藏在一个与贡布雷周围的国家毫无相似之处的国家的褶皱之下。 ;另一方面，盖尔芒特仅意味着“盖尔芒特方式”的最终目标，理想的而非真实的，一种抽象的地理术语，如北极或赤道。因此，在我看来，“走盖尔芒特路”去梅塞格利斯，或者反之亦然，就像转向东方去西方一样荒谬。 由于我父亲过去总是说“梅塞格利斯之路”是他所知道的平原上最美丽的景色，而“盖尔芒特之路”是典型的河流风景，因此我对它们进行了投资，将它们设想为这种方式就像两个不同的实体，具有那种凝聚力，这种统一性只属于心灵的虚构；在我看来，它们中的任何一个最小的细节都是一件珍贵的东西，它展示了整体的特殊卓越性，而就在它们旁边，在我们行走的第一阶段，在我们到达其中一个或另一个的神圣土壤之前纯粹的物质道路，在某些特定的地点被设定为平原上的理想景观和河流的理想风景，对于一个热心的戏剧爱好者和戏剧爱好者来说，不值得费力去观看它们。艺术，是可能碰巧穿过剧院墙壁的小街道。但最重要的是，我在它们之间设置的距离，远比单纯以英里、码和英寸为单位的距离更明显，而是我用来思考它们的大脑的两个部分之间的距离。时间只会拉长心灵的距离之一，它将事物不可挽回地彼此分开，永远将它们保持在不同的层面上。这种区别变得更加绝对，因为我们的习惯是从不在同一天或在同一次步行过程中两条路走，而是一次走“梅塞格利兹路”，另一次走“盖尔芒特路”，从而将它们关闭。可以这么说，在不同的下午，在密封的容器中，彼此相隔很远，彼此不知道彼此的存在——容器之间无法进行任何交流。

When we had decided to go the ‘Méséglise way’ we would start (without undue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was not very long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were not going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt’s house, which opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell Théodore, from Françoise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil or coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of M. Swann’s park. Before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers. Out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which they had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little tiled house, called the Archers’ Lodge, in which Swann’s keeper lived, overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann’s marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we would, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in the same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far from home.
当我们决定走“梅塞格利兹之路”时，我们就会出发（不要操之过急，即使天空乌云密布，因为步行时间并不长，也不会离家太远），就好像我们我们没有特别去任何地方，就从我姨妈家的前门走过去，门通向圣埃斯普里特街。我们会受到枪匠的欢迎，我们会把信件扔进盒子里，当我们经过时，我们会告诉来自弗朗索瓦丝的西奥多，她已经用完了油或咖啡，然后我们会沿着有路的路离开小镇。沿着斯旺先生公园的白色栅栏。在到达之前，我们会在路上闻到他的紫丁香树的香味，出来欢迎陌生人。紫丁香从它们叶子的新鲜绿色小心中好奇地在公园的栅栏上绽放出白色或紫色的花朵，即使在树荫下，这些花朵也会在它们沐浴的阳光下闪闪发光。其中一些半隐藏在小瓦房的后面，称为弓箭手小屋，斯旺的守护者就住在里面，玫瑰色的尖塔高过哥特式山墙。与这些年轻的荷莉相比，春天的仙女显得粗俗而粗俗，在这个法国花园里，她们保留了波斯细密画的纯净而生动的色彩。 尽管我渴望用双臂拥抱它们柔顺的身躯，把它们芬芳头上的星星锁向我拉下来，但我们还是会不停地从它们身边经过，因为自从斯旺结婚后，我的父母就不再去坦森维尔了，而且，为了不显得在看他的公园，我们不会选择沿着公园边界延伸的那条路，然后直接爬上空旷的田野，而是选择另一条路，这条路通向同一个方向，但迂回，把我们带到了那里。出去离家太远了。

One day my grandfather said to my ‘father: ‘Don’t you remember Swann’s telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in Paris? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home; that will make it a little shorter.’
有一天，我的祖父对我的父亲说：“你不记得斯旺昨天告诉我们，他的妻子和女儿已经去了兰斯，而他正趁机在巴黎待一两天吗？”我们可能会去公园，因为女士们不在家；这会让它变得更短一些。

We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some of the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny balls of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only a week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry and scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day of his wife’s death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once again, the story of that walk.
我们在栅栏旁停了一会儿。丁香花期即将结束。一些树木仍然高高耸立，在高大的紫色枝形吊灯中，它们的小花球，但在它们的叶子中的许多地方，就在一周前，它们还破裂成一波又一波芬芳的泡沫，现在这些花已经枯萎了并且变色，变成空心的浮渣，干燥且无味。我的祖父向我的父亲指出，这个地方的外观在哪些方面仍然是一样的，以及自从他妻子去世那天他与老斯旺先生一起散步以来，它已经发生了多大的变化；他抓住机会再次向我们讲述了那次散步的故事。

In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away into the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it, an ‘ornamental water’ had been constructed by Swann’s parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will raise their immemorial standards among all the ‘laid-out’ scenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human interference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and superimposing itself upon the work of man’s hands. And so it was that, at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there might be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below and of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland which binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the iris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out over agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake.
在我们面前，一条种满金莲花的小路在阳光的照耀下向房子升起。但在我们的右边，公园一直延伸到远处，在平坦的地面上。斯旺的父母建造了一个“装饰水”，被周围高大的树木遮蔽，但即使在他最人工的创造中，自然也是人类必须工作的材料；某些景点将继续被其自身特殊主权的附庸所包围，并将在公园的所有“布置”风景中提高其远古标准，就像它们在远离任何人类干扰的孤独中所做的那样它们必须到处回来吞没它们，从它们暴露位置的需要中涌现出来，并叠加在人类双手的工作之上。就这样，在通往这个人工湖的小路脚下，可以看到下面两层的勿忘我花和上面的长春花交织而成的两层自然、精致、蓝色的湖水。水仙女明亮、阴暗的眉毛上系着的花环；而鸢尾花，它的剑气势汹汹地扫向四面八方，在仙鹤草和水生王杯上伸展着百合权杖，黄色和紫色的破烂荣耀，属于湖之王国。

The absence of Mlle. Swann, which—since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals—made the exploration of Tan-sonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my grandfather’s and father’s eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting—when I was obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating ‘nerves’ in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks’ time, would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind.
小姐的缺席。斯旺——因为它让我免于看到她出现在其中一条小路上的可怕风险，以及被这个有特权的小女孩认出和嘲笑的风险，她有贝戈特作为朋友，经常和他一起去参观大教堂——现在我第一次允许我去探索坦桑维尔，这对我自己来说是一件无关紧要的事情，但在我祖父和父亲的眼中，似乎给这片土地注入了一种新鲜而短暂的魅力，并且（就像完全无云的天空）登山时的天空）使这一天非常适合朝这个方向散步；我真希望看到他们的计算被证明是错误的，看到奇迹出现，女士。斯旺和她的父亲一起出现，离我们如此之近，以至于我们没有时间逃跑，因此应该有义务认识她。因此，当我突然发现草地上有一个草篮被遗忘在一根绳子旁边，而绳子的浮子在水中上下浮动时，我竭尽全力让父亲和祖父看向另一个方向，远离这个标志。毕竟她可能住在家里。不过，正如斯旺告诉我们的那样，他实际上不应该在那时离开，因为他还有一些人住在房子里，这条线可能同样属于其中一位客人。所有小路上都听不到脚步声。 在一棵高大的树上的某个地方，在它的高度上搭建了一个舞台，一只看不见的鸟拼命地试图让白天显得更短，用长长的、连续的音符探索着从四面八方压着它的孤独，但它立刻就接受了如此一致的回答，如此强烈的沉默和静止的反响，有人会说，它永远地阻止了它一直试图更快地过去的那一刻。阳光如此无情地从固定的天空落下，人们自然而然地倾向于溜走，脱离它的关注范围，甚至是沉睡的水面，它的宁静永远被在其表面蜂拥而至的昆虫入侵，当它做梦时，毫无疑问，某种想象中的漩涡加剧了我看到那漂浮的软木塞时所产生的不安，因为它似乎全速拉着它穿过镜面苍穹的寂静范围；现在几乎是垂直的，似乎快要掉下去看不见了，我开始问自己，抛开结识她的渴望和恐惧，警告小姐是否实际上不是我的责任。斯旺说鱼咬钩了——当时我不得不追赶我的父亲和祖父，他们正在呼唤我，我很惊讶我没有跟着他们沿着小路爬上山，走向开阔的田野，他们已经进入了那片田野。已经转了。我发现整条小路都洋溢着山楂花的香味。 树篱就像一连串的小教堂，在祭坛上堆满的鲜花下，教堂的墙壁已经看不见了。而在下面，太阳在地面上投射出方形的光芒，就像是从窗户照进来一样。从它们身上散发出来的香气同样浓郁，范围也很有限，就好像我一直站在女士祭坛前一样，而花朵本身也经过装饰，伸出每一束闪闪发光的雄蕊，一种漫不经心的、精致的、在华丽的建筑风格中散发出的“神经”，就像那些在教堂里，将通向屋顶阁楼的楼梯框起来或关闭窗户的垂直窗饰的那些建筑，但在这里分散成肉质的池子白色，像春天的草莓园。与这些相比，狗玫瑰显得多么简单和质朴，几周后，它们将在阳光的照耀下爬上同一条山坡小路，穿着光滑的丝绸，粉红色的紧身胸衣，第一缕风就会将其破坏和驱散。

But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to marshal! before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer’s when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of it, ‘The Sea!’
但我在山楂树前徘徊，呼吸，指挥，却是徒劳！在我的脑海中（我不知道如何理解它），迷失是为了重新发现它们看不见的、不变的气味，让自己沉浸在花朵随处可见的节奏中，带着青春的轻松愉快，时不时地就像音乐的某些音程一样出人意料；它们以取之不尽、用之不竭的丰富方式为我提供了同样魅力的无限期延续，但不允许我更深入地研究它，就像那些可以连续演奏一百遍而不会更接近其秘密的旋律一样。我暂时离开了他们，以便能够带着新的力量回到他们身边。我的目光顺着树篱外陡峭地延伸到田野的斜坡望去，一朵罂粟花被它的同类迷失了，或者是几朵懒洋洋地落在后面的矢车菊，用它们的花朵装饰着这里和那里的地面。就像挂毯的边缘一样，在其中可以不时地看到乡村主题的暗示，而这种主题在面板本身中显得很胜利；仍然很少见，像分散的房屋一样间隔开，警告我们我们正在接近一个村庄，它们向我预示着蓬松的云层下大片挥舞着的玉米，以及一朵罂粟花在细长的索具上升起，靠在树上的景象。微风吹过它猩红色的船旗，掠过它发源的肥沃黑土的浮标，让我的心跳得像一个旅人看到在某个低洼的地面上有一艘破旧的船正在被填缝并使其适合航海时的心跳一样，尽管他还没有看到它，但他却喊道：“大海！”

And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be better able to ‘take in’ when one has looked away, for a moment, at something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: ‘You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn’t it pretty?’
然后我又回到了我的山楂树旁，站在它们面前，就像站在那些绘画杰作前一样，人们想象，当一个人把目光移开一会儿，看看别的东西时，人们会更好地“欣赏”这些杰作；但我徒劳地把手指捏成框子，只为了眼前只有山楂树。它们在我心中激起的情感仍然晦涩而模糊，挣扎着无法摆脱束缚，无法飘过，与花朵合而为一。它们本身并没有给我带来启迪，我也无法召唤任何其他花朵来满足这种神秘的渴望。然后，当我们看到我们最喜欢的画家的作品与我们已经知道的任何作品都截然不同时，或者更好的是，当有人带我们把我们放在一幅画前时，我们会感到狂喜，这激发了我的狂喜迄今为止，我们所看到的只不过是一幅铅笔草图，或者当我们听到过的钢琴演奏的一段音乐再次在我们耳边响起，带着管弦乐队的辉煌和丰满时，我的祖父把我叫到了他身边。 ”，并指着坦森维尔的树篱说：“你喜欢山楂；看看这个粉红色的；不是很漂亮吗？

And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion, because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially festal—but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them ‘in colour,’ and consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of Combray, to the ‘plain,’ if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the ‘stores’ in the Square, or at Camus’s, where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one’s costume for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints, even after the child’s mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too ravishing in colour, this rustic ‘pompadour.’ High up on the branches, like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler in colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and ready for the ‘Month of Mary,’ of which it seemed already to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful.
这确实是一株山楂，不过它的花是粉红色的，甚至比白色的还要可爱。它也穿着节日服装，庆祝唯一真正的节日之一，宗教的圣日，因为它们不是由任何反复无常的偶然事件指定的，而世俗节日是在不是特别指定的日子指定的。对于这样的庆祝活动来说，它们本质上没有任何节日色彩——但它的装扮比其他的更加华丽，因为树枝上的花朵一个接一个，如此茂密，以至于树上没有一个部分是不装饰的，就像洛可可式牧羊女的拐角上缠绕的流苏一样，它们每一个都是“彩色的”，因此，按照贡布雷的审美标准，如果从规模来判断，其品质优于“素色”广场“商店”或加缪店的价格，那里最贵的饼干是粉红色的糖。就我个人而言，当奶油干酪呈粉红色时，当我被允许用碎草莓给它染色时，我对它的评价更高。这些花正是选择了某种可食用的美味物品的颜色，或者是为盛大的节日而为人们的服装增添了某种精美的颜色，这些颜色，因为它们清楚地表明了它们的优越性，所以它们的美丽是最容易被人看到的。孩子们的眼睛，因此必须总是比任何其他色彩看起来更生动、更自然，即使孩子的思想已经意识到它们不能满足食欲，也没有被裁缝选择。 事实上，我立刻就感觉到了，就像我在白花之前感受到的那样，但现在更令人惊奇的是，这些花的节日意图不是以人工方式，不是通过人类建造的手段来揭示的，但正是大自然本身自发地表达了这一点（就像一个村里商店里的妇女，在为游行队伍装饰街头祭坛时那样简单），将灌木丛埋在这些小玫瑰花结中，颜色几乎太迷人了，这种质朴的“蓬巴杜”。高高的树枝上，就像许多小玫瑰树一样，它们的花盆隐藏在纸花边的外套里，细长的茎在较大的节日里从祭坛上的森林中升起，一千个花蕾膨胀和开放，颜色更苍白，但每一次破裂时都暴露出它的血红色污点，就像在粉红色大理石杯的底部一样，比盛开的花朵更强烈地暗示着它特殊的、不可抗拒的品质。山楂树，无论它在哪里发芽，无论在哪里即将开花，都可以独自发芽并开出粉红色的花朵。它在树篱中占有一席之地，但与其他人不同，就像一个穿着节日服装的年轻女孩站在一群穿着日常服装的邋遢女人中间，她们呆在家里，装备齐全，准备迎接“玛丽月”。似乎已经形成了一部分，它穿着凉爽、玫瑰色的衣服，闪闪发光，微笑着，确实是天主教的灌木丛，而且非常令人愉快。

The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough ‘power of observation’ to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so black—which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her—I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined blue.
树篱让我们瞥见了公园内一条小巷，小巷里种满了茉莉花、三色堇和马鞭草，其中的股票打开了它们新鲜的、丰满的钱包，粉红色的芬芳和褪色的就像古老的西班牙皮革一样，而在公园里碎石路 一根长长的浇水管，漆成绿色，盘绕在地面上，从它的孔所在的地方，浇在花朵上，这些孔吸入了花朵，形成一个垂直的棱柱形扇子，由无限小的彩虹色水滴组成。突然，我站定了，无法动弹，就像当某些东西出现时，不仅需要我们的眼睛来接受它，而且涉及一种更深层次的感知并占据我们的整个存在。一个小女孩，一头浅红色的头发，似乎刚散步回来，手里拿着一把抹子，正看着我们，抬起一张布满粉红色雀斑的脸。她的黑眼睛闪闪发光，而我当时并不知道，事实上，从那时起，我就再也没有学会如何将任何强烈的印象简化为客观因素，因为正如他们所说，我没有足够的“观察力”来分离出印象。在那之后的很长一段时间里，每当我想起她时，那双明亮的眼睛就会立即在我的记忆中呈现出生动的蔚蓝，因为她的肤色是白皙的。如此之多，也许，如果她的眼睛不是那么黑——这是人们第一次见到她时最强烈的印象——我就不会像现在这样特别迷恋它们想象中的蓝色。

I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate insult.
我凝视着她，起初的目光不仅是眼睛的使者，而且所有的感官都在她的窗口中聚集并探出，惊恐而焦虑，那种渴望到达、触摸、捕获、飞向她的目光。战胜它所针对的身体，并战胜身体的灵魂；然后（我非常害怕，我的祖父和父亲随时都会看到那个女孩，可能会通过让我在他们面前奔跑而把我从她身边拉开）又是一种无意识的吸引人的表情，其目的是强迫她关注我、看到我、了解我。她向前看了一眼，又向左右看了一眼，打量着我的祖父和父亲，毫无疑问，她对他们的印象是我们都是可笑的人，因为她以一种冷漠和轻蔑的神情转过身来，退出了自己的世界。以免她的脸因留在他们的视野中而受到侮辱；当他们继续往前走而没有注意到她时，她已经追上并超越了我，而她任由她的目光在我们之间的空间上向我的方向游移，没有任何特殊的表情，似乎没有看到我，但是带着一种强烈的、半隐藏的微笑，根据我在良好教养方面所接受的指导，我无法解释这种微笑，除非它是无限厌恶的标志；与此同时，她的手在空中画出了一个不雅的手势，当她在公共场合对一个不认识的人说这个手势时，我脑子里的那本礼仪词典只提供了一个意思。 ，即故意侮辱。

‘Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?’ called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen ‘ducks,’ whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head; the little girl’s smile abruptly faded, and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again hi my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.
“吉尔贝特，过来吧； “你在做什么？”一位穿白衣的女士用尖锐的权威语气喊道，直到那一刻我才见到她，而在她远处不远的地方，一位穿着亚麻“鸭子”西装的绅士，我也见到了他。也不知道，用一双仿佛从头开始的眼睛盯着我。小女孩的笑容突然消失了，抓起抹子，头也不回地朝我这边看一眼，就走开了，一副顺从的样子，高深莫测又狡猾。

And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity—so exquisitely painful to myself—with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never penetrate.
于是，吉尔贝特的名字就这样飘进了我的耳中，她就像一个护身符一样被赋予了我，也许有一天我能够重新发现她，她的音节刚刚赋予了她明确的个性，而在片刻之前，她还被赋予了明确的个性。只是隐约看到的东西。这句话就这样出现在我的脑海里，在树干和茉莉花的花头上发出，像从绿色水管里滴下的水滴一样辛辣而凉爽；充满并照射着它所经过的纯净空气区域，它与所有其他空气分开并隔离，充满了她生命的神秘，它的音节指定了与她为伴生活、行走和旅行的快乐生物;粉红山楂树的拱门在我肩膀的高度处展开，它们对她以及她存在的未知世界的熟悉感的精髓——对我自己来说是如此的痛苦——展开，而我永远不应该深入其中。

For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: ‘Poor Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her Charlus—for that was Charlus: I recognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!’) the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte’s mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte’s level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout, ‘I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!’ However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in Paris.
有那么一会儿（当我们搬走时，我的祖父低声说道：“可怜的斯万，他们过着怎样的生活；想象着把他送走，这样她就可以单独和她的查勒斯在一起了——因为那是查勒斯：我认出了他）一次！还有那个孩子，在她这个年纪，竟然卷入了这一切！”）希尔贝特的母亲用专横的语气对她说话，没有她的回答，而是把她展示给我，给我留下了这样的印象：不得不服从别人，因为他并不确实比整个世界优越，这多少减轻了我的痛苦，使我重燃了一些希望，冷却了我爱情的热情。但很快，那种爱又在我心中涌动，就像一种反应，我那颗受羞辱的心试图上升到希尔贝特的水平，或者把她拉到自己的水平。我爱过她;我很遗憾没有时间和灵感来侮辱她，伤害她，强迫她保留对我的一些记忆。我知道她是如此美丽，我真想能够折回脚步，向她挥动拳头，大喊：“我觉得你很丑陋，很怪诞；我觉得你很丑陋。”你真是太恶心了！”然而，我走开了，随身携带着这种幸福，无论是当时还是以后，这都是我这种小男孩无法获得的幸福的第一个例证，而这种幸福是由于某些自然法则而无法实现的。这张照片上有一个小女孩，她的头发微红，皮肤上布满了粉红色的小斑点，她手里拿着一把抹子，微笑着，用一种长久、微妙、缺乏表情的目光注视着我。 她的名字的魅力，就像一朵香云，充满了粉红山楂树的拱门，她和我一起穿过它，听到了它的声音，开始征服、覆盖、防腐、美化一切它与它有任何联系：她的祖父母（我自己有幸认识他们），股东的光荣职业，甚至她在巴黎居住的香榭丽舍大街的忧郁街区。

‘Léonie,’ said my grandfather on our return, ‘I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much.’ And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk, either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover, Swann’s visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, ‘Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park.’ And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be ‘tired’ again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her—and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us—was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement ‘tiring’ to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.
“莱奥妮，”我们回来时祖父说道，“我希望今天下午有你在我们身边。”您永远不会知道坦森维尔。如果我有勇气的话，我会砍下你曾经非常喜欢的粉红色山楂枝给你。”于是我的祖父告诉了她我们散步的故事，要么只是为了逗她开心，要么可能是因为还有一些东西。希望她能受到刺激从床上起来并走出去。因为早些时候，她非常喜欢坦森维尔，而且，斯旺的来访是她最后一次来访，当时她已经对世界关闭了大门。就像后来他打电话来询问她的情况一样（她仍然是我们家里唯一被他要求见的人），她会派人下来说她现在很累，她正在休息，但她会很高兴下次再见到他，所以，今天晚上，她对祖父说：‘是的，有一天天气好的话，我会开车去公园门口兜风。 ’她说这话的时候是非常真诚的。她很想再次见到斯旺和坦森维尔；但她很高兴能再次见到斯旺和坦森维尔。但仅凭这一愿望就足以耗尽她仅存的全部力量，而一旦实现，她的力量就已经耗尽了。有时候，一阵晴朗的天气让她精神了一些，她就会起身穿衣服；有时，她会起身穿衣服。但还没到外屋，她又会“累”了，坚持要回到床上。 在她身上开始的过程——而且在她身上开始的时间比我们所有人都要早一点——是老年为死亡做准备的伟大而普遍的放弃，生命的蛹阶段，无论在哪里都可以观察到。生命被过度延长；即使是那些以最强烈的激情为彼此生活的老情人，以及那些以最密切的精神同情联系在一起的老朋友，他们在某一年之后就不再进行必要的旅行，甚至不再跨越边界。街头见面，不再通信，并且深知他们在这个世界上将不再交流。我姨妈一定非常清楚她不会再见到斯旺，她再也不会离开自己的房子了，但她似乎更愿意接受这种最终的隐居，因为我们认为，心，应该让它变得更难以忍受；也就是说，这种隔离是由于她每天都能测量到的力量逐渐而稳定的减少而强加给她的，这使得她的每一个动作、每一个动作即使不是真正痛苦，也让她感到“疲倦”，导致无所作为，孤独和沉默是安息的幸福、强化和清新的魅力。

My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying to make them speak of Mile. Swann’s parents and grandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann—when I talked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather’s business had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt Léonie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: ‘No, no, the business belonged to Swann’s father, that hedge is part of Swann’s park.’ And then I would be obliged to pause for breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts.
我姨妈没有去看树篱里的粉红山楂，但在一天中的任何时候，我都会问我的家人她是否不打算去，她是否曾经一度经常去坦森维尔，试图让他们谈论迈尔。斯旺的父母和祖父母在我看来就像神一样伟大和光荣。斯旺这个名字对我来说几乎成了神话——当我和家人交谈时，我会因为渴望听到他们说出这个名字而感到恶心；但我却无法理解。我自己不敢这么说，但我会吸引他们讨论一些自然而然会涉及希尔贝特和她的家人的问题，她也参与其中，说到这些，我会觉得自己并没有太远离她的陪伴；我会突然强迫我的父亲（例如，假装相信我祖父的生意在他去世之前就已经是我们家的了，或者我姨妈莱奥妮想要参观的粉红山楂树篱是有共同点的）纠正我的说法，好像反对我并自愿地说：“不，不，生意属于斯旺的父亲，那棵树篱是斯旺公园的一部分。”然后我不得不停下来喘口气。 ;当我听到这个名字的那一刻，我觉得它比任何其他名字都更充实、更不祥，因为它背负着沉重的负担，在我那永远铭刻着它的那部分上，压力是如此令人窒息。我曾在脑海中偷偷说过这句话的所有场合。它给我带来了一种快乐，而我却羞于敢于向父母要求这种快乐，因为为我获得这种快乐是多么伟大，他们必须付出巨大的努力，而且没有任何回报，因为对他们来说，声音中没有任何乐趣。 所以我会谨慎地转移话题。也是出于良心的顾忌。我在斯旺这个词的声音中储存的所有奇异的诱惑，当它被说出时，我又发现了。然后我突然想到，我的父母不可能不经历同样的情感，他们一定会发现自己分享我的观点，他们反过来也意识到了，他们宽恕了，他们甚至拥抱了我的幻想渴望，并且我真是可怜，仿佛我蹂躏和败坏了他们纯真的心灵。

That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my hair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville, bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and (like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her. ‘Oh, my poor little hawthorns,’ I was assuring them through my sobs, ‘it is not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you. You, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you.’ And, drying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.
那一年，我的家人比平常更早地确定了返回巴黎的日期。出发的那天早上，我把头发卷起来，准备面对摄影师，小心翼翼地戴上一顶新帽子，穿上天鹅绒夹克，把扣子扣好；过了一会儿，母亲四处寻找我，发现我泪流满面地站在坦森维尔附近那个陡峭的小山坡上，与我的山楂树告别，把它们锋利的枝条抱在怀里，（就像悲剧中的公主）被她所有毫无意义的珠宝的重量压得喘不过气来，对那只多管闲事的手毫无感激之情，这只手在卷起那些卷发时，煞费苦心地把我所有的头发都聚集在我的额头上；我把从头上撕下来的卷纸和我的新帽子踩在脚下。妈妈对我的眼泪一点也不感动，但看到我破烂的头饰和破烂的外套，她忍不住哭了。然而我没有听到她的声音。 “噢，我可怜的小山楂们，”我抽泣着向他们保证，“不是你们想让我不高兴，不是你们想让我离开你们。你，你从来没有伤害过我。所以我会永远爱你。”然后，我擦干眼睛，向他们保证，当我长大后，我永远不会效仿其他男人的愚蠢榜样，但即使在巴黎，在春光明媚的日子里，我也不会去打电话听着愚蠢的谈话，我会去乡间远足，去看第一批盛开的山楂树。

Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our Méséglise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had the wind for companion when one went the ‘Méséglise way,’ on that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu (Campus Pagani, according to the Curé). On my right I could see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of Saint-André-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated, honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.
一旦进入田野，我们在梅塞格利兹剩下的步行过程中就再也没有离开过它们。它们永远地穿过，就像看不见的车流和风一样，对我来说，风是贡布雷的守护神。每年，在我们到达的那天，为了感觉自己真的在贡布雷，我都会爬上山坡，发现它再次穿过我的衣服，让我在它的尾迹中奔跑。当人们沿着“梅塞格利斯之路”行走时，总会有风为伴，在那片绵延一英里的广阔平原上，没有任何扰乱其平缓轮廓的情况。我认识那位女士。斯旺经常去拉昂待几天，尽管距离很远，但由于没有任何中间障碍，这段距离就被消除了。在炎热的午后，我会看到一阵风从最远的地平线吹来，让远处田野里的玉米低下头，像洪水一样倾泻在这片广阔的土地上，最后在温暖而沙沙的声音中平静下来。三叶草和红枫就在我脚下，那片我们共同的平原似乎将我们吸引到一起，团结在一起。我会想象同样的气息也从她身边经过，在它对我耳语的声音中，有一些来自她的信息，但我无法理解它，当它经过时，我会抓住并亲吻它。我的左边是一个名叫尚皮厄（Champieu）的村庄（根据本堂神父的说法，是帕加尼校园）。在我的右边，我可以看到玉米地对面的圣安德烈德香教堂的两座粗犷的尖塔，它们本身就像两根麦穗一样逐渐变细、有鳞、有镀层、蜂窝状、泛黄、粗糙。

At regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the apple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging in shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going the ‘Méséglise way’ that I first noticed the circular shadow which apple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path.
每隔一段时间，苹果树就会露出它们那宽阔的白色缎子花瓣，或者羞涩地悬挂着一束束未开放的、红红的花蕾，这些叶子的装饰让人误以为是其他果树的叶子。正是在走“梅塞格利兹之路”时，我第一次注意到苹果树在阳光照射下投下的圆形影子，还有夕阳从树叶下斜垂下来的那些难以捉摸的金色丝线，我将它们看到我父亲用棍子砍过去，却没有让他们偏离正路。

Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to ‘come on’ for a while, and so goes ‘in front’ in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of art were very different—at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies—from those in which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have recognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine, some landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it enraged my grandmother’s sisters to see me admire. They held that one ought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one’s heart.
有时，午后的天空会出现一轮白月，像一片小云，鬼鬼祟祟、毫不张扬，暗示女演员暂时不必“上场”，就穿着平常的衣服走在“前面”观看。公司的其他人暂时离开了，但她留在了后台，不想引起自己的注意。我很高兴发现她的形象在书籍和绘画中得以再现，尽管这些艺术作品与那些月亮看起来很美丽的作品有很大不同——至少在我早年，在布洛赫使我的眼睛和思想适应更微妙的和谐之前。今天对我来说，但当时我不应该认出她。例如，可能是桑汀的某部小说，格莱尔的某幅风景画，其中她以银色镰刀的形式在天空中被锐利地剪裁，还有一些与当时一样简单和不完整的作品，我自己的印象，看到我钦佩，这激怒了我祖母的姐妹们。他们认为，应该把这样的书籍和图画摆在孩子们面前，让孩子们在欣赏时表现出他们与生俱来的良好品味，只有当他们的思想发展和成熟时，他们才会继续欣赏这样的书籍和图画。毫无疑问，他们把审美价值看成是一种物质性的东西，只要有清晰的视野就一定能够辨别出来，而不需要将其等同的生活经验储存在心中并慢慢成熟。

It was along the ‘Méséglise way,’ at Montjouvain, a house built on the edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: ‘That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about, and to let his daughter—a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense—bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold, and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter.’ But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart’s content the part of ‘double-dealer,’ a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Curé and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice: ‘What d’ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with her friend, Mile. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too, with his daughter’s friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say they’ve been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his feet.’
文特伊先生住在蒙茹万的“梅塞格利斯之路”沿线，这座房子建在一个大池塘的边缘，俯瞰着一座陡峭的灌木丛山。因此，我们经常见到他的女儿驾驶着狗车在路上全速行驶。某一年之后，我们再也没有单独见到过她，而是总是有一个朋友陪伴，一个比她年长的女孩，在邻里里享有恶名，最终有一天，她永久定居在蒙茹万。人们说：“那个可怜的万特伊先生一定是被爱情蒙蔽了双眼，看不到每个人都在谈论什么，而让他的女儿——一个如果你用错了这个词就会感到震惊的男人——把这样一个女人带到住在他的屋檐下。他说她是一位最优秀的女人，有一颗金子般的心，如果她接受过训练，她就会表现出非凡的音乐天赋。他可能确信她教他女儿的不是音乐。”但万特伊先生向他们保证，确实如此，而且确实值得注意的是，人们总是会引起与他们在一起的任何人的亲戚对他们正常品质的钦佩。是在身体交往中。肉体的激情受到如此不公正的谴责，却迫使其受害者表现出他们身上的每一处无私和慷慨的痕迹，而且如此有效，以至于他们在所有旁观者的眼中闪闪发光。珀塞皮德博士，他响亮的声音和浓密的眉毛使他能够尽情地扮演“两面派”的角色，否则他并不适应这个角色，但丝毫没有损害他无懈可击的、完全不值得的角色。一个心地善良、脾气暴躁的老头的名声，可能会让本堂神父和其他人都笑得哭起来，用严厉的声音说：“现在你对此说什么？” 她似乎和她的朋友迈尔一起演奏音乐。凡特伊。这让你感到惊讶，是吗？哦，我什么都不知道，什么都不知道。昨天是文特伊爸爸告诉我这一切的。毕竟，她完全有权利喜欢音乐，那个女孩。我决不应该梦想去阻碍一个孩子的艺术事业；看来凡特伊也不例外。然后他也和他女儿的朋友一起演奏音乐。哎呀，老天爷，外面那个房子一定是一个普通的音乐盒！你在笑什么？我说那些人，他们演奏的音乐太多了。前几天我在墓地遇见了文特伊爸爸。他所能做的就是保持站立。’

Anyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time, avoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a sea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughter’s happiness, spending whole days beside his wife’s grave, could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed, what his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil’s sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil may have known of his daughter’s conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of its physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in ‘low,’ in the very ‘lowest water,’ inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they might hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune.
任何人，像我们一样，在这个时候见过万特伊先生，避开他认识的人，一看到他们就转身走开，几个月后就变成了一个老人，沉浸在悲伤的海洋中。他无能为力，不直接为了促进女儿的幸福，整天守在妻子的坟墓旁，不可能不知道自己正在因心碎而逐渐死去，也不可能认为他对这些谣言毫不在意。正在发生的事情。他知道，也许他甚至相信他的邻居们在说什么。可能没有一个人，无论他的德行多么严格，他都会发现自己由于环境的复杂性而与他本人最直言不讳地谴责的恶习生活在一起，而没有首先在他的行为之下认识到它。它在进入他面前时所采取的伪装，以便伤害他并使他受苦；一天晚上，他对一个他有一千个理由去爱的人说的奇怪的话，不负责任的态度。但是，对于凡特伊先生这样敏感的人来说，必须屈从于一种被错误地认为只发生在波西米亚圈子里的情况，这一定比一个铁石心肠的人痛苦得多。因为每当需要在其发展所必需的安全感中建立一种恶习时，它们就会产生，这种恶习是大自然自己在孩子的灵魂中种植的，也许只不过是融合了父亲和母亲的美德，就像她可能融合了父母的美德一样。他们眼睛的颜色。然而，无论万特伊先生对女儿的行为了解多少，他对她的崇拜并没有因此而减少。 生活的事实并没有渗透到我们所珍视的信仰领域；因为这些信念不是他们产生的，所以他们无力摧毁它们。他们可以针对他们不断地进行矛盾和反驳的打击，但不会削弱他们；一场又一场的灾难和疾病接二连三地降临到一个家庭的怀抱中，不会使其对上帝的仁慈或医生的能力失去信心。但是，当万特伊先生从世界的角度和他们的声誉的角度来看待他的女儿和他自己时，当他试图将自己置于她身边时，他们在邻居的普遍评价中所占据的地位，那么他就他必须做出判断，以对他和他女儿最敌视的贡布雷居民所使用的措辞表达他自己和她的社会谴责；他看到自己和她都处于“低谷”，处于“最低的水域”，无法摆脱困境。他的举止近来带有一种谦逊的色彩，那种对地位高于他的人的尊重，而他现在必须仰视他们（无论他们迄今为止可能比他低得多），那种寻求某种重新崛起的方法的倾向达到他们的水平，这几乎是任何人类不幸的机械结果。

One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of Combray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and Swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who, amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another’s shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil, with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day, to play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier, would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting. Swann’s friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.
有一天，当我们和斯旺一起在贡布雷的一条街道上散步时，万特伊先生从另一条街道转出来，突然发现自己与我们所有人面对面，以至于他来不及逃脱；斯万，有着一个近乎傲慢的世俗人的仁慈，他在消除了自己所有的道德偏见的同时，在别人的耻辱中发现了一个以友好的仁慈对待他的理由，这种仁慈的外在迹象有助于增强和改善他的行为。满足赠与者的自尊心，因为他觉得这些东西对于被赠与者来说更加珍贵，与Vinteuil先生进行了长时间的交谈，很长一段时间以来，他与M. Vinteuil几乎没有交谈过，并且在离开我们之前邀请他有一天送他的女儿去坦森维尔玩。如果是两年前，这个邀请可能会激怒凡特伊先生，但现在他心中充满了感激之情，以至于他觉得自己有必要克制住，不要轻率地接受。在他看来，斯旺对女儿的友好关怀本身就是如此光荣，是对他的事业如此宝贵的支持，以至于他觉得最好不要使用它，这样才能获得完全柏拉图式的满足感，将其保留在其中。预订。

‘What a charming man!’ he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. ‘What a charming man! What a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!’
“多么有魅力的男人啊！”斯万走后，他对我们说，语气中充满了同样的热情和崇敬之情，这种热情和崇敬之情让聪明漂亮的中产阶级妇女成为公爵夫人身体和智力魅力的牺牲品，尽管她长得丑陋。和一个傻瓜。 ‘多么有魅力的男人啊！可惜他竟然缔结了如此悲惨的婚姻！

And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann’s marriage, invoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at Mont-jouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit Swann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly, after meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself, one of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil should appear with his daughter at Tansonville.
然后，即使是最真诚的人也有如此强烈的虚伪成分，他们在与任何人交谈时抛弃了他们对他的实际看法，并在他不再存在时表达出来，我的家人加入了与万特伊先生一起谴责斯旺的婚姻，援引原则和惯例（尤其是因为他们共同援引这些原则和惯例，就好像我们都是同类中的好伙伴一样），他们似乎认为这些原则和惯例决没有受到侵犯。蒙儒万。万特伊先生没有派他的女儿去看望斯旺，斯旺首先对这一疏忽感到遗憾。因为，在见到万特伊先生之后，他经常会记得自己很久以来就想向他打听某个与他同名的人，他的亲戚之一，斯万猜想。这次他决定，当万特伊先生带着他的女儿出现在坦森维尔时，他不会忘记他要对他说的话。

Since the ‘Méséglise way’ was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of Méséglise shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the fringe of Rous-sainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.
由于“梅塞格利斯路线”是我们过去在贡布雷周围散步的两条路线中较短的一条，因此，我们只在天气不稳定的日子里走，因此梅塞格利斯的气候出现了过高的降雨量，我们永远不会失去鲁桑维尔树林的边缘，这样我们就可以随时跑到茂密的茅草树叶下避难。

Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its roundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness, though not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village of Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from its perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses.
太阳常常会消失在云层后面，云层撞击着它的圆度，但太阳却将其边缘镀上金色。明亮的光线，虽然不是白昼的光，却会从一片风景中消失，所有的生命似乎都悬浮在其中，而鲁桑维尔的小村庄则以惊人的精确度，在天空上浮雕出白色的山墙。的细节。一阵风从栖息处吹来一只白嘴鸦，它飘走了，停在了远处，而在苍白的天空下，地平线上的树林呈现出更深的蓝色色调，仿佛它们是画在你仍然记得的那些浮雕上的。发现装饰老房子的墙壁。

But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the trees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last drops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we would emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now, among the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a stray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree.
但在其他日子里，会开始下雨，我们已经从眼镜制造商挂在门口的小气压计人物那里得到了适当的警告。它的水滴，就像候鸟在某个特定的时刻以身体飞翔一样，会以紧密的行进顺序从天空中落下。它们永远不会分开，不会在快速的航程中随意移动，但每一只都保持在自己的位置，会吸引紧随其后的水滴，天空会像南飞的燕子一样变暗。 。我们会躲在树林里。当他们的飞行似乎已经完成时，最后几滴，比其他的更微弱、更慢，仍然会落下来。但我们会从庇护所中出来，因为雨现在正在树枝之间玩游戏，而且，即使脚下几乎再次干燥，一两滴零散的水滴，在树叶的空洞中徘徊，也会流下来。从它的尖端悬挂下来，闪闪发光，直到突然它从树的整个高度溅到我们仰起的脸上。

Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, How typically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of Françoise. The sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil, precisely as Françoise in her kitchen would break into speech about Saint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to depreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered less ‘righteous.’ One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant (who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century) had of classical and of early Christian history, ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were derived not from books, but from a tradition at once ancient and direct, unbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray person whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic sculptures of Saint-André-des-Champs was young Théodore, the assistant in Camus’s shop. And, indeed, Françoise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill for Françoise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs and, perhaps, ‘make an impression’ on my aunt, she would send out for Théodore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a ‘bad character,’ was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due, in Franchise’s eyes, to all ‘poor invalids,’ and, above all, to her own ‘poor mistress,’ that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt’s head from her pillow, the same air of préraphaélite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the has-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of Théodore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples.
通常，我们也会急忙寻找庇护所，在所有石质圣徒和族长中间翻滚，进入圣安德烈德香教堂的门廊，那座教堂是多么典型的法国风格啊！门上刻着圣徒、手捧百合花的骑士国王、婚礼场景和葬礼的场景，就像弗朗索瓦丝脑海中的场景一样。雕塑家还记录了亚里士多德和维吉尔的某些轶事，正如弗朗索瓦丝在她的厨房里突然谈论圣路易斯，就好像她自己认识他一样，通常是为了与他相比，贬低我的祖父母，她认为他们是圣路易斯。人们可以看到中世纪艺术家和中世纪农民（他们在十九世纪幸存下来为我们做饭）对古典和早期基督教历史的看法，这些想法的不准确性被他们的诚实所弥补。简单性并非源自书本，而是源自一种既古老又直接、不间断、口头、退化、难以辨认却又鲜活的传统。在圣安德烈德尚的哥特式雕塑中，我也能辨认出另一个具有潜力和典型的贡布雷人物，那就是年轻的西奥多，他是加缪店里的助手。事实上，弗朗索瓦丝本人也很清楚，她是一个乡下人，也是一个当代人，因为当我姨妈病得太重，弗朗索瓦丝无法在没有帮助的情况下将她抱到床上或抱到椅子上时，让厨房女仆上楼来，也许可以给我姨妈“留下一个印象”，她会派人去找西奥多。 这个小伙子在镇上被认为是“坏人”，这是理所当然的，但他却充满了装饰圣安德烈教堂门廊的那种精神，特别是在感情上在弗兰奇斯看来，这是对所有“可怜的病人”，尤其是她自己的“可怜的情妇”的尊重，当他弯下腰把我姨妈的头从枕头上抬起来时，他也表现出同样的普雷拉斐埃式的朴素态度。浮雕中的小天使们所表现出的热情，他们手里拿着蜡烛，聚集在圣母临终的床边，仿佛那些石刻的面孔，像冬天的树木一样赤裸和灰色，就像他们一样，只是睡着了，储存着生命，等待着在无数平民的脸上再次绽放，像西奥多的脸一样可敬而狡猾，闪烁着成熟苹果的红润光彩。

There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there—as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone—seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar.
在那里，也没有像小天使那样固定在墙上，而是脱离了门廊，比人类身材高大，竖立在她的基座上，就像脚凳一样，放置在那里是为了避免她的脚接触潮湿的地面站着一位圣人，脸颊丰满，衣幔内鼓起的坚挺乳房像袋子里的一串成熟的葡萄，窄额头，短而顽固的鼻子，深陷的眼睛，坚强，厚皮，勇敢这些地区的乡村妇女的表达。这种相似性给雕像本身带来了一种我没有在其中寻找的亲切感，经常有一些女孩从田野里来到门廊下，像我们一样来到门廊下避难，她们的存在——就像当攀援植物的叶子长在石头雕刻的叶子旁边时——命运似乎有意让我们通过面对它的本质类型，对艺术作品的真实性形成批判性的评估。在我们的眼前，在远处，一片应许之地或被诅咒的土地，鲁桑维尔，我从未进入过它的城墙，当雨停了，我们的鲁桑维尔现在仍然受到惩罚，就像《旧约》中的一个村庄一样，暴风雨中无数的矛和箭，倾斜地袭击了居民的住所，或者已经得到了全能者的宽恕，他恢复了他的阳光，阳光照在它身上。长度不均匀，就像祭坛上圣体圣体的光线。

Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in a landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere, resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the fluid and unstable ‘fine weather’ of winter, its very opposite, in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white. Sitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner with a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather’s continuing; it might rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville, there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees.
有时，天气完全坏了，我们就不得不回家，把自己关在室内。远处，在昏暗的光线和饱和的气氛中，在一片风景中，几座孤零零的房子紧贴在一座小山的较低斜坡上，这些房子的高度被埋在阴暗的黑暗中，闪闪发光，像海景一样。小船收起帆，整夜在海上抛锚航行。但下雨还是暴风雨又有什么关系呢？夏季，恶劣的天气只不过是表面上的坏脾气，由永久的、潜在的好天气所表现出来的。这与冬天多变且不稳定的“好天气”截然不同，事实上，情况恰恰相反；因为它不是（牢固地扎根在土壤中，在土壤上以茂密的树叶形成坚固的形状，雨水可以倾盆而下，而不会削弱它们真正和持久的幸福所提供的阻力）被悬挂起来，让它们在整个过程中飞行这个季节，在村庄的街道上，在房屋的墙壁上和花园里，它的丝绸横幅，紫色和白色。 坐在小客厅里，我会一边看书一边消磨晚餐时间，我可能会听到栗子树上滴下的水声，但我知道，淋浴只会给栗子树上厚厚的、皱巴巴的叶子增添光泽和绿色。 ，他们自己也承诺要留在那里，就像夏天的誓言一样，整个雨夜，向我保证好天气会持续下去；可能会下雨，但明天，在坦森维尔的白色栅栏上，将会像往常一样涌动和流动，一片小小的心形叶子的海洋；我毫无焦虑地看着佩尔尚街的白杨树在暴风雨前绝望地低头祈求怜悯。我毫不担心地听到，在花园的尽头，最后的雷声在我们的紫丁香树上咆哮。

If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of a walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit of going out by myself on such days, and walking towards Méséglise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray to settle the division of my aunt Léonie’s estate; for she had died at last, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise—those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary, but organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it; causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that one a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my aunt’s last illness Françoise never went out of her room for an instant, never took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave. Then, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Françoise had lived of my aunt’s harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which was really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The time had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Franchise’s eyes, with my aunt.
如果整个早上天气都不好，家人就会放弃散步的想法，我就留在家里。但后来，我养成了在这样的日子里独自出去的习惯，在那个秋天，当我们不得不来贡布雷解决我姨妈莱奥妮庄园的分割问题时，我走向梅塞格利塞拉维讷斯。因为她最终死了，邻居中的双方都因她的死亡而得意洋洋——那些坚持认为她的生活方式令人衰弱并最终必须杀死她的人，以及那些一直认为她遭受痛苦的人某种疾病不是虚构的，而是有机的，一旦她屈服于这种疾病，即使是最持怀疑态度的人也不得不承认自己确信自己患有这种疾病；除了她的一名幸存者之外，没有对任何人造成强烈的悲伤，但对那个幸存者来说，其暴力却是一种悲伤的野蛮。在我姨妈最后一次生病的漫长两周里，弗朗索瓦丝从未离开过她的房间，从未脱掉衣服，不允许任何人为我姨妈做任何事，直到她的尸体真正进入坟墓才离开她的身体。后来，我们终于明白，弗朗索瓦丝对姨妈的严厉言辞、猜疑和愤怒所感到的恐惧，在她身上发展出了一种情感，我们误以为是仇恨，而这实际上是崇敬和爱。她真正的情妇，她的决定是不可能预见的，她的计谋是那么难以逃脱，她的善良本性是那么容易被利用，她的主权，她神秘而无所不能的君主已经不复存在了。与这样的情妇相比，我们实在是微不足道。 当我们第一次来贡布雷度假时，在弗兰奇斯看来，我们和姨妈同等重要，那段日子早已过去了。

During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with solicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it happened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them, along the ‘Méséglise way,’ wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which protected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised Françoise, whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of one’s clothes had nothing whatever to do with one’s mourning for the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt’s death was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I am sure that in a book—and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of Françoise—such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the Chanson de Roland and of the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, would have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Françoise herself approached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry, and I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I regretted my aunt’s death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moment’s sorrow; statements which, in a book, would have struck me as merely fatuous.
那年秋天，我的父母发现这些日子都忙于必须办理的法律手续以及与律师和农民的讨论，以至于他们几乎没有时间散步，而碰巧天气变得不稳定，他们开始让我走吧，没有他们，沿着“梅塞格利斯之路”，裹着一件巨大的高地格子呢，它可以保护我免受雨淋，我更愿意把它披在肩上，因为我觉得它华丽的条纹格子呢让弗朗索瓦丝感到震惊，她无法相信衣服的颜色与对死者的哀悼毫无关系，而我们对姨妈去世所表现出的悲伤完全不能令她满意，因为我们没有接受邻居们参加了一场盛大的葬礼宴会，当我们谈论她时，并没有采取特殊的语气，而有时可能会听到我哼着小调。我相信，在一本书中——在某种程度上，我的感受与弗朗索瓦丝的感受非常相似——这种哀悼的概念，以罗兰之歌和圣安德烈德香的门廊的方式，会看起来最有吸引力。但当弗朗索瓦丝本人走近时，某种邪灵就会怂恿我试图激怒她，我就会利用一点借口对她说，我对姨妈的死感到遗憾，因为她是一个好女人，尽管她是个好女人。她的荒谬之处，但绝不是因为她是我的姨妈；她很可能是我的姨妈，但却如此可憎，以至于她的死不会给我带来片刻的悲伤；如果放在书中，我会觉得这些言论纯粹是愚蠢的。

And if Françoise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: ‘I don’t know how to espress myself’—I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: ‘All the same she was a geological relation; there is always the respect due to your geology,’ I would shrug my shoulders and say: ‘It is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language,’ adopting, to deliver judgment on Françoise, the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life.
如果弗朗索瓦丝当时像一位诗人一样受到启发，对丧亲之痛、悲伤和家庭记忆进行了大量混乱的思考，她辩解说她无法反驳我的理论，说：“我不知道如何表达自己”——我会以佩尔塞皮德博士的讽刺和残酷的常识战胜了她；如果她继续说：“尽管如此，她还是一个地质关系；”我会耸耸肩说：“能与一位不会说自己语言的文盲老妇人讨论这个问题，真是太好了。”弗朗索瓦丝，学究的卑鄙和狭隘的观点，那些在自己思想的公正性上最蔑视他的人，当他们不得不在庸俗的生活舞台上扮演角色时，他们很容易效仿他。

My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used to take them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of reading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was now obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in every direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its back, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must hear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day, rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation, found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet. And so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted. When I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the ‘Méséglise way,’ all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression. After an hour of rain and wind, against which I had put up a brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil’s gardener kept his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall, and the chicken’s downy feathers, both of which things let themselves float upon the wind’s breath to their full extent, with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never observed before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the wall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: ‘Damn, damn, damn, damn!’ But at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment.
那年秋天，我的散步更加令人愉快，因为我常常在长时间看书后散步。当我在家里呆了一上午，读累了的时候，我就会把格子布披在肩上，然后出发。我的身体在长期的强制不动中积累了生命能量，现在不得不像陀螺一样受伤并释放，将其消耗在各个方向。房屋的墙壁，坦森维尔的树篱，鲁桑维尔树林的树木，蒙茹万靠背的灌木丛，都必须承受我的手杖或雨伞的打击，必须听到我幸福的呼喊，打击和呼喊确实不存在不仅仅是表达让我兴奋的混乱想法，而且这些想法还没有发展到可以暴露在阳光下的程度，而不是接受缓慢而困难的阐明过程，发现它更容易和更愉快漂流到一个直接的出口。因此，我们内心深处感觉的大部分情感表现只不过是让我们减轻这些感觉的负担，让它们以一种模糊的形式从我们身边逃脱，而这种形式并没有告诉我们应该如何处理这些感觉。被解释。当我试图计算我对“梅塞格利兹方式”的所有贡献时，所有这些卑微的发现要么是偶然的背景，要么是直接的灵感和原因，我想起那是在同一个秋天，那些散步，靠近从后方守护着蒙茹万的茂密悬崖，我第一次对我们的印象与正常表达形式之间的不和谐感到震惊。 经过一个小时的风雨交加，我奋力抵抗，来到了蒙茹万池塘边，来到了一座瓦屋顶的小茅屋，万特伊先生的园丁在里面存放着他的工具，太阳又出来了，被阵雨洗干净的金色光芒，再次在天空、树上、小屋的墙上、屋顶上仍然湿漉漉的瓦片上闪耀，屋顶上栖息着一只鸡。它的山脊。风把长在墙上的野草和鸡的绒毛吹到一边，这两种东西都让自己充分地漂浮在风的呼吸中，带着光和无生命物质的不可抗拒的顺从。瓦片屋顶投射在池塘上，池塘的倒影现在在阳光下又清晰可见，是一块粉红色的大理石正方形，我以前从未见过这样的地方。看到水面倒映着墙壁，苍白的微笑回应着微笑的天空，我挥舞着卷起的雨伞，激动地大声喊道：“该死，该死，该死，该死！”我觉得我有责任不满足于这些没有启发性的话语，而应该努力更清楚地看到我的快乐的来源。

And it was at that moment, too—thanks to a peasant who went past, apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality to my ‘Fine day, what! good to be out walking!’—that I learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that, whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them with a kiss.
也是在那个时刻——感谢一位走过的农民，他的心情显然已经够糟糕的了，但当他几乎把我的雨伞挡在他脸上时，他的心情更加糟糕，他毫无热情地回答我“美好的一天，什么！出去散步真好！”——我了解到，按照预先设定的顺序，相同的情绪不会同时出现在所有人的心中。后来我发现，每当我读了太久，有心情交谈时，我迫不及待想要说些什么的朋友此时已经沉浸在交谈的乐趣中，什么也不想了。但要不受干扰地阅读。如果我怀着对父母的感情，并制定出最明智、最恰当的计划来给他们带来快乐，他们就会利用同样的时间来发现我已经忘记的一些错误行为，并开始责骂我。严厉地对待我，就像我扑向他们亲吻一样。

Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in the woman’s charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any bounds. Moreover—just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be—the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of ‘woman,’ but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from Méséglise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for Balbec and Méséglise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from Méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman’s company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon us.
有时，除了独处带来的兴奋之外，还会有另一种感觉，以致于我心里不知道该投决定性的一票；一种渴望看到一个农家女孩出现在我眼前，我可以将她抱在怀里的愿望所激发的感觉。伴随着这种欲望的快乐似乎只比我的其他想法所给我的快乐来得突然，而且没有给我时间在这么多不同种类的想法中准确地追踪它的来源。我发现此刻我脑海中的一切都有额外的优点，瓦片屋顶的粉红色反射，墙上的野草，我一直渴望深入的鲁桑维尔村庄，它的树林教堂的尖塔，是由这种新鲜的情感在他们身上创造出来的，这使他们显得更令人向往，只是因为我认为是他们挑起了它，而且当它充满我的风帆时，它似乎只是希望带我更快地走向他们伴随着一股强大的、未知的、吉祥的微风。但是，如果这种对女人出现的渴望为我增添了比自然魅力更崇高的东西，那么它们反过来又放大了我在女人的魅力中可能发现的太多限制。在我看来，树木的美丽也是她的，至于那些地平线的精神，鲁桑维尔村庄的精神，以及我当年读过的书籍的精神，正是她的吻使我成为主人他们所有人中;而且，我的想象力从与我的肉欲的接触中汲取力量，我的肉欲扩展到我想象的所有领域，我的欲望不再有任何界限。 此外，正如在沉思冥想自然的时刻，心灵的正常活动被暂停，我们对事物的抽象观念被置于一侧，我们以最深刻的信念相信原创性，相信这个地方的个体存在。我们可能碰巧就是这样——我的欲望唤起的路过的形象似乎不是“女人”一般类型的任何一个例子，而是土壤的必然和自然产物。因为那时，除我之外的一切，大地及其上的生物，对我来说似乎比对成年人来说更珍贵，更重要，被赋予了更真实的存在。我对地球和地球上的生物没有区别。我对来自梅塞格利塞或鲁桑维尔的农家女孩有一种渴望，对来自巴尔贝克的渔女有一种渴望，就像我对巴尔贝克和梅塞格利兹有一种渴望一样。如果我可以自由地根据自己的选择修改其条件，那些女孩有权给予我的快乐似乎就不那么真诚了，我应该不再相信它了。在巴黎遇见一位来自巴尔贝克的渔女或一位来自梅塞格利兹的农家姑娘，就像收到一份我在海滩上从未见过的贝壳礼物，或者是我从未在树林中发现过的蕨类礼物一样，她原本要给我的快乐被我的想象所包裹的所有其他快乐都剥夺了。但是，在没有农家姑娘拥抱的情况下，在鲁桑维尔的树林里漫步，就等于看到了那些树林，却对它们的秘密宝藏、它们深藏的美丽一无所知。 那个我从未见过的女孩，除了树叶的影子斑驳，对我来说，她本身就是一种当地生长的植物，只是比其他植物高，她的结构使我比她们更接近于亲密的味道。她出生的土地。我更容易相信这一点（而且她给我带来那种味道的爱抚本身就是一种特殊的，产生一种除了她以外我无法从任何人那里得到的快乐），因为我是静止的，而且必须长期存在，在生命的那个时期，当一个人还没有将这种感官愉悦的事实与那些与他一起品尝过这种愉悦的各种女人分开时，当一个人还没有将它简化为一种使人从那时起就可以看待她们的普遍观念时作为总是相同的乐趣的可变工具。事实上，这种快乐并不存在，在意识中被孤立和表述，作为一个人寻求女人陪伴的最终目标，或者作为一个人在预期中感到不安的原因。人们甚至很少想到自己，只想到如何逃离自己。隐晦地等待着，内在的和隐藏的，它唤醒了这样一种突发，当它最终让自己感觉到的那一刻，我们在温柔的目光中，在我们身边的她的亲吻中发现了其他的快乐，似乎对我们来说，最重要的是，这是一种对我们伴侣的善良之心和她对我们自己的感人偏爱的感激之情，我们通过她给我们带来的好处和幸福来衡量这一点。

Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville, that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village, appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my earliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from the little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen nothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window, while, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of my own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even—until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I might go alone as far as the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs: never did I find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with my grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix my eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time.
唉，我徒劳地恳求鲁桑维尔的地牢要塞，恳求它派出村里的某个女儿来见我，恳求它把我最早的愿望告诉给它，当时，从我们位于贡布雷的房子的顶楼，从那间散发着鸢尾草根气味的小房间里，我向外张望，除了它的塔楼什么也没看到，塔楼被框在半开的窗户的方形框架中，同时，带着英勇的顾虑一个出发去未知地方的旅行者，或者一个在自我毁灭边缘犹豫不决、情绪激动的绝望不幸者，我跨越自己经验的界限，探索了一条人迹罕至的道路，我相信，这条道路可能会引导我到达我的目标。死亡，甚至——直到激情消退，让我在开花的醋栗花丛中颤抖，它们从窗户爬进来，在我的全身上下翻滚。我现在呼吁它是徒劳的。我徒劳地将整个景观压缩到我的视野中，用彻底的凝视将其吸干，试图从中提取出一个雌性生物。我可能会独自走到圣安德烈德香的门廊：如果我和祖父在一起的话，我一定会在那里遇到那个女孩，但我却无法与她交谈。 我会不受时间限制地把目光固定在远处一棵树的树干上，她一定会从树后出现并向我跳来。我仔细观察，发现地平线和以前一样荒芜。夜幕降临了；现在，我毫无希望地集中注意力，仿佛要将那些必须隐藏在这片贫瘠的土地上、那片陈腐而陈旧的土地上的生物赶出来；我不再是心情轻松，而是带着闷闷不乐的愤怒，向鲁桑维尔树林中的树木挥拳，其中没有更多的生物出现，就像它们是画在全景画布背景上的树木一样那时，我无法接受自己必须回家，而没有把我如此渴望的女人抱在怀里，我不得不折回我的脚步，走向贡布雷，并向自己承认，她出现在我路上的机会每时每刻都在变小。如果她出现了，我还敢跟她说话吗？我觉得她会认为我疯了，因为我不再考虑那些在散步时出现但从未实现的欲望，这些欲望是与他人分享的，或者是除了我自己之外的任何存在。现在看来，它们只不过是我性格中纯粹主观、无能、虚幻的生物。它们现在与自然、与真实事物的世界没有任何联系，从现在起，它们就失去了所有的魅力和意义，对我的生活来说只不过是一个纯粹的传统框架，就像一部小说的情节是被框架的一样。火车车厢里，一个旅客在座位上阅读这本书来打发时间。

And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at Mont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel side of human passion called ‘sadism.’ We shall see, in due course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mile. Vinteuil (or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her.
也许是几年后我在蒙儒万得到的另一种印象，这种印象在当时毫无意义，很久以后，我就产生了关于人类激情的残酷一面的想法，即“施虐狂”。在适当的时候，我们将会看到，出于另一个原因，这种印象的记忆在我的生活中发挥着重要作用。当时天气非常炎热。我的父母不得不离开一整天，他们告诉我，我可以在外面呆到很晚，想呆多久就呆多久。一直走到蒙茹万池塘，在那里我再次欣赏小屋瓦顶的倒影，我躺在树荫下，在屋后陡峭斜坡上的灌木丛中睡着了，几年前，有一天他们去拜访凡特伊先生时，我就在这儿等过父母。当我醒来时，天已经快黑了，我想起身走开，但我看到了迈尔。 Vinteuil（或者至少我认为我认出了她，因为我在贡布雷不常见到她，而且只是在她还是个孩子的时候，而她现在正长成一个年轻女子），她可能刚刚进来，站在我面前，离我只有几英尺远，在她父亲招待我的那个房间里，她现在把它变成了自己的小客厅。窗户半开着；灯亮了；我可以观察她的一举一动，而她却看不到我；但是，如果我走开，我一定会在灌木丛中发出沙沙的声音，她会听到我的声音，并可能认为我躲在那里是为了监视她。

She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence—namely, modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My mother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil’s life, his complete absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old man’s face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts’ old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father. ‘Poor M. Vinteuil,’ my mother would say, ‘he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only come to him from her.’
她沉浸在深深的悲痛之中，因为她的父亲刚刚去世。我们没有去看她；我们没有去看她。我母亲本来不想去，因为她唯一的美德限制了她的仁慈，那就是谦虚；但她却从心底里怜悯这个女孩。我母亲没有忘记万特伊先生一生的悲惨结局，他全神贯注，首先是他女儿的母亲和保姆，后来是她给他带来的痛苦；她可以看到老人脸上在可怕的最后几年里从未消失过的痛苦表情。她知道他肯定放弃了以公平的副本抄写他后来的全部作品的任务，我们想象的是一位老音乐大师、一位退休乡村风琴师的可怜的小作品，我们认为这些作品几乎没有什么意义。它们本身没有任何价值，尽管我们并不鄙视它们，因为它们对他来说具有如此巨大的价值，并且在他将它们牺牲给他的女儿之前一直是他生活的主要动机。这些片段大多没有被写下来，而只记录在他的记忆中，而其余的则潦草地写在松散的纸上，而且非常难以辨认，现在一定永远不为人知了；我母亲还想到了万特伊先生所被迫做出的另一种更为残酷的放弃，即看到这个女孩幸福地安顿下来，拥有一个诚实而体面的未来。当她回想起发生在我姨妈们的老音乐老师身上的所有这些彻底的、令人心碎的痛苦时，她感到非常真实的悲伤，想到另一种悲伤，她感到不寒而栗，她的痛苦是如此不同，而她的痛苦却是如此不同。万特伊现在肯定对自己实际上杀死了父亲感到懊悔。 ‘可怜的M。 凡特伊，”我母亲会说，“他为他的女儿而活，现在他为她而死，却没有得到任何回报。我想知道他现在会得到它吗？以什么形式？这只能从她那里得到。’

At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil’s sitting-room, on the mantelpiece, stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch, just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside, then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil had ‘placed’ beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to ‘make room.’ But no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.
在 Mlle 的尽头。万特伊起居室的壁炉架上放着一张她父亲的小照片，正当外面的马路传来马车车轮的声音时，她快步去拿照片，然后一屁股坐在沙发上，靠近她身边。她把照片放在一张小桌子上，就像很久以前，万特伊先生在他旁边“放”了一首他想给我父母演奏的音乐一样。然后她的朋友进来了。Mlle。凡特伊没有起身向她打招呼，她双手抱在脑后，把身体拉到沙发的一侧，好像是在“腾出空间”。但她一这样做，似乎就觉得自己也许是在建议对她朋友的特殊立场，并强调很可能被认为是纠缠不休。她认为，毫无疑问，她的朋友更愿意坐在离她有一段距离的椅子上。她觉得自己很不检点；她敏感的心受到了惊吓；她再次把身子伸到整个沙发上，闭上眼睛，开始打哈欠，以表明她想睡觉，也正是因为这个原因，她才躺在那里。尽管她对待她的同伴粗鲁而咄咄逼人，但我还是能从她身上看出她的谄媚和沉默寡言，以及她父亲特有的突然的顾忌和克制。不久，她站起身来，来到窗前，假装想关上百叶窗，但没有成功。

‘Leave them open,’ said her friend. ‘I am hot.’
“让它们敞开，”她的朋友说。 “我很热。”

‘But it’s too dreadful! People will see us,’ Mlle. Vinteuil answered. And then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful, when she hastily went on: ‘When I say ‘see us’ I mean, of course, see us reading. It’s so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you.’
‘但这也太可怕了！人们会看到我们，”女士。凡特伊回答道。然后她猜想，她的朋友可能会认为她说出这些话只是为了激起其他某些话的答复，她似乎确实希望听到别人说这些话，但出于谨慎，会让她这样说。朋友第一个发言。因此，虽然我看不清她的脸，但我确信她的脸上一定出现了我祖母曾经感到如此愉快的表情，当时她急忙继续说：“当我说‘见我们’时，我的意思是，当然，看我们读书。想到在你做的每一件微不足道的小事中，有人可能会忽视你，真是太可怕了。”

With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.
她出于本能的慷慨，出于她无法控制的礼貌，没有说出那些她认为对于完全实现她的愿望必不可少的深思熟虑的话。永远，在她内心深处，一个害羞而恳求的少女会跪在另一个元素面前，那个老竞选者，饱受打击但胜利，会向他求情并迫使他退休。

‘Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district!’ said her friend, with bitter irony. ‘And what if they are?’ she went on, feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. ‘And what if they are? All the better that they should see us.’
“哦，是的，在这个人口稠密的地区，在深夜的这个时候，人们极有可能会看着我们！”她的朋友讽刺地说。 “如果是的话呢？”她继续说道，觉得自己必须用恶意而深情的眨眼来注释她出于善意而重复的这些话，就像事先准备好的一堂课，她知道，这会让小姐高兴。凡特伊听到。 ‘如果是的话怎么办？他们能看到我们就更好了。

Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself with: ‘You’re sure you aren’t cold? You aren’t too hot? You don’t want to sit and read by yourself?...
女士。凡特伊颤抖着站了起来。在她敏感而谨慎的心里，她不知道应该从她的嘴唇中自发地说出什么话，以产生她急切的感官所渴望的场景。她尽可能地跨越自己真实性格的限制，寻找适合她渴望被认为是邪恶的年轻女子的语言，但她想象这样一个年轻女子可能会真诚地说出的话在她自己的嘴里听起来不真实。她只允许自己说的那一点点，都是用一种紧张的语气说的，她根深蒂固的胆怯使她的自由和大胆言论的倾向瘫痪了。而她却不断地打断自己：“你确定你不冷吗？”你是不是太热了？你不想一个人坐着看书吗？...

‘Your ladyship’s thoughts seem to be rather ‘warm’ this evening,’ she concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some earlier occasion, by her friend.
“今晚，夫人的思绪似乎相当‘温暖’，”她总结道，毫无疑问地重复了她在早些时候听过她的朋友说过的一句话。

In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting of her friend’s sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old music-master’s portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time: ‘Oh! there’s my father’s picture looking at us; I can’t think who can have put it there; I’m sure I’ve told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it.’
在她的绉纱紧身胸衣的 V 形开口中，Mlle。芬特伊感受到了她朋友突然的吻的刺痛。她尖叫了一声，就跑开了。然后他们开始在房间里互相追逐，在家具上爬来爬去，宽大的袖子像翅膀一样飘动，像一对多情的小鸟一样咯咯地叫着。最后，小姐。凡特伊精疲力尽地倒在沙发上，她朋友弯腰的身体挡住了我的视线。但后者现在背对着那张小桌子，上面摆着老音乐大师的肖像。女士。万特伊意识到，除非她的注意力被吸引，否则她的朋友不会看到它，于是惊呼道，就好像她自己第一次注意到它一样：“哦！我父亲的照片正在看着我们；我想不出是谁把它放在那里的；我确信我已经告诉他们二十次了，那不是合适的地方。”

I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response: ‘Let him stay there. He can’t trouble us any longer. D’you think he’d start whining, d’you think he’d pack you out of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?’
我想起了万特伊先生为一张碍眼的乐谱向我父母道歉时所说的话。当然，这张照片在他们的仪式中很常见，但每天都受到亵渎，因为朋友的回答显然是一种礼拜仪式：“让他留在那里。”他不能再给我们添麻烦了。你认为如果他现在能看到你，窗户开着，这只丑陋的老猴子，你认为他会开始抱怨，你认为他会把你赶出房子吗？

To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, ‘Oh, please!’—a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl’s head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.
女士。凡特伊回答道：“哦，拜托！”——这是一种温和的责备，这证明了她本性的真正善良，而不是因为听到她父亲以这种方式被谈论而产生的任何怨恨（因为这显然是她的一种感觉）她通过长期的诡辩训练自己在这种时刻保持密切的服从），而是因为她自己用缰绳来约束她的朋友试图获得的满足，以避免一切自私的表现。为她采购。也很可能是因为她面对和回答这些亵渎行为时所表现出的温和而温和的态度，这种温柔而虚伪的指责在她坦率而慷慨的本性看来是一种特别可耻和诱人的犯罪态度，因为她对生活抱有一种罪恶的态度。努力采纳。但她无法抗拒被一个刚刚对毫无防备的死者表现出如此无情的女人所充满爱意的吸引力。她跳到朋友的膝盖上，伸出纯洁的额头让他亲吻。就像一个女儿对她母亲所做的那样，她怀着无比喜悦的心情，想到他们将在他们之间施展最后的残忍手段，抢劫万特伊先生，就好像他们实际上是在掏空他的坟墓一样。父亲的神圣权利。她的朋友双手捧着女孩的头，顺从地在她的额头上印下一吻，这是出于她对小姐的真挚感情。 Vinteuil，以及她想为一个孤儿的沉闷而忧郁的生活带来尽可能多的干扰的愿望。

‘Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?’ she said, taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil’s ear something that I could not distinguish.
“你知道我应该对那个古老的恐怖做什么吗？”她拿起照片说道。她用“小姐”的声音低声说道。万特伊的耳朵有些我无法辨别的东西。

‘Oh! You would never dare.’
'哦！你永远不敢。

‘Not dare to spit on it? On that?’ shouted the friend with deliberate brutality.
‘不敢吐口水吗？就这个？”朋友故意粗暴地喊道。

I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward, preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.
我再也没有听到小姐的消息了。万特伊现在显得疲惫、尴尬、心事重重、真诚，而且相当悲伤，他回到窗前，把百叶窗关上。但我现在知道了，万特伊先生在他一生中为他的女儿所遭受的所有痛苦，在他死后从她那里得到了什么回报。

And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter’s soundness of heart, and that he might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that in all Mlle. Vinteuil’s actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a ‘sadist’; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the ‘sadic’ instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least inclined towards ‘sadism,’ a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle. Vinteuil’s soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was probably not unmixed. A’sadist’ of her kind is an artist in evil, which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in their profanation. ‘Sadists’ of Mlle. Vinteuil’s sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother’s blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father’s memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty.
然而我后来反思，如果万特伊先生能够在场，他可能仍然会，不管发生什么，继续相信他女儿的内心健全，他甚至可能，在这样的情况下，这样做，并没有完全错误。确实如此，在所有 Mlle 中。凡特伊的行为中邪恶的表现是如此强烈和一致，以至于除了现在所谓的“虐待狂”之外，很难发现它如此完整地表现出来。在巴黎剧院的脚灯后面，而不是在真正的乡间别墅的朴素灯光下，人们期望看到一个女孩带领着她的朋友向一位无缘无故地生和死的父亲的肖像吐口水。除了她自己之外，还有一个人；当我们在现实生活中发现对戏剧效果的渴望时，通常是“施虐”本能造成的。一个女孩即使没有丝毫“施虐狂”的倾向，也有可能表现出与女士一样的令人发指的残忍行为。凡特伊亵渎了记忆，违背了她已故父亲的意愿，但她不会在象征意义如此粗鲁、如此缺乏微妙的行为中故意表达它们；她的行为中的犯罪成分对其他人甚至她自己来说都不太明显，因为她不会向自己承认自己做错了。但是，除了外表之外，在 Mlle 中。凡特伊的灵魂，至少在前期，恐怕不乏邪恶的成分。 她这一类的“虐待狂”是邪恶的艺术家，而一个完全邪恶的人不可能是这样，因为在那种情况下，邪恶就不是外在的，对她来说似乎很自然，甚至无法区分来自她自己；至于美德、对死者的尊重、孝顺，因为她永远不会崇拜这些东西，所以她不会因为这些东西的亵渎而感到不虔诚的快乐。女士的“虐待狂”。凡特伊之类的人是纯粹感伤的生物，天性如此善良，以至于连感官上的快乐在他们看来都是坏事，是恶人的特权。当他们允许自己暂时享受它时，他们会努力模仿，为自己和有罪的伙伴呈现出恶人的所有外表，以便获得暂时的幻觉，以为自己逃脱了自己的控制。温柔而一丝不苟的本性进入了非人的快乐世界。当我意识到她不可能实现这样的逃脱时，我能理解她一定多么渴望这样的逃脱。当她希望被认为是她父亲的对立面时，她立即向我暗示的是这位可怜的老音乐大师在思想和言语上的举止。事实上，他的照片算不了什么；她真正亵渎的东西，她为了满足她的快乐而堕落的东西，但在他们和她之间，阻止她直接享受这些快乐的，是她的脸和他的脸，他母亲的蓝眼睛之间的相似之处，这是他遗传给他的。她，就像家里保留的一件小饰品，那些小小的友好动作和倾向，在小姐的恶毒之间建立起来。 凡特伊和她自己都是一种措辞，一种不为罪恶而设计的心态，这使她认为这与她每天必须致力于的无数的社会责任和礼节没有任何不同。并不是邪恶给她带来了快乐的想法，对她来说，快乐是有吸引力的；而是邪恶的。相反，这似乎是一种快乐，看起来是邪恶的。每当她沉溺其中时，快乐就会伴随着邪恶的思想而来，而这些邪恶的思想通常在她善​​良的心灵中是没有地位的，所以她最终在快乐本身中看到了一些恶魔般的东西，并将其与邪恶等同起来。也许女士。凡特伊觉得，她的朋友内心并不全是坏人，在说出那些亵渎的话时也并不真诚。无论如何，她很高兴能收到额头上的那些吻、那些微笑、那些目光；或许，所有的一切都是假装的，但其卑鄙而恶毒的表达方式类似于那些在一个不是出于仁慈和长期忍耐，而是出于自我放纵和残忍的生物的脸上可以辨别出来的表情。她有那么一会儿欺骗自己，相信自己确实是在自娱自乐，就像一个女孩在与如此不自然的共犯一起自娱自乐时，她确实对父亲的记忆经历了野蛮的反感。如果她能够像她所有的男女同胞一样，在自己身上辨别出那种冷漠，也许她就不会认为邪恶是一种如此罕见、如此异常、如此奇异、令人耳目一新的状态。他们所造成的痛苦，无论被赋予什么其他名称，都是一种真正的、可怕的和持久的残忍形式。

If the ‘Méséglise way’ was so easy, it was a very different matter when we took the ‘Guermantes way,’ for that meant a long walk, and we must make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days, when Françoise, in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the ‘poor crops,’ gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: ‘You would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!’—when my father’s appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner: ‘To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way.’ And off we would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing, I pierce through it and ‘restore’ the Rue des Perchamps. And for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it has preserved—perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon to follow the rest into oblivion—of what Combray looked like in my childhood’s days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as moving—if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works, reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me—as those old engravings of the ‘Cenacolo,’ or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark’s.
如果“梅塞格利兹之路”这么容易，那么当我们走“盖尔芒特之路”时，情况就完全不同了，因为这意味着要走很长一段路，而且我们首先必须确定天气。当我们似乎进入了一段美好的日子时，当弗朗索瓦丝绝望地没有一滴水落在“贫瘠的庄稼”上时，她抬头凝视天空，只见天空上飘浮着一小朵白云。平静、蔚蓝的水面，大声呻吟着，惊呼道：“你会说它们只不过是一群在游来游去、伸出鼻子的角鲨！”啊，他们从来没有想过为可怜的劳动者下一点雨！然后当玉米完全成熟的时候，它就会落下来，嘎嘎作响，到处都是，别想它落在哪里，就像它落在海上一样！”——当我父亲对园丁的呼吁得到了回应时连续几次相同的令人鼓舞的答案，然后有人会在晚餐时说：“明天，如果天气好的话，我们可能会走盖尔芒特的路。”午餐后，我们会立即出发，穿过小花园门我们走进了佩尔尚街（Rue des Perchamps），这条街狭窄，呈锐角弯曲，点缀着草地，两三只黄蜂整天在上面采摘植物，这条街就像它的名字一样古雅，它奇特的特征和个性也由此而来我觉得，它们是衍生出来的；人们可能会在今天的贡布雷中徒劳地寻找一条街道，因为公立学校现在矗立在它的所在地。 但在我对贡布雷的梦想中（就像那些建筑师，维奥莱特·勒·杜克的学生一样，他们幻想自己能够在文艺复兴时期的屋顶阁楼和十八世纪的祭坛下发现诺曼唱诗班的痕迹，并修复了整个教堂）到了可能是十二世纪的状态）我没有留下现代大厦的一块石头矗立着，我刺穿它并“恢复”佩尔尚街。对于这种重建，记忆为我提供了比修复者通常可以使用的更详细的指导。它所保存的照片——也许是当今世界上仅存的一幅照片，很快就会随着其他照片被遗忘——展示了我童年时期贡布雷的样子；这些图画，仅仅因为是古老的贡布雷在消失之前在我的脑海中描绘了它们的轮廓，就同样令人感动——如果我可以将一幅不起眼的风景与那些辉煌的作品进行比较，这些作品是我祖母非常喜欢送给我的复制品——就像《Cenacolo》的那些古老版画，或者真蒂莱·贝利尼的那幅画，人们在其中看到了达芬奇的杰作和圣马可的门廊，但它们已不复存在。

We would pass, in the Rue de l’Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesché, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would rumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes, and de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some litigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would come at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the steeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for it was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that it relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the indolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do, had simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed, at a given moment, the distended surface of the silence.
我们会经过奥伊索街 (Rue de l'Oiseau)，在奥伊索弗莱谢 (Oiseau Flesché) 的老旅馆前，从前，蒙庞西埃公爵夫人、盖尔芒特夫人和蒙莫朗西公爵夫人的马车会隆隆驶入其大庭院，当他们不得不来到贡布雷与他们的农民进行一些诉讼，或者接受他们的致敬。我们最终会到达广场，在广场的树顶上我可以辨认出圣伊莱尔的尖塔。我本来希望能够坐下来，在那里度过一整天，读书，听钟声，因为那里是如此迷人，如此安静，当一个小时到来时，你不会说它闯进来了。那天的平静，但它减轻了这一天的多余，而尖塔，以一个无事可做的人的懒惰、艰苦的精确性，只是为了挤出并让其落下。几滴金色的水滴在炎热的阳光下缓慢而自然地积聚起来，在某一时刻压在了寂静的膨胀表面上。

The great charm of the ‘Guermantes’ way was that we had beside us, almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux. And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer’s boy through his disguise of a beadle’s uniform or chorister’s surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l’Exempt, fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers’ school, who came there in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water’s edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name—a name fit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine and the water’s edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the golden East.
“盖尔芒特”方式的巨大魅力在于，维冯纳河的路线几乎一直在我们身边。离开家十分钟后，我们首先通过一座名为旧桥的人行桥穿过它。每年，当我们在复活节早上到达贡布雷时，布道结束后，如果天气晴朗，我就会跑到那里去看看（在一个盛大节日的早晨普遍存在的混乱中），为庆祝活动所做的华丽准备工作。让那些他们没有想办法消灭的日常家用器皿显得比以前更加肮脏）河水流过，天蓝色的河岸之间仍然是黑色和光秃秃的，它唯一的同伴是一丛水仙花，在它们的时间之前出现了，一些报春花，第一朵花，到处都燃烧着紫罗兰的蓝色火焰，它的茎在储存在它小角里的香水滴的重量下弯曲了。老桥通向一条拖道，在夏天，这条拖道上会挂满蓝色的榛树叶子，戴着草帽的渔夫似乎已经在树下扎根了。在贡布雷，我认识每个人，并且总能通过他伪装的执事制服或唱诗班法衣发现铁匠或杂货商的男孩，这个渔夫是我唯一无法认出的人。他一定认识我的家人，因为当我们经过时他常常举起帽子。然后我总是正要问他的名字，这时有人会对我做出安静的手势，否则我会吓到鱼。我们会沿着一条沿着陡峭河岸顶部延伸的拖道行驶，比溪流高出几英尺。另一边的地势较低，有一系列宽阔的草地，一直延伸到村庄，甚至延伸到远处的火车站。 上面散落着古贡布雷伯爵城堡的残骸，半埋在长长的草丛中，在中世纪，康布雷伯爵的这一侧曾以维冯纳河为屏障，抵御来自其他国家的进攻。盖尔芒特勋爵和马丁维尔修道院院长。现在什么都没有留下了，除了一些塔楼的树桩，广阔的田野上的小丘，几乎看不见的破碎的城垛，在他们的时代，弓箭手在上面投掷石头，守望者凝视着诺夫蓬特，克莱枫丹，马丁维尔-le-Sec，Bailleau-l'Exempt，盖尔芒特的所有封地，贡布雷被锁在这个环中；但现在倒在草地上，与地面齐平，由基督教兄弟学校的男孩们攀爬和指挥，他们在玩耍时来到那里，或者带着要学习的教科书；过去的象征已经沉入地下，几乎消失在地底下，现在躺在水边，像一个闲人在呼吸空气，却给了我强烈的思考素材，使贡布雷这个名字对我来说并不意味着今天的小镇，却是一座截然不同的历史名城，它半隐藏在闪闪发光的毛茛花的面纱下，那些遥远的、难以理解的特征抓住并占据了我的想象力。 因为毛茛在它们选择在草地上玩耍的这个地方长大，它们单独地、成对地、成群地站着，黄得像蛋黄，闪烁着额外的光泽，我觉得，因为，我无法用我的味觉来完善看到它们时给我带来的愉悦，当我的眼睛扫过它们镀金的广阔空间时，我会让它积累起来，直到它获得力量在我的脑海中创造一个绝对的新鲜例子，非生产性的美丽；从我很小的时候起，我就从纤道上向他们伸出双臂，甚至在我能说出他们迷人的名字之前——这个名字适合法国童话故事中的王子；也许是在距亚洲遥远的某个世纪里的殖民者，但现在已经永远归化在这个村庄里了，他们对自己平淡的地平线感到非常满意，在阳光和水边欢欣鼓舞，忠实于他们对火车站的那一瞥；尽管如此，正如我们的一些旧画一样，其平民朴素的风格仍然保留着来自金色东方的诗意光芒。

I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once ‘containers’ whose transparent sides were like solidified water and ‘contents’ plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation.
我会通过观察玻璃罐来取乐，男孩们常常将玻璃罐放入维冯讷河中捕捉小鱼，这些玻璃罐被溪流充满，它们自己也被封闭在其中，立刻成为“容器”，其透明的侧面就像凝固的水和“内容物”投入到一个更大的液体容器中，流动的水晶，暗示着一种凉爽的形象，比同一个罐子里的同样的水站在餐桌上更美味、更刺激，表现出它永远在难以触及的水和不溶的玻璃之间飞行，在水里我的手无法抓住它，在不溶的玻璃里我的味觉无法享受它。我决定再次带着鱼线去那里钓鱼；我向午餐篮乞讨并得到了一点面包。然后将其扔进维冯纳颗粒中，这些颗粒似乎具有产生化学沉淀的能力，因为水立即在颗粒周围形成固体，形成瘦弱的蝌蚪椭圆形簇，毫无疑问，在那之前，它们一直被困在水中。溶液，看不见，但准备好并警觉地进入结晶阶段。

Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants. At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current, across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt Léonie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange, ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.
不久，维冯河的河道被水生植物堵塞了。起初，它们是单独出现的，例如一朵百合花，不幸的是，水流横穿了它的路径，它永远不会静止片刻，因此，就像一艘机械推进的渡船一样，它会漂向一个人。银行只是为了返回到另一个，永远重复它的双重旅程。当它冲向岸边时，它的茎会被拉直、拉长，几乎绷紧到断裂点，直到水流再次抓住它，它的绿色系泊装置又回到锚地上方，把这棵不幸的植物带到了所谓的起点。 ，因为它注定不会在那里停留片刻，然后再次出发。我仍然会在那里发现它，在一次又一次的散步中，总是处于同样的无助状态，暗示着某些神经衰弱的受害者，其中我的祖父可能包括我的莱奥妮姨妈，她年复一年地毫无修饰地呈现出他们的奇观。他们总是想象自己即将摆脱这些奇怪而难以解释的习惯，但他们总是保留到最后；他们陷入了自己的疾病和怪癖的困境中，他们徒劳地试图逃脱，只是启动了它的机制，让他们奇怪的、不可避免的、致命的日常循环继续运转。这些就是睡莲，也像那些不幸的人一样，他们所遭受的特殊折磨，在永恒中无限期地重复，引起了但丁的好奇心，他本来会从受害者本人那里更详细、更详细地询问他们，不是维吉尔大步走在前面，迫使他全速追赶他，就像我必须追赶我的父母一样。

But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonné. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals.
但更远的地方，水流减弱了，小溪流过一处由业主向公众开放的土地，业主有水生园艺的爱好，因此维冯纳河在这里改道进入的小池塘里开满了睡莲。 。由于此时的河岸树木茂密，浓浓的树荫给水面带来了通常是深绿色的背景，尽管有时，当我们在暴风雨的下午后平静的晚上回家时，我看到了它的深处一种清澈、原始的蓝色，几乎是紫罗兰色，让人联想到日本景泰蓝地板。水面上到处漂浮着像草莓一样红润的花朵，一圈白色花瓣中镶嵌着一朵百合花的猩红色花心。

Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery—with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky.
除此之外，花朵更加频繁，但颜色更浅，光泽度更低，种子更厚，折叠更紧密，并且偶然地以花彩布置得如此优雅，以至于我想象自己看到漂浮在溪流上，仿佛在沉闷地剥离了一些华托节日中使用的装饰，松散的花环中的苔藓玫瑰。在其他地方，似乎有一个角落是为普通种类的百合预留的。像火箭花一样纯粉色或白色，像瓷器一样清洗干净，并经过家庭主妇的护理；稍远一点的地方，还有其他的植物，紧紧地挤在浮动的花园花坛里，仿佛三色堇像蝴蝶一样从花园里飞了出来，在这片水边透明的阴影上盘旋着蓝色、闪亮的翅膀。天空的边界也是如此，因为它在花朵下面设置了比花朵本身颜色更珍贵、更动人的土壤。下午，当它在万花筒般的幸福的万花筒下闪闪发光时，沉默，焦躁，警觉，而到了傍晚，当它像遥远的天堂一样充满了落日的玫瑰色梦想，不断变化和永恒保持和谐，关于花朵本身更持久的颜色，具有最大的深度、转瞬即逝和神秘性——带有无限的安静暗示；午后或傍晚，它们似乎在天空的中心绽放。

After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly. How often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free to live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it drift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace.
离开这个公园后，维冯河又开始流速更快。有多少次，当我应该可以自由地按照自己选择的方式生活时，我看到并渴望模仿一个划船者，他已经把桨运走了，仰面躺着，低着头，躺在船底，让船桨在船底转动。随波逐流，什么也看不见，只有天空在他头顶上静静地滑过，在他的脸上显露出幸福与平静的预兆。

We would sit down among the irises at the water’s edge. In the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed by the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with an anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.
我们会坐在水边的鸢尾花丛中。节日的天空中，一朵懒洋洋的云舒展开来。时不时地，一条鲤鱼被闲散的重担压垮了，焦急地喘着气，从水中浮上来。到了我们吃饭的时间了。在启程回家之前，我们会在那儿坐很长一段时间，在草地上吃水果、面包和巧克力，耳边传来圣伊莱尔的钟声，水平的、微弱的、但坚固的、金属般的声音，它在它习惯于穿越的大气中根本没有融化，但是，由于它们所有响亮的笔触的连续颤动而破碎，当它掠过我们脚下的花朵时，它在颤动。

Sometimes, at the water’s edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon a house of the kind called ‘pleasure houses,’ isolated and lost, seeing nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, ‘to bury herself,’ to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had been unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard, through the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom, before they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they known, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And I watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious, useless charm.
有时，在水边，嵌在树林里，我们会遇到一栋被称为“游乐屋”的房子，它与世隔绝，迷失了方向，除了沐浴在脚下的河流外，看不到任何其他的东西。一位年轻女子，她沉思的脸庞和时髦的面纱并不表明她是当地出身，她无疑是来这里的，用流行的说法来说，“埋葬自己”，品尝她的名字的苦涩甜味，更重要的是，那个她曾经心心念念却无法留住的人，在窗外无人知晓，他的名字就站在窗外，从窗外她看不到停泊在门边的小船。当她透过岸边的树林听到路人的声音时，她心烦意乱地抬起了眼睛，在他们出现之前，她可以肯定他们从来不知道，也不会知道。不忠的情人，他们过去的生活中没有任何东西带有他的印记，他们的未来也没有机会接受他的印记。人们觉得，在她放弃生命的过程中，她心甘情愿地放弃了那些她至少能够见到她所爱的他的地方，而去寻找他从未踏足过的地方。我看着她，当她沿着一条她知道他不会出现的路散步回来时，她从她顺从的手指上抽出长手套，手套上戴着珍贵的、无用的魅力。

Never, in the course of our walks along the ‘Guermantes way,’ might we penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often thought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from Combray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earth’s surface, where, according to the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that other goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I knew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually exist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself either in tapestry, as was the ‘Coronation of Esther’ which hung in our church, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in his window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row of chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Geneviève de Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling—in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age, and bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable ‘antes.’ And if, in spite of that, they were for me, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes of which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit ‘Guermantes way’ of our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it—Comtes de Combray, possessing Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors of the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling, presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the ‘other side’ in dull black lacquer, if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus’s for a packet of salt.
在我们沿着“盖尔芒特之路”行走的过程中，我们永远不可能深入到维冯纳的源头，我经常想到它，它在我的脑海中有着如此抽象、如此理想的存在，以至于我当有人告诉我，它实际上是在同一个部门，距离贡布雷一定英里的地方被发现时，我感到非常惊讶，就像我那天得知在某个地方还有另一个固定点时一样感到惊讶。根据古人的说法，地球表面是地狱之门打开的地方。我们也永远无法实现我如此渴望实现的另一个目标，即盖尔芒特本身。我知道这是它的主人盖尔芒特公爵和公爵夫人的住所，我知道他们是确实存在的真实人物，但每当我想到他们时，我都会在挂毯上想象他们，就像“加冕典礼”一样挂在我们教堂里的《以斯帖记》，或者是变化着的彩虹色，就像坏人吉尔伯特在他的窗户上一样，当我将手指浸入圣水汤中时，他从卷心菜绿色变成了梅子蓝色。已经到达了我们那排椅子上，或者又是完全难以捉摸的，就像盖尔芒特家族的祖先吉纳维芙·德·布拉班特的形象一样，神灯让它在我房间的窗帘上徘徊，或者高高地抛在天花板上——总之，总是包裹着沉浸在墨洛温王朝时代的神秘之中，沐浴在从响亮的音节“antes”发出的橙色光芒中，就像在日落中一样。”尽管如此，如果他们对我来说，以公爵和公爵夫人的身份，是真正的人，尽管是一种陌生的人，那么这位公爵的人格反过来又被极大地膨胀，无形化，从而包围和包围了他们。包括他们作为公爵和公爵夫人的盖尔芒特，我们散步的所有阳光明媚的“盖尔芒特之路”，维冯纳河的路线，它的睡莲和遮荫的树木，以及无尽的炎热夏日午后。我知道他们不仅拥有盖尔芒特公爵和公爵夫人的头衔，而且自十四世纪以来，在试图在战斗中征服其早期领主徒劳之后，他们通过婚姻结盟，因此成为贡布雷伯爵，因此，是这个地方的第一批公民，但也是其公民中唯一没有居住在这个地方的人——孔布雷伯爵，拥有贡布雷，将其串在他们的名字和头衔上，将其吸收到他们的个性中，并且毫无疑问，这一切本身就说明了贡布雷特有的那种奇怪而虔诚的忧郁情绪。该镇的业主，尽管不是该镇任何特定房屋的业主；想必他住在户外、街道上、天地之间，就像吉尔伯特·德·盖尔芒特一样，我在圣伊莱尔后殿的彩色玻璃中看到他，只有“另一面”是暗黑色的漆器，如果我去加缪家拿一包盐时抬起眼睛寻找他。

And then it happened that, going the ‘Guermantes way,’ I passed occasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I heard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father’s arranging everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who ‘really counted,’ that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which Françoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat’s son, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began with ‘A,’ instead of having to wait his turn as an ‘S.’ If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my father’s understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience.
然后碰巧，在走“盖尔芒特之路”时，我偶尔会经过一排浇水充足的小花园，花园的树篱上长满了一簇簇深色的花朵。我会在他们面前停下来，希望能够为我的经历增添一些宝贵的东西，因为我的眼前似乎有那个河边乡村的一个片段，自从看到一个人对它的描述以来，我就一直渴望看到和了解它。我最喜欢的作家。正是在这片故事书般的土地上，想象中的土壤被一百条冒泡的水道相交，盖尔芒特在我的脑海中改变了它的形式，在我听到珀塞皮德博士谈论鲜花、迷人的小溪和喷泉之后，我就认同了盖尔芒特。那是在公爵公园里可以看到的。我曾经梦见过那位女士。德·盖尔芒特突然对自己产生了任性的幻想，邀请我去那里，她整天站在我身边钓鳟鱼。当夜幕降临时，她握着我的手，经过她封臣的小花园，她会向我指出那些红色和紫色的穗状花序沿着低墙顶部倾斜的花朵，并会教我他们所有的名字。她也会让我告诉她所有关于我打算写的诗。这些梦想提醒我，既然我希望有一天成为一名作家，那么现在就是决定我要写什么类型的书的时候了。但是，一旦我问自己这个问题，并试图发现一些我可以赋予其无限价值的哲学意义的主题，我的思想就会像时钟一样停止，我会看到我面前的空虚，什么也没有，会觉得我要么完全没有天赋，或者说，也许是大脑的疾病阻碍了它的发展。 有时我会依赖父亲为我安排一切。他是如此强大，深受那些“真正重要”的人的青睐，以至于他让我们有可能违反弗朗索瓦丝教我的法律，这些法律比生与死的法律更不可避免，就像我们被允许那样推迟一年强制重新粉刷我们房子的墙壁，在巴黎那个地区的所有房子中，这是独一无二的，或者当他获得部长夫人的许可时。萨泽拉特的儿子被命令去某个水源地，提前两个月在姓氏以“A”开头的候选人中获得学位，而不是必须以“S”的身份等待轮到他。如果我被强盗俘虏了，我就已经病得很重了，我相信我父亲对最高权力的理解太全面了，他写给全能者的介绍信对我的疾病或囚禁来说太不可抗拒，除了虚幻的幻想之外，我什么也做不了，在没有任何危险真正威胁到我的情况下，我应该完全镇静地等待我回到舒适的现实、从束缚中解脱出来或恢复健康的不可避免的时刻。也许这种人才的匮乏，当我为未来写作的主题而搜寻时，在我的脑海中张开的黑色空洞，本身也只不过是一种不真实的幻觉，并且会通过我的干预而结束。父亲，他会与政府和上帝安排，让我成为当今第一位作家。 但有时，当我的父母看到我在后面闲逛而不是跟随他们而变得不耐烦时，我的真实生活并不像是父亲人为创造的，而且是他可以根据自己的选择进行修改的生活，相反， ，被包含在一个更大的现实中，这个现实不是为了我的利益而创造的，它的判断没有吸引力，在它的心中，我被束缚，无助，没有朋友或盟友，除此之外，没有隐藏任何进一步的可能性。那时我就​​清楚地意识到，我和其他人一样以同样的方式存在，我必须变老，我必须像他们一样死去，而在他们之中，我仅仅被视为那些没有能力的人之一。写作。于是，尽管布洛赫给了我鼓励，我还是彻底沮丧地永远放弃了文学。这种亲密的、自发的感觉，这种我的智力毫无意义的感觉，战胜了所有可能对我大肆奉承的言辞，就像一个恶人，当每个人都大声赞扬他的善行时，却被秘密所折磨。良心的悔恨。

One day my mother said: ‘You are always talking about Mme. de Guermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter’s wedding. You will be able to see her in church.’ It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de Léon.
有一天，我母亲说：‘你总是在谈论我夫人。德盖尔芒特。嗯，四年前，当她生病时，珀塞皮德医生为她做了很多事情，所以她要来贡布雷参加他女儿的婚礼。你可以在教堂里见到她。” 碰巧，我从佩尔塞皮德博士那里听到最多关于夫人的事。德·盖尔芒特，他甚至给我们看了一份插图纸的编号，其中描绘了她穿着她在莱昂公主举行的化装舞会上穿着的服装。

Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side, enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:—a large nose, blue eyes, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: ‘This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes.’ Now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and tradesmen. ‘It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!’ were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of ‘Mme. de Guermantes,’ appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern.
突然，在婚礼弥撒中，执事向一侧移动，让我看到坐在教堂里的一位女士，金发碧眼，大鼻子，一双锐利的蓝眼睛，一条飘逸的紫红色丝质围巾，光滑而崭新。很漂亮，鼻角有一个小斑点。因为在她红红的脸庞上，仿佛非常温暖，我可以辨认出一些淡化的、几乎难以察觉的细节，这些细节与向我展示的肖像相似。因为，更特别的是，如果我试图对这位女士的特征进行分类的话，我会用完全相同的术语来表达自己：大鼻子，蓝眼睛，正如珀塞皮德博士在我在场时描述的那样盖尔芒特公爵夫人，我对自己说：“这位女士就像盖尔芒特公爵夫人。”现在，她参加葬礼的教堂是坏人吉尔伯特的教堂。在其平坦的墓碑下面，安放着老布拉班特伯爵的骨头，这些墓碑泛黄，像蜂巢里的蜂蜜一样鼓起。我记得曾听人说过，每当盖尔芒特家族的任何成员来贡布雷参加仪式时，这座教堂都是为盖尔芒特家族保留的。确实，只有一个女人与夫人的肖像相似。德·盖尔芒特那天，也就是她预计要来的那一天，竟然坐在那个小教堂里：就是她！我非常失望。这是因为当我想到夫人时，我没有想到。德·盖尔芒特，我用挂毯或彩绘窗户的颜色为自己描绘她，她生活在另一个世纪，与其他人类有着不同的本质。我从来没有考虑到她可能有一张红色的脸，一条淡紫色的围巾，就像夫人一样。 萨泽拉特；她脸颊的椭圆形曲线让我强烈地想起了我在家里见过的人，以至于我产生了这样的怀疑（尽管它立即被消除了）：这位女士的创作原则，她的身体构成的分子，是也许本质上不是盖尔芒特公爵夫人，但她的身体，不知道人们给它起的名字，属于某种类型的女性气质，其中也包括医生和商人的妻子。 “是的，一定是夫人。”德·盖尔芒特夫人，没有其他人！”这是我注视着这幅画时的专注和惊讶的表情，这自然与那些经常出现在同一标题下的“德·盖尔芒特夫人”毫无相似之处。 “德·盖尔芒特先生”出现在我的梦中，因为这个人不像其他人那样是我自己随意塑造的，而是刚刚在教堂里第一次出现在我的视野里。一个不具有相同性质的图像，不能随意着色，就像其他那些让自己吸收响亮音节的橙色色调的图像一样，但它是如此真实，以至于一切，甚至是角落里火热的小点。她的鼻子，保证了她服从生命的法则，就像在舞台上的变形场景中，仙女裙子上的折痕，她小手指的颤抖，表明一个活生生的女演员在我们眼前的物质存在，而直到那时我们还不确定我们是否看到的不仅仅是灯笼的聚光灯投射。

Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent nose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision (perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the first impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de Guermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: ‘It is Mme. de Guermantes”; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me: ‘Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Geneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.’
与此同时，我正努力将其应用到这个形象上，突出的鼻子，锐利的眼睛固定并固定在我的视野中（也许是因为他们首先击中了它，在它的表面上留下了第一印象，然后我曾一度怀疑出现在我面前的这位女士是否可能是德·盖尔芒特夫人），对于这个新鲜而不变的形象，我的想法是：“这是德·盖尔芒特夫人”。德盖尔芒特”；但我只成功地让想法在我和图像之间传递，就好像它们是两个在不同平面上移动的圆盘，中间有空间。但这位女士。我经常梦到的德·盖尔芒特，现在我可以看到她有一个独立于我自己的真实存在，我的想象力获得了新的增强的力量，而我的想象力因与与任何事物如此不同的现实接触而暂时瘫痪了正如它所预料的那样，开始做出反应，并在我心里说：“在查理曼时代之前，盖尔芒特家族伟大而光荣，对他们的封臣拥有生杀予夺的权利；”盖尔芒特公爵夫人是吉纳维芙·德·布拉班特的后裔。她不认识，也不会同意认识今天在场的任何人。

And then—oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as far as it may choose—while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart.
然后——哦，人类凝视的奇妙的独立性，被一根如此松散、如此长、如此有弹性的绳子绑在人的脸上，以至于它可以独自流浪，无论它可以选择多远——而夫人。德·盖尔芒特坐在她已故祖先坟墓上方的小教堂里，她的目光在这里徘徊，在那里徘徊，上升到柱子的顶端，甚至停留在我自己身上，就像一缕阳光从中殿洒下来，但一缕阳光，在我接受它的爱抚的那一刻，它似乎意识到它落到了哪里。至于女士。德·盖尔芒特本人，因为她一动不动地坐在那里，像一位母亲假装没有注意到孩子们在玩耍时与她不认识的人说话的粗鲁或尴尬行为，所以不可能我要确定她是赞同还是谴责她的眼神在她的心的粗心疏离中的流浪。

I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before I had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for years past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later reference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious, authentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now that, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face—and especially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived—I found only beauty there; setting her once again (since they were one and the same person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape) apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation round me: ‘She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat’ or ‘than Mlle. Vinteuil,’ as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: ‘How lovely she is! What true nobility! it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, that I have before me!’ And the care which I took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her, and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all those Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in return, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs, in a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in any way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see again to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle astonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to address it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves. This smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, ‘Of course, she is thinking about me.’ I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would, perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account. And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours, it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet dedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the Square and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly advanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a bloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages of Lohengrin, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand how Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet ‘delicious.’
我觉得重要的是，在我能够长时间地看着她之前，她不应该离开教堂，提醒自己，在过去的几年里，我一直认为见到她是一件非常令人渴望的事情，并且我一直保持着我的热情。眼睛盯着她，仿佛通过凝视她，我就能忘记那突出的鼻子、那红红的脸颊，以及所有那些让我印象深刻的细节，并把这些细节储存起来，以供日后参考。关于她的脸，有这么多珍贵、真实、无与伦比的信息。现在，每当我把心思放在那张脸上时——尤其是，也许，在我的决心中，那种自我保护的本能，我们用它来保护自己最好的一切，不承认我有无论如何，我都被欺骗了——我在那里只发现了美丽；再次让她（因为他们是同一个人，坐在我面前的这位女士和盖尔芒特公爵夫人，直到那时，我一直习惯于将她变成想象中的形状）远离并超越人类的共同运行当我听到周围的人群中有人说：“她比我夫人好看时，我感到很愤怒。” Sazerat”或“比Mlle。 Vinteuil，”好像她在任何方面都可以与他们相提并论。我的目光停留在她的金发、蓝眼睛、脖子的线条上，俯瞰着那些可能让我想起其他女人的面孔的特征，当我欣赏这幅故意未完成的素描时，我在心里大声喊道：“她多么可爱啊！多么真正的贵族啊！摆在我面前的确实是一位骄傲的盖尔芒特，他是吉纳维芙·德·布拉班特的后裔！’而我小心翼翼地将所有注意力集中在她的脸上，成功地把它完全隔离开来，以至于今天，当我想起那场婚礼时，我发现除了她之外，我无法想象在场的任何一个人，当我询问那位女士是否确实是夫人时，教区牧师给了我肯定的答复。德盖尔芒特。但她，我还是看得很清楚，尤其是当游行队伍鱼贯进入圣器收藏室的那一刻，在风雨交加的间歇性炎热阳光的照耀下，夫人。德·盖尔芒特发现自己置身于贡布雷人之中，她甚至不知道他们的名字，但他们的自卑却如此大声地宣示着她的至高无上，以至于她必须反过来对他们产生一种真诚的、怜悯的同情，她对他们怀有一种真诚的同情。凭借她的朴素和自然魅力，她可能会更令人印象深刻。而且，由于她无法发挥在人群中向认识的人投来的带有明确含义的深思熟虑的目光，所以她必须让模糊的思绪不断地从她的眼睛中消失。她无力控制那股蓝光的洪流，她急于不以任何方式感到痛苦，不想显得蔑视那些电流流过的卑微凡人，到处都被他们逮捕。今天，我再次看到，在她丝滑而活泼的紫红色围巾上方，她眼中流露出温柔的惊讶，她不敢特意向任何人表达这种惊讶，而是为了让每个人都能享受到他的那一份。一位君主女士近乎胆怯的微笑，似乎在为自己出现在她所爱的封臣之中而道歉。我的脸上也挂着这个微笑，我的眼睛一直在追随她。 而我，想起她在仪式上向我投来的目光，蓝色的目光就像透过坏人吉尔伯特的窗户的一缕阳光，我对自己说：“当然，她在想我。”我想象着我在她眼前很受欢迎，离开教堂后她会继续想起我，也许那天晚上在盖尔芒特，她会因为我而再次陷入沉思。我立刻就爱上了她，因为如果有时足以让我们爱一个女人，她就会用轻蔑的眼神看着我们，就像我猜想的那样。斯万已经做到了，虽然我们想象她永远不会属于我们，但有时她像斯万夫人一样善意地看着我们就足够了。德盖尔芒特当时就这样做了，而我们已经认为她几乎已经是我们的了。她的眼睛像长春花一样呈蓝色，完全超出了我的能力范围，但却是她献给我的。太阳再次从威胁性的云层后面射出，将全部光线投射到广场和圣器收藏室上，在为婚礼铺就的红地毯上洒下天竺葵的光芒。德·盖尔芒特微笑着走上前来，用玫瑰色的天鹅绒绒毛覆盖羊毛质地，绽放出光芒，在欢乐庆典的盛况中赋予它一种温柔、庄严的甜蜜，这是《罗恩格林》的某些页面、某些画作的特征。 Carpaccio，让我们了解波德莱尔如何能够将“美味”这个绰号应用到小号的声音上。’

How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the ‘Guermantes way,’ and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour—to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side.
那天之后，在我沿着“盖尔芒特之路”散步的过程中，我有多少次以一种强烈的忧郁心情反思自己缺乏从事文学事业的资格，并且我必须放弃成为一名文学家的所有希望。著名作家。当我独自徘徊，独自做一点小梦时，我为此感到遗憾，这让我感到非常痛苦，为了不去感受它，我的心在做梦的那一瞬间就通过一种抑制来不去感受它。痛苦，完全不再思考诗歌创作、小说、诗歌的未来，而我缺乏天赋，无法指望这些未来。然后，远离所有那些文学的关注，也没有对任何事物有明确的依恋，突然出现一个屋顶，从石头上反射出的一道阳光，道路的气味会让我停下来，享受他们每个人所带来的特殊乐趣。也因为他们似乎在我的眼睛所见之下隐藏着一些东西，他们邀请我接近并从他们那里夺取，但尽管我付出了一切努力，我却从未发现过。当我感觉到在他们身上发现了神秘的物体时，我会站在他们面前，一动不动，凝视着，呼吸着，努力用我的思想穿透所看到或闻到的东西。如果我必须赶紧追赶祖父，继续赶路，我仍然会闭上眼睛，试图恢复对他们的感觉；我会集中精力准确地回忆屋顶的线条，石头的颜色，在我无法理解为什么的情况下，它在我看来似乎充满了，准备打开，向我展示秘密宝藏它们本身只不过是外壳。 当然，这种印象不能或不会恢复我曾经失去的希望，有一天成功成为一名作家和诗人，因为他们每个人都与一些缺乏任何智力价值的物质对象联系在一起，并且暗示没有抽象的东西。真相。但至少它们给了我一种不合理的快乐，一种心灵丰富的幻觉；这样一来，我就可以摆脱单调乏味的感觉，摆脱每当我为一些伟大的文学作品寻找哲学主题时所感受到的自己的无能感。这些形状、香味或颜色的印象给我的良心带来了如此紧迫的任务——努力去感知隐藏在它们之下的东西，我从来没有花很长时间寻找借口，让我放松如此艰苦的努力。并让自己免受由此带来的疲劳。幸运的是，我的父母打电话给我；我觉得我暂时还没有成功地进行研究所必需的平静环境，最好在回到家之前不要再想这件事，同时也不要让自己筋疲力尽。没有目的。因此，我不再关心隐藏在某种形式或香水中的神秘，心里很轻松，因为我把它带回家，受到它可见和有形的覆盖物的保护，在它下面我应该找到它还活着，就像鱼一样，在我被允许出去钓鱼的日子里，我常常把它们装进篮子里带回来，埋在草丛里，这样可以保持它们凉爽和新鲜。 一旦回到家里，我就会开始想别的事情，所以我的脑子里就会乱七八糟（因为我的房间里摆满了我散步时收集的鲜花，或者人们给我的零碎东西）反射阳光的石头，屋顶，钟声，落叶的气味，一堆不同图像的混乱，在它们之下，我曾经有过某种不祥预感的现实一定早已消失了。 ，但我从来没有精力去发现和揭露它。然而，有一次，当我们的步行时间远远超出了平常的限制时，很高兴在回家的半路上，当下午逐渐变黑时，遇到了佩尔塞皮德博士，他开着马车从我们身边全速驶过，看到并认出了我们，停下来，让我们跳到他身边，我收到了这样的印象，在没有先对其进行更彻底的检查之前，我不会放弃它。我被安排在车夫旁边的包厢上，我们走得像风一样，因为医生在返回贡布雷之前仍然拜访了马丁维尔勒塞克，在一个病人的家里，他在病人的门口问我们等他。在路的一个拐弯处，当我看到马丁维尔的双尖塔，夕阳照在上面，马车和汽车在移动时，我突然体验到了一种与其他任何事物都不同的特殊乐趣。蜿蜒的道路似乎让他们不断改变位置。然后是第三座尖塔，即维厄克斯维克尖塔，虽然它与他们隔着一座小山和一个山谷，而且从远处较高的地面上拔地而起，但看起来仍然站在他们旁边。

In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once to contain and to conceal.
在确定和注意到它们尖顶的形状、外观的变化、表面阳光般的温暖时，我觉得我并没有完全理解我的印象，在那种流动性、那种亮度的背后隐藏着更多的东西，某种东西它们似乎既包含又隐藏。

The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.
尖塔显得那么遥远，而我们自己似乎离它们又那么近，以至于几分钟后，当我们停在马丁维尔教堂外时，我感到很惊讶。我不知道看到它们出现在地平线上时我感到如此高兴的原因是什么，而试图找出这个原因的工作对我来说似乎很令人厌烦。我只想将那些在阳光下移动的交汇线保留在我的大脑中，暂时不再去想它们。如果我这样做的话，那两座尖塔很可能会永远消失在树木、屋顶、气味和声音的大杂烩中，我注意到这些尖塔，并由于它们给人带来的模糊的快乐感而将它们分开。我，但从未更充分地探索过它们。当我们等待医生再次出现时，我从包厢下来与父母交谈。然后是时候开始了；我再次爬上自己的住处，再次回头看向我的尖塔，过了一会儿，我在道路的一个转弯处瞥见了尖塔。车夫似乎不太愿意交谈，几乎没有承认我的言论，由于缺乏其他社会，我不得不依靠自己，并试图重新捕捉我的尖塔的视野。不久，它们的轮廓和阳光照射下的表面，就好像它们是一种外皮一样，被剥离了。他们向我隐瞒的一些事情变得显而易见了。一个想法出现在我的脑海中，这个想法在我之前并不存在，它在我的脑海中以文字的形式呈现出来。刚才第一眼看到它们时，我的喜悦之情更加强烈，以至于我被一种陶醉所压倒，除了它们，我什么也想不到。 此时，虽然我们已经离开马丁维尔很远了，但我转过头，再次看到了他们，这次很黑，因为太阳已经落山了。每隔几分钟，道路就会出现一个转弯，他们就会从视线中消失。然后他们最后一次现身，所以我再也见不到他们了。

Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there.
我不承认埋藏在马丁维尔尖塔里的东西一定是类似迷人短语的东西，因为它以文字的形式出现，让我很高兴它出现在我面前，我从那里借了一支铅笔和一些纸。尽管马车颠簸，为了安抚我的良心并满足我的热情，他写下了下面这个小片段，我后来发现了它，现在将其复制出来，只做了一些轻微的修改。

Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church.
独自一人，从平原上升起，似乎迷失在那片开阔的乡村中，爬上马丁维尔的双尖塔的天空。不久，我们看到了三个：以勇敢的伏特的姿态跳到与他们对峙的位置，第三个，一个拖延的尖塔，维厄维克的尖塔，也来加入他们。时间一分一秒过去，我们的行进速度很快，但三座尖塔却始终遥遥领先，就像三只鸟栖息在平原上，一动不动，在阳光下格外显眼。然后，维厄维克的尖塔撤退了，保持了适当的距离，而马丁维尔的尖塔依然孤零零，被夕阳的光芒镀上金色，即使在那么远的地方，我也能看到它们在倾斜的侧面玩耍和微笑。我们花了很长时间才接近他们，以至于我在想我们还需要多少时间才能到达他们那里，突然，马车拐过一个拐角，把我们放在他们的脚边；他们突然冲到我们的路上，我们几乎没有时间停下来，就被撞到了教堂的门廊上。

We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and resigned, and so vanishing in the night.
我们继续我们的航程；我们离开马丁维尔不久，村庄陪伴我们几秒钟后就已经消失了，当独自在地平线上徘徊观看我们的飞行时，它的尖塔和维厄维克的尖塔再次挥手，以示告别。 ，他们沐浴在阳光下的尖峰。有时其中一个会退出，以便另外两个可以观察我们一会儿。然后道路改变了方向，它们像三个金色的枢轴一样在光线中转向，从我的视线中消失了。但是，过了一会儿，当我们已经接近贡布雷时，太阳已经落山了，我最后一次看到它们，在很远的地方，现在看起来只不过是在低线上方的天空上画的三朵花。字段。它们也让我想起了传说中的三个少女，她们被遗弃在一个偏僻的地方，夜幕已经降临。当我们疾驰离开他们时，我可以看到他们胆怯地寻找着自己的路，在他们高贵的轮廓做了一些笨拙的、跌跌撞撞的动作之后，彼此靠近，一个接一个地滑倒，现在什么也没有表现出来了，在依然玫瑰色的天空的映衬下，只有一个昏暗的身影，迷人而听天由命，就这样消失在夜色中。

I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor’s coachman was in the habit of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.
我再也没有想到这一页，但是当我坐在包厢的一角时，医生的马车夫习惯将他在马丁维尔市场买的家禽放在篮子里，我突然想到了这一点。写完这篇文章后，我感到一种幸福感，感觉它完全解除了我对尖塔的迷恋和它们所隐藏的神秘，就好像我自己是一只母鸡，刚刚下了一只鸡一样。鸡蛋，我开始放声歌唱。

All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de Guermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the Vivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in such moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the ‘Guermantes way’ and dinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of happiness—I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my mother’s face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it was from the ‘Guermantes way’ that I learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other.
一整天，在这些散步中，我都能沉思与盖尔芒特公爵夫人的友谊、钓鳟鱼、独自在维翁河上乘船漂流时所带来的快乐；出于对幸福的渴望，在这样的时刻，我对生活的要求就是让生活永远由一系列欢乐的下午组成。但是，在回家的路上，我看到路左边有一个农场，距离另外两个农场有一段距离，这两个农场本身很近，从那里返回贡布雷，我们只需转头就可以了。一条橡树大道，一侧是一系列果园，每一个果园都每隔一段距离就种上苹果树，当它们被夕阳照亮时，它们的影子就会投射在地面上，形成日本的影子；然后，我的心开始剧烈跳动，我知道半小时后我们就到家了，而且按照我们走“盖尔芒特方式”的日子的规定，晚餐就在家里了。 ，上菜时间比平常晚，我一喝完汤就应该被送去睡觉，这样我妈妈就不会上楼来跟我说晚​​安了，就好像有人陪着吃饭一样。在床上。我随后进入的忧郁地带与刚才我还欣喜若狂地跳跃的另一个地带完全不同，就像有时天空中一条粉红色的带子被分隔开，仿佛被一条无形的线划定，一条绿色或黑色的带子。你可能会看到一只鸟飞过粉色；它靠近边界线，接触边界线，进入黑色，然后消失在黑色中。 我刚才全神贯注地渴望去盖尔芒特、去旅行、过幸福的生活——现在我离他们是如此遥远，以至于他们的实现不会给我带来任何快乐。我多么愿意牺牲他们所有人，只是为了能够在妈妈的怀里哭一整夜！我激动得浑身发抖，痛苦的目光无法从母亲的脸上移开，那天晚上她不会出现在卧室里，我可以看到自己已经躺在想象中；只希望我已经死了。这种状态将持续到明天，那时，早晨的光线将它们的光柱倾斜，就像园丁将梯子倾斜在长满金莲花的墙上一样，金莲花一直爬到我的窗台上，我会立刻从床上跳起来，跑进花园，没有想到傍晚一定会回来，随之而来的是我必须离开母亲的时刻。因此，正是从“盖尔芒特方式”中，我学会了区分这些状态，它们在某些时期在我的脑海中交替统治，甚至每天都在它们之间划分，每个状态都有规律地返回来剥夺另一个状态发烧和疟疾：毗邻，但彼此如此陌生，如此缺乏沟通手段，以至于我无法再理解，甚至无法想象自己在一种状态下所渴望的或害怕的，甚至是所做的事情其他。

So the ‘Méséglise way’ and the ‘Guermantes way’ remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of the mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have opened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for their discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us those truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became apparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water which rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming child—as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd—that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current, and formed only to burst—my exaltation of mind has borne them with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all these successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have vanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from what place, from what time—perhaps, quite simply, from which of my dreams—it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil, as firm sites on which I still may build, that I regard the Méséglise and Guermantes ‘ways.’ It is because I used to think of certain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that the things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone, I still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers. The ‘Méséglise way’ with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple-trees, the ‘Guermantes way’ with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my only requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat, see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among the cornfields—as Saint-André-des-Champs lay hidden—an old church, monumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to encounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on the level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And yet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am seized with a desire to see again the ‘Guermantes way,’ it would not be satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of love, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me, though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest—so what I want to see again is the ‘Guermantes way’ as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.
因此，“梅塞格利兹之路”和“盖尔芒特之路”对我来说仍然与许多小事件有关，其中一个是我们沿着平行线移动的所有潜水者生活中的一个，这是命运突然逆转的最丰富的，剧集最丰富；我指的是心灵的生活。毫无疑问，它使我们取得了难以察觉的进步，真理为我们改变了它的意义和方面，在我们脚下开辟了新的道路，我们长期以来一直在为它们的发现做准备；但这种准备是无意识的；对我们来说，这些真理只能从它们变得明显的那一天、从那一刻算起。当时在草丛中嬉戏的花朵，在阳光下泛起涟漪的流水，作为它们幽灵出现的环境的整个风景，仍然以其无意识或不经意的空气徘徊在他们的记忆中；当然，当他们被这个卑微的路人、这个做梦的孩子慢慢地审视时——就像国王的脸被迷失在人群中的请愿者审视一样——那片自然，那个花园的角落永远不可能想象多亏了他，他们才得以在所有最短暂的细节中幸存下来；然而，山楂树的香味沿着树篱飘荡，过不了多久，狗玫瑰就会把它赶走，一阵脚步声，没有回声，在一条碎石路上，在树边形成了一个气泡。水流中的一株水草，只为爆裂而生——我的精神亢奋带着它们，并成功地使它们走过了这些连续的岁月，而它们周围那些曾经走过的路已经消失了，而那些拥挤的人那些道路，甚至那些拥挤在这些道路上的人的记忆，都已经死了。 有时，如此传送到当下的风景碎片会与所有的联想分离，以至于它不确定地漂浮在我的脑海中，就像提洛岛的一座鲜花盛开的岛屿，我无法说出来自什么地方、什么时间——也许，很简单，它来自我的梦想。但我认为梅塞格利兹和盖尔芒特的“道路”尤其是作为我精神土壤的最深层，作为我仍然可以在其上进行建设的坚实基础。这是因为我曾经想到某些事情，某些人当我沿着他们漫步时，他们教我认识的事物和人，只有这些，我仍然认真对待，仍然给我带来快乐。无论是创造的信念在我身上已不复存在，还是现实将仅在记忆中成形，如今人们第一次向我展示的花朵，在我看来从来都不是真正的花朵。 “梅塞格利兹之路”及其紫丁香、山楂树、矢车菊、罂粟花、苹果树，“盖尔芒特之路”及其充满蝌蚪的河流、睡莲和毛茛，对我来说一直都是如此我渴望在这片土地上度过我的一生，我唯一的要求是我可以出去钓鱼，乘船悠闲地漂流，在草地上看到哥特式堡垒的废墟，在玉米地里找到隐藏的东西——圣安德烈德尚教堂隐藏着——一座古老的教堂，雄伟、质朴，黄色像磨石；当我散步时，我可能会在田野里遇到矢车菊、山楂树、苹果树，因为它们位于同样的深度，在我前世的水平上，立刻与我的生活建立了联系。心。 然而，因为地方有个性的元素，当我渴望再次看到“盖尔芒特之路”时，即使我被带到河边，河边开满百合花，也不会满足，甚至比维冯纳的那些更公平，比我晚上回家时更公平，当我内心的痛苦苏醒时，这种痛苦在以后的生活中转移到爱情的激情上，甚至可能成为我的爱情的激情。我是形影不离的伴侣，我真希望有一个陌生的母亲能进来跟我说晚​​安，尽管她比我的母亲美丽得多、聪明得多。不：正如让我心满意足地入睡所必需的一件事（在后来的几年里，没有任何情妇能够给我的那种无忧无虑的平静，因为当人们相信它们的时候，人们就会怀疑它们，我永远无法拥有他们的心，就像我过去在她的吻中接受我母亲的心一样，完整，毫无顾忌或保留，除了我自己之外没有任何责任）是应该是我的母亲来了，她应该那张脸向我倾斜，在她眼睛下面，有一个看起来是瑕疵的东西，我和其他人一样喜欢它——所以我想再次看到的是“盖尔芒特方式”，因为我我知道这一点，这座农场距离橡树大道入口处的两个相邻农场有一点距离，距离很近。那些草地，在阳光的照射下，呈现出湖水的镜面光辉，苹果树的叶子勾勒出它们的轮廓。整个景观的个性有时在夜晚，在我的梦中，用一种近乎梦幻的力量将我束缚在一起，当我醒来时，我找不到它的踪迹。

No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time, the Méséglise and Guermantes ‘ways’ left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two ‘ways’ give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for me alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the ‘Méséglise way’ that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent lilac-trees.
毫无疑问，梅塞格利兹和盖尔芒特的“方式”在我以后的生活中，由于永久地、不可分割地在我身上组合了不同的印象，无缘无故地让我同时感受到了几种不同的东西。 ，很多的幻灭，甚至很多的错误。很多时候，我希望再见到一个人，却没有意识到，那只是因为那个人让我想起了一片盛开的山楂树篱；我被引导去相信，并让其他人相信感情的后果，仅仅是因为一种旅行的倾向。但是，由于同样的品质，并且通过它们对我的印象的坚持，今天他们可以找到依恋，这两种“方式”给这些印象提供了其他印象所缺乏的基础、深度和维度。他们也赋予它们一种魅力，一种仅对我而言的意义。夏天的傍晚，当天空像黄褐色的狮子一样咆哮，每个人都在抱怨暴风雨时，我的幻想正是沿着“梅塞格利兹之路”在狂喜中独自徘徊，在雨声中吸入，看不见的、持久的紫丁香树的气味。

And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at Combray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days besides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste—by what would have been called at Combray the ‘perfume’—-of a cup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many years after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love affair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that accuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories, following one after another, were condensed into a single substance, but had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the three strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others, inspired more recently by a taste or ‘perfume,’ and those which were actually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at second hand—no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least those veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain marbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation.
于是我常常躺到早晨，梦见在贡布雷的旧时光，梦见在那里度过的忧郁而无法入睡的夜晚；除此之外，我最近还通过品尝一杯茶——在贡布雷被称为“香水”——的味道来恢复记忆。通过回忆，我想起了一个故事，在我离开这个小地方很多年之后，有人告诉我，在我出生之前，斯万就曾参与过一段恋情。当我们研究已经去世几个世纪的人的生活时，通常比我们试图记录我们自己最亲密的朋友的生活时更容易获得细节的准确性，这种准确性似乎是不可能的在我们得知克服这种不可能的发明之前，要实现这一目标似乎是不可能的。所有这些记忆，一个接一个，都浓缩成一种物质，但到目前为止还没有融合在一起，以至于我无法区分这三个层次，区分我最古老的、我本能的记忆，以及最近受到某种味道或灵感启发的其他记忆。 “香水”，以及那些实际上是另一个人的记忆，我是从他们那里二手获得的——确实没有裂缝，没有地质断层，但至少那些纹理，那些颜色条纹，在某些岩石中，在某些地方大理石，指出了起源、年龄和形成的差异。

It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I was actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness, and—fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed the curtains and the window—would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working upon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have replaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed site. ‘But scarcely had daylight itself—and no longer the gleam from a last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for daylight—traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with its curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had erroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table, which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and sweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my dressing-room had lain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which I had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted forefinger of day.
确实，当早晨临近时，我早就解决了我醒着的梦中短暂的不确定性，我会知道我实际上躺在哪个房间里，会在黑暗中在我周围重建它，并且确定我的方向仅凭记忆，或者借助我在其脚下放置窗帘和窗户的微弱微光的帮助，就会将它及其家具完整地重建起来，就像建筑师和室内装潢师可能做的那样，在原件上工作、废弃的门窗平面图；会更换镜子并将抽屉柜放在原来的位置。 “但是几乎没有日光本身——也不再有黄铜窗帘杆上最后的、即将熄灭的余烬发出的光芒，我误以为是日光——在黑暗中划过，就像用粉笔在黑板上划过一样，它的第一个白色纠正光线，当窗户和窗帘离开门框时，我错误地把它放在门框里，同时，为了给它腾出空间，写字台，我的记忆笨拙地把它固定在窗户应该在的地方是的，会全速冲走，把壁炉架推到前面，扫开过道的墙壁。院子里的水井将坐落在刚才我的更衣室所在的地方，而我在黑暗中为自己建造的住所将与所有其他住所融为一体。我从觉醒的漩涡中瞥见了一些；白天举起的食指在我的窗帘上方划出一道苍白的标志，把它驱散了。

SWANN IN LOVE
恋爱中的天鹅

To admit you to the ‘little nucleus,’ the ‘little group,’ the ‘little clan’ at the Verdurins’, one condition sufficed, but that one was indispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose articles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under her patronage that year, and of whom she said ‘Really, it oughtn’t to be allowed, to play Wagner as well as that!’ left both Planté and Rubinstein ‘sitting’; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than Potain. Each ‘new recruit’ whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of the ‘faithful’ who were of the female sex.
要让你加入维尔迪兰的“小核心”、“小团体”、“小家族”，有一个条件就足够了，但那是必不可少的；你必须默许信条，其条款之一就是那位年轻的钢琴家，她的女士。那年维尔迪兰得到了她的赞助，她对维尔迪兰说：“真的，不应该允许扮演瓦格纳那样的角色！”让普兰特和鲁宾斯坦都“坐了下来”。而科塔德医生是一位比波坦更出色的诊断专家。维尔迪兰家族未能说服每个“新人”，让他们相信其他人在其他房子里度过的夜晚就像沟里的水一样沉闷，他们很快就发现自己被放逐了。在这方面，女性比男性更叛逆，更不愿意放弃所有世俗的好奇心和想要亲自发现其他客厅有时是否不那么有趣的愿望，而且维尔迪兰夫妇觉得，这种批判精神和这种轻浮的恶魔可能会通过传染而对小教会的正统教义造成致命的打击，他们不得不一个接一个地驱逐所有女性“信徒”。

Apart from the doctor’s young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly ‘good’ woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a ‘certain class,’ a Mme. de Crécy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a ‘love,’ and to the pianist’s aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, ‘answered the bell’: ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of ‘easy virtue’ would have contemptuously declined.
除了医生年轻的妻子之外，他们几乎都在那个季节被减少了（尽管维尔迪兰夫人本人是一个彻头彻尾的“好”女人，出身于一个受人尊敬的中产阶级家庭，非常富有，但完全不显赫，她与这个家庭结下了不解之缘。渐渐地，她自愿切断了与一位几乎属于“某个阶级”的年轻女子的所有联系，一位女士。德·克雷西女士，维尔迪兰用她的教名奥黛特称呼她，并向钢琴家的姨妈发出了“爱”的声音，她看起来好像曾一度“应门铃”：女士们对世界一无所知，她们在社交中单纯的人很容易相信，萨根公主和盖尔芒特公爵夫人不得不向其他可怜的可怜虫支付大笔金钱，以便有人参加他们的晚宴，如果有人提出为他们提供一个邀请去那些伟大的贵妇人、老门卫和“轻松美德”的女人中的任何一个家里，都会轻蔑地拒绝。

The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your ‘place laid’ there. There was never any programme for the evening’s entertainment. The young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: ‘We’re all friends here. Liberty Hall, you know!’
维尔迪兰夫妇从来没有邀请过你共进晚餐；他们从来没有邀请过你。你已经在那里找到了自己的“位置”。晚上从来没有任何娱乐节目。这位年轻的钢琴家会演奏，但前提是他愿意，因为没有人被迫做任何事情，而且，正如维尔迪兰先生常说的：“我们在这里都是朋友。”自由厅，你知道！”

If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an impression. ‘Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite well, it’s the same every time he plays that. I know what I’m in for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up—nothing doing!’ If he was not going to play they talked, and one of the friends—usually the painter who was in favour there that year—would ‘spin,’ as M. Verdurin put it, ‘a damned funny yarn that made ‘em all split with laughter,’ and especially Mme. Verdurin, for whom—so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions—Dr. Cottard, who was then just starting in general practice, would ‘really have to come one day and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.’
如果钢琴家建议演奏《女武神的骑行》或《特里斯坦的前奏曲》，夫人。维尔迪兰会抗议，不是因为音乐令她不愉快，而是相反，它给人留下了太暴力的印象。 ‘那你想让我头痛一下吗？你很清楚，他每次打球都是一样的。我知道我要做什么。明天，当我想起床的时候——什么也不做！”如果他不去玩，他们就会说话，其中一位朋友——通常是当年在那里受到青睐的画家——会“旋转”，正如维尔迪兰先生所说的那样它是“一个该死的有趣的故事，让他们都笑了起来”，尤其是夫人。维尔迪兰博士对她来说——她习惯于从字面上理解她的情感的比喻描述——她是如此强烈。科塔尔当时刚刚开始接受全科治疗，“有一天真的必须来矫正她因笑太多而脱臼的下巴。”

Evening dress was barred, because you were all ‘good pals,’ and didn’t want to look like the ‘boring people’ who were to be avoided like the plague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little ‘clan.’
晚礼服是被禁止的，因为你们都是“好朋友”，不想看起来像“无聊的人”，要像瘟疫一样避开他们，只要求参加盛大的晚会，而这样的晚会很少见。可能，而且前提是它能让画家感到高兴或让音乐家更出名。剩下的时间玩猜谜语、穿着奇装异服吃晚饭就很开心了，没必要在这个小“家族”中掺入什么奇怪的元素。

But just as the ‘good pals’ came to take a more and more prominent place in Mme. Verdurin’s life, so the ‘bores,’ the ‘nuisances’ grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made them sometimes plead ‘previous engagements,’ the mother of one, the professional duties of another, the ‘little place in the country’ of a third. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; ‘I don’t know,’ Mme. Verdurin would say, ‘I’m sure it will do him far more good if you don’t go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a good night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured.’ From the beginning of December it would make her quite ill to think that the ‘faithful’ might fail her on Christmas and New Year’s Days. The pianist’s aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on the latter, to a family dinner at her mother’s.
但正如“好朋友”在夫人身上占据越来越重要的地位一样。在维尔迪兰的生活中，“无聊”、“滋扰”逐渐包括了所有让她的朋友远离她的人和事，这使得他们有时会以“以前的约会”为借口，一个人的母亲，另一个人的职业职责，“在这个国家的三分之一的地方很小。如果科塔德医生觉得他们一起身就必须道晚安，以便回去看望某个病重的病人； “我不知道，”夫人。维尔迪兰会说：“我确信，如果你今晚不再去打扰他，这对他会更好；没有你，他也会度过一个美好的夜晚；明天早上你可以早点去，你会发现他已经痊愈了。” 从十二月初开始，一想到“忠实的信徒”可能会在圣诞节和元旦辜负她，她就会感到非常不舒服。钢琴家的姨妈坚持要求他必须陪她去她母亲家参加家庭晚宴。

‘You don’t suppose she’ll die, your mother,’ exclaimed Mme. Verdurin bitterly, ‘if you don’t have dinner with her on New Year’s Day, like people in the provinces!’
“你以为她不会死，你的母亲，”夫人大声说道。维尔迪兰苦涩地说：“如果你元旦不和她一起吃晚饭，就像外省人一样！”

Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: ‘Now you, Doctor, you’re a sensible, broad-minded man; you’ll come, of course, on Good Friday, just like any other day?’ she said to Cottard in the first year of the little ‘nucleus,’ in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone.
她的不安在圣周再次被点燃：‘现在，医生，你是一个明智、心胸宽广的人；当然，你会在耶稣受难日来，就像其他任何一天一样？”在小“核心”的第一年，她对科塔尔说道，声音响亮而自信，仿佛他的能力是毫无疑问的。回答。但她在等待时浑身颤抖，因为如果他不来，她可能会发现自己只能独自用餐。

‘I shall come on Good Friday—to say good-bye to you, for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne.’
“我会在耶稣受难日来向你道别，因为我们要去奥弗涅度假。”

‘In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot of good that will do you!’ And after a solemn pause: ‘If you had only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together, comfortably.’
“在奥弗涅？被跳蚤和各种生物吃掉！这对你有很多好处！”在庄严的停顿之后：“如果你只告诉我们，我们就会尝试举办一个聚会，然后大家一起去那里，很舒服。”

And so, too, if one of the ‘faithful’ had a friend, or one of the ladies a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman’s having a lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: ‘Very well, then, bring your friend along.’ And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the ‘little clan.’ If he failed to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the ‘faithful.’ And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the ‘faithful’ generally, which he did with boundless ingenuity.
同样，如果其中一位“忠实的”有一位朋友，或者一位女士有一位年轻人，他时不时地有责任让他们错过一个晚上，维尔迪兰一家，他们一点也不害怕如果一个女人有一个情人，只要她有他在他们的陪伴下，爱他在他们的陪伴下，并且不喜欢他胜过他们的陪伴，她会说：“很好，那么，带上你的朋友一起吧。”然后他就会被放走考验一下他是否愿意对夫人毫无秘密。维尔迪兰，他是否可以加入‘小家族’。如果他没能通过，介绍他的忠实人就会被拉到一边，并被巧妙地协助与朋友或情妇争吵。但如果测试结果令人满意，新来者就会被列为“忠实者”。因此，在同一年，妓女告诉维尔迪兰先生，她认识了一位如此迷人的绅士，斯万先生暗示他非常希望被允许来，维尔迪兰先生立即向他的妻子提出了这个请求。在她形成自己的观点之前，他从未对任何主题形成过意见，他的特殊职责是实现她和一般“信徒”的愿望，他以无限的聪明才智做到了这一点。

‘My dear, Mme. de Crécy has something to say to you. She would like to bring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?’
“亲爱的，夫人。德·克雷西有话要对你说。她想带她的一位朋友来这里，斯旺先生。你怎么说？'

‘Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a piece of perfection.’
‘哎呀，好像任何人都可以拒绝任何一点点完美的东西一样。安静;没有人询问你的意见。我告诉你，你是一个完美的人。

‘Just as you like,’ replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: ‘You know I’m not fishing for compliments.’
“随你便。”奥黛特装腔作势地回答，然后继续说道：“你知道我并不是在寻求恭维。”

‘Very well; bring your friend, if he’s nice.’
'很好;带上你的朋友吧，如果他友善的话。

Now there was no connection whatsoever between the ‘little nucleus’ and the society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and ‘bounders’ that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would instantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace’s maid.
现在，“小核心”和斯旺经常光顾的社交圈子之间没有任何联系，一个纯粹世俗的人会认为，当他在世界上占据如此特殊的地位时，不值得花时间去寻求维尔迪兰家族的介绍。 。但斯万是一个如此热心的情人，一旦他认识了几乎所有的贵族女性，一旦她们教了他所有需要学习的东西，他就不再考虑那些几乎是贵族专利的入籍文件，圣日耳曼郊区授予他一种可流通的债券，一种没有内在价值的信用证，这使他能够在该国的某个小洞或某个不起眼的地方为自己临时谋取一个地位巴黎的一位当地乡绅或律师的漂亮女儿迷上了他。因为在这种时候，欲望，或者说爱本身，会在他心中重新燃起一种虚荣感，而现在他在日常生活中已经完全摆脱了这种虚荣感，尽管毫无疑问，正是这种感觉最初促使他作为一名职业生涯的职业者。他把自己的才智浪费在无聊的娱乐上，利用自己在艺术方面的博学只为上流社会的女士们提供建议，告诉她该买什么画，如何装饰她们的房子。正是这种虚荣心使他渴望在任何暂时迷住他的无名之辈面前闪闪发光，这种光彩是斯万这个名字本身所无法散发出来的。当这个默默无闻的人处于卑微的境地时，他是最渴望的。 正如聪明人害怕的不是其他聪明人认为自己是傻瓜一样，时尚人士也害怕发现自己的社会价值被低估，而不是伟大的绅士，而是粗鲁的人和“无知的人”。 。自从世界诞生以来，人们所表现出的聪明才智和散布的社会谎言，有四分之三是针对低等人的，而这些谎言只会削弱人们的重要性。而斯万，举止很简单，和公爵夫人在一起时很自在，如果他见到公爵夫人的女仆，他会因为害怕被鄙视而颤抖，并立即开始摆出姿势。

Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly ‘common’ type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman’s face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh.
与许多人不同的是，他们要么是因为缺乏精力，要么是因为对自己的社会地位所赋予的义务的一种放弃感，要像船屋一样停泊在生命之河岸上的某个点，而放弃享乐。提供给他们高于和低于这一点的生活程度，他们将保持固定的生活程度，直到他们死亡的那一天，并且最终满足于将那些平庸的干扰描述为快乐，因为没有更好的东西。 ，那只是与它们一起封闭的令人难以忍受的单调乏味；斯旺不会努力在他必须与之共度时光的女人身上寻找魅力和美丽，而是在他已经发现的美丽和迷人的女人中度过他的时光。这些女性的美丽往往属于明显“普通”类型，因为那些本能地、无缘无故地吸引他的身体素质，与他所欣赏的画家所画或雕塑的女性的身体素质截然相反。他最喜欢的大师。性格的深度，或者女人脸上忧郁的表情会让他的感官冻结，但是，当看到健康、丰富、红润的人肉时，他的感官就会立即融化。

If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his ‘high horse’ and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at ‘views’ of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that ‘Life’ contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody’s cook.
如果他在旅行中遇到了一个家庭，他最好不要试图去了解这个家庭，但其中一个女人引起了他的注意，她带着一种对他来说陌生的特殊魅力，让他保持在“高潮”。 ”并欺骗她在他心中点燃的欲望，通过写信邀请他的一位前情妇来加入他的方式来代替他在她的陪伴下可能品尝到的不同的快乐，在他看来，这就像他在生活面前懦弱地放弃了自己，愚蠢地放弃了一种新的幸福形式，就好像他没有去他所在的国家，而是把自己关在自己的房间里，看巴黎的“风景”。他并没有将自己束缚在牢固的社会关系结构中，而是将其构建起来，以便能够在任何女人可能喜欢的地方将其重新建立在新的基础上，就像探险家随身携带的那种可折叠的帐篷之一跟他们。任何不可携带或无法适应某种新鲜乐趣的部分，他都会认为毫无价值而丢弃，无论它在其他人看来多么令人羡慕。有多少次，他在一位公爵夫人那里的信誉是建立在她每年都想帮他一些忙的愿望之上的，而她却从未找到机会，却因为他在措辞不谨慎的信息中对她的召唤而瞬间被浪费掉了。通过电报推荐，他可以立即与她的一位特工取得联系，他在乡下注意到了她的女儿，就像一个饥饿的人可以用钻石换取一块面包一样。事实上，当为时已晚时，他会为此嘲笑自己，因为他的本性中有一种滑稽的成分，经过许多罕见的优雅的救赎。 那么他就属于这一类聪明人，他们过着游手好闲的生活，他们寻求安慰，也许还从他们的游手好闲为他们的聪明才智提供的想法中寻求安慰，也许还有一个借口，那就是那些值得他们感兴趣的物体。可以通过艺术或学习来获得，“生活”包含比所有浪漫故事更有趣、更浪漫的情境。因此，至少他会向他保证，并且毫不费力地说服他在时尚界的朋友中比较狡猾的人，尤其是夏吕斯男爵，他喜欢用发生在他身上的惊人冒险的故事来逗他开心，比如当他在火车上遇到了一个女人，并把她带回家，然后发现她是一位在位君主的妹妹，在那一刻，他手中聚集了欧洲政治的所有线索，他发现了这些线索。他自己以最令人愉快的方式随时了解情况，或者在情况复杂的情况下，这取决于秘密会议即将做出的选择，他是否会成为某人厨师的情人。

It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive ‘affairs’ and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann’s great ‘affair’ began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend’s handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: ‘Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!’ And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted.
斯旺之所以被迫以如此多的愤世嫉俗的态度来充当他的迎合者，不仅是因为他与贤惠的太后、将军和学者组成的才华横溢的方阵，他们与他们有着如此密切的联系。他所有的朋友都习惯于时不时地收到一封信，要求他们做一些推荐或介绍，他的外交手腕在他接连不断的“事务”中始终如一，并使用不同的借口，表现得比他的外交手腕更加明显。最笨拙的轻率行为，是他性格中的永久特征和不变的追求。我经常对自己回忆起，许多年后，我开始对他的性格感兴趣，因为他的性格在完全不同的方面与我自己的性格有相似之处，当他给我的祖父写信时（虽然不是在我们现在考虑的时间，因为斯万的伟大“风流韵事”正是在我出生的那一天开始的，并在他的恋爱实践中造成了长时间的中断）后者认出了他朋友在信封上的笔迹，惊呼：“这是斯万要的东西；警惕！”而且，要么是出于不信任，要么是出于无意识的邪恶精神，这种精神促使我们只向那些不想要的人提供东西，我的祖父母会遭到他最容易满足的祈祷的顽固拒绝，就像当他恳求他们介绍一个每周日和我们一起吃饭的女孩，每当斯旺提到她时，他们都不得不假装他们不再见面，尽管他们会想知道，整个星期，他们可以邀请谁去见她，但最终却常常找不到人，比向他打个手势让他欣然接受。

Occasionally a couple of my grandparents’ acquaintance, who had been complaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce with satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my grandmother, as he hummed the air of:
偶尔，我祖父母的几个熟人，一直抱怨他们现在再也见不到斯旺了，会满意地宣布，也许还带着一丝让我祖父母羡慕的倾向，说他突然变得像斯万一样迷人。他有可能是，而且从来没有离开过他们的房子。爷爷不愿意去打破他们美好的幻想，只是看着奶奶，嘴里哼着：

What is this mystery? I cannot understand it;
这到底是什么奥秘呢？我不明白;

or of:
或：

Vision fugitive...; In matters such as this ‘Tis best to close one’s eyes.
愿景逃亡者……；在这种事情上，最好闭上眼睛。

A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann’s new friend ‘What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?’ the other’s face would lengthen: ‘Never mention his name to me again!’
几个月后，如果我的祖父问斯旺的新朋友‘斯旺呢？你还和以前一样经常见到他吗？”对方的脸拉长了：“永远不要再对我提起他的名字！”

‘But I thought that you were such friends...’
“但我以为你们是这样的朋友……”

He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform.
几个月以来，他一直以这种方式与我祖母的一些表兄弟保持亲密关系，几乎每天晚上都在他们家吃饭。突然，在没有任何警告的情况下，他不再出现了。他们以为他病了，女主人正​​要派人去探望他，这时，她在厨房里发现了他手里的一封信，这是她的厨师不小心留在家务簿上的。他在信中宣布，他将离开巴黎，并且无法再回到家中。厨师是他的情妇，在断绝关系的那一刻，她是家里唯一一个他认为有必要通知的人。

But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in ‘society,’ then for her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her. ‘No good depending on Swann for this evening,’ people would say; ‘don’t you remember, it’s his American’s night at the Opera?’ He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight ‘wave’ imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love.
但当他的情妇暂时是一个上流社会的女人，或者至少出身不那么低贱，地位也不那么不正常，以至于他无法安排她在“上流社会”受到接待时，那么为了她，他就返回到它，但仅限于她移动或他吸引她进入的特定轨道。人们会说：“今晚依靠斯旺是没有好处的。” “你不记得了，这是他在歌剧院的美国之夜吗？”他会邀请她去最独特的客厅，去那些他自己经常去的房子，参加每周的晚餐或玩扑克；每天晚上，在他那硬邦邦的红发上轻轻一“挥动”，使他那双大胆的绿眼睛的热情变得柔和一些之后，他就会选择一朵花插在扣眼上，然后出发去一个人的家里迎接他的情妇。或他圈子里的其他女性；然后，想到当他在那里遇见他所爱的女人时，他总是按照他喜欢的方式对待时尚人士，他们会向他倾注感情和钦佩，他会发现一种新鲜的魅力他已经厌倦了这个世俗的存在，但他融入其中的闪烁光芒，使他的物质弥漫着温暖的色彩，在他看来，它是美丽而稀有的，因为他在其中融入了新鲜的爱。

But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Crécy by an old friend of his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest her so much, she, ‘an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,’ saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his ‘home,’ where she imagined him to be ‘so comfortable with his tea and his books”; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was ‘not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man.’ And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would appear—since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure—that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice.
但是，虽然每一次依恋，每一次调情或多或少都是对一个梦想的实现，这个梦想是由斯万自发地、不费吹灰之力地发现的一张脸或一个形状而产生的，他觉得很迷人，但另一回事是，有一天在剧院，他的一位老朋友把他介绍给奥黛特·德·克雷西，这位老友对他说，她是一个令人着迷的女人，他很可能会与她达成谅解；但他的表现却完全不同。但把她表现得比实际情况更难征服，以便通过介绍显得她受到了特殊的照顾。当然，她给斯旺的印象并不是缺乏美感，而是赋予了他一种冷漠的美感，这种美感没有激起他的欲望，事实上，这给了他一种身体上的排斥感。作为那些每个男人都能说出一些名字的女性之一，每个人都会举出不同的例子，她们与我们的感官所要求的类型相反。为了给他带来任何乐趣，她的轮廓太尖锐，她的皮肤太细腻，她的颧骨太突出，她的五官太紧致。她的眼睛很好，但太大了，似乎在自身重量的作用下弯曲，拉紧了她脸上的其他部分，总是让她看起来不舒服或心情不好。 在剧院的介绍之后一段时间，她写信询问斯旺是否可以看看他的收藏品，这会让她非常感兴趣，她，“一个对美丽事物有品味的无知女人”，说当她看到他的作品时，她会更了解他。有一次她在他的“家里”见过他，想象他“对茶和书感到如此自在”；尽管她并没有掩饰对他出现在镇上那个地方的惊讶，那地方一定很令人沮丧，而且“对于这样一个非常聪明的男人来说，他还不够聪明。”当他允许她来时，她对他说当她离开时，她非常遗憾在这座房子里呆了这么短的时间，她很高兴终于找到了自己的路，说起他就好像他对她来说比其他人更重要。他知道，并且似乎以一种浪漫的纽带将他们两个人结合在一起，这让他微笑起来。但在人生的阶段，斯万正在接近这种幻灭的感觉，当一个人可以满足于为了爱的快乐而恋爱，而不期望太多的回报时，这种心灵的联系，如果不再，就像在青年时代一样，爱必然趋向的目标仍然通过如此强烈的观念联系而束缚于爱，以至于如果它首先出现，它很可能成为爱的原因。年轻时，男人梦想着能占有自己所爱女人的心；后来，他拥有一颗女人心的感觉也许就足以让他爱上她了。 50岁，在这个年纪——因为一个人在爱情中首先寻求的是一种主观的快乐——对女性美的品味必须在其生育中发挥更大的作用，爱情可能会出现，最肉体的爱情，没有任何欲望的基础。人在人生的这个阶段，已经不止一次地被爱情的箭刺伤了。在他被动而惊讶的心面前，它不再自行演化，遵循着它自己不可理解的致命法则。我们来帮助它；我们通过记忆和暗示来伪造它；认识到其中一种症状，我们就会回忆并重现其余的症状。既然我们拥有这首赞美诗，将其完整地铭刻在我们的心上，那么就不需要任何女人重复她的美丽所激发的钦佩的开场诗句，让我们记住接下来的一切。如果她从中间开始，唱出我们的存在，从今往后，只为彼此，我们就足够适应这种音乐，能够在第一次停顿时毫不犹豫地拿起它并跟随我们的伴侣。她的声音。

Odette de Crécy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent, and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette’s face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely buried.
奥黛特·德·克雷西再次来看望斯万。她的来访变得越来越频繁，毫无疑问，每次来访都会使他再次感到失望，因为他在看到这张脸时所感到的失望感在这段时间里他已经忘记了她的细节，不记得她是如此富有表现力，或者尽管她很年轻，但他却忘记了她的细节。褪色了；当她与他交谈时，他常常感到遗憾，因为她真正的美貌并不是他自发欣赏的那种。 必须指出的是，奥黛特的脸比实际情况显得更瘦、更突出，因为她的前额和脸颊的上部是一个几乎平坦的表面，上面覆盖着当时妇女所留的大量头发，刘海向前，卷曲的波浪卷起，散乱的发绺垂在耳朵上；至于她的身材，她的身材令人赞叹，但由于紧身胸衣的存在，不可能看出其连续性（考虑到当时流行的时尚，尽管她是巴黎穿着最好的女性之一），向前呈拱形，仿佛在想象中的肚子上，最后是一个尖点，在尖点下，双裙子的气球鼓起来，使那一年的女人看起来像是由不同的部分组成的，但很不合适。在这种程度上，褶边、荷叶边、内部紧身胸衣完全独立，仅受设计师的奇思妙想或材料的刚性控制，将它们引向丝带结、蕾丝垂坠的线条，垂直悬挂的黑玉的边缘，或沿着半身像携带它们，但没有任何地方将自己附着在生物上，根据它们的华丽结构将它们吸引到或远离她自己的，发现自己要么被束缚窒息，要么否则完全被掩埋。

But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. ‘And won’t you,’ she had ventured, ‘come just once and take tea with me?’ He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay—which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago—on Vermeer of Delft. ‘I know that I am quite useless,’ she had replied, ‘a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!’ she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her ‘hands right in the dish itself.’ ‘You will only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,’ she meant Vermeer, ‘I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say ‘There, that’s what he’s thinking about!’ What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.’
但是，在奥黛特离开他之后，斯万会微笑着想起她告诉他，在他允许她再次到来之前，时间会多么漫长；他会告诉他，时间会多么漫长。他记得她曾经焦急而胆怯地恳求他不要待太久，还记得她当时看着他的方式，她用恐惧和恳求的目光注视着他，这让她的气质显得很动人。一束束人造三色堇固定在她白色稻草圆帽的前面，并用黑色天鹅绒绳子系着。 “你不想来一次，和我一起喝茶吗？”她大胆地说，“他以工作压力为借口，写了一篇关于代尔夫特的维米尔的文章——事实上，他几年前就放弃了。” “我知道我很没用，”她回答道，“在像你这样博学的伟人身边，我就是个小野人。”我应该像寓言中的青蛙一样！但我还是非常喜欢学习、了解事物、受到启发。成为一个普通的书虫，把鼻子埋在大量的旧报纸里，该多有趣啊！”她继续说道，带着一种聪明女人在坚称她唯一的愿望就是奉献自己时所表现出的一种自鸣得意的神情。不用担心弄脏她的手指，去做一些不干净的工作，比如做饭，她“双手放在盘子里。”“你只会嘲笑我，但这个画家阻止你看到我，”她指的是维米尔，“我什至从未听说过他；”他还活着吗？我能在巴黎看到他的任何东西吗？以便了解一下他辛勤工作的大额头背后发生的事情，我确信他的头脑总是在思考问题；只是能够说“好了，这就是他正在想的！”能够帮助您完成工作将是多么梦想啊。

He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. ‘You are afraid of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!’ she had said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched. ‘Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest are all like her. She can’t have understood you: you are so utterly different from ordinary men. That’s what I liked about you when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren’t like everybody else.’
他为自己害怕建立新的友谊而寻找借口，他勇敢地将其描述为他对绝望的激情的恐惧。 ‘你害怕坠入爱河吗？这是多么有趣啊，当我四处寻找别的东西，愿意付出我的灵魂，只是为了在某个地方找到一点爱！”她说道，语气如此自然，语气如此坚定，以至于他真的被感动了。 “肯定是某个女人让你受苦了。而你以为其他人都像她一样。她不可能理解你：你和普通男人截然不同。这就是我第一次见到你时就喜欢你的地方；我立刻就觉得你和其他人不一样。

‘And then, besides, there’s yourself——‘ he had continued, ‘I know what women are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time to spare.’
“此外，还有你自己——”他继续说道，“我知道女人是什么；我知道女人是什么。”你必须有一大堆事情要做，而且没有空闲时间。”

‘I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like—to introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my finding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone.’
'我？为什么，我从来没有什么事可做。我永远是自由的，如果你需要我，我将永远自由。无论白天还是晚上，无论您什么时候想见我，只要派人来找我，我都会很高兴来的。你会这么做吗？你知道我真正喜欢什么吗——把你介绍给夫人。维尔迪兰，我每天晚上都去的地方。想象一下我在那里找到了你，并认为你离开是为了我。

No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if, thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Crécy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann’s taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish.
毫无疑问，当他独自一人时，他如此回忆起他们的谈话，如此想着她，只不过是在他浪漫的梦中将她的形象融入到无数其他女人的形象中；但是，如果由于某种偶然的情况（或者甚至可能没有这种帮助，因为当一种迄今为止潜在的心理状态被感觉到时，出现的情况很可能对该状态没有任何影响），奥黛特·德·克雷西的形象逐渐吸收了他的全部梦境，如果梦中对她的记忆无法再被消除，那么她身体的缺陷就不再是最不重要的了，她身体的一致性也不再是最重要的了。或低于任何其他，以满足斯旺的品味要求；因为，既然已经成为了他所爱的她的身体，那么从今以后，它必定是唯一能够给他带来快乐或痛苦的身体了。

It so happened that my grandfather had known—which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance—the family of these Ver-durins. But he had entirely severed his connection with what he called ‘young Verdurin,’ taking a general view of him as one who had fallen—though without losing hold of his millions—among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One day he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the Verdurins. ‘On guard! on guard!’ he exclaimed as he read it, ‘I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don’t mix myself up in such matters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after the little Verdurins.’
碰巧我的祖父认识——这比任何其他真正的熟人都多——这些维尔迪兰家族的人。但他完全断绝了与他所谓的“年轻维尔迪兰”的联系，普遍认为他是一个堕落到波西米亚的流氓之中的人，尽管他并没有失去数百万美元。有一天，他收到斯旺的一封信，询问我的祖父是否可以让他与维尔迪兰家族取得联系。 '处于戒备！警惕！”他读到这封信时大声说道，“我一点也不感到惊讶；斯旺注定会以这样的结局收场。很多人都很好！我不能按照他的要求去做，因为首先，我不再认识这位先生了。再说了，这里面一定有女人，我不会卷入这种事的。啊，好吧，如果斯旺开始追赶小维尔迪兰，我们会看到一些有趣的事情。

And on my grandfather’s refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house.
当我祖父拒绝充当担保人时，奥黛特亲自带斯万去了家里。

The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the ‘faithful.’
斯万第一次露面的那天，维尔迪兰夫妇与他们一起吃饭。科塔尔、年轻的钢琴家和他的姨妈以及当时的画家都表示支持，而当晚，又有几位“忠实信徒”加入了他们的行列。

Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: ‘Do you really mean that?’ He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own.
科塔德博士从来不太确定他应该用什么语气来回答任何评论，或者说话者是在开玩笑还是认真的。因此，无论如何，他都会用一个有条件的、临时的微笑来修饰他所有的面部表情，如果对他说的话被证明是开玩笑的话，这个微笑的期待微妙将使他免于被指控为傻瓜。但由于他也必须做好面对另一种选择的准备，所以他从来不敢让这种微笑在他的脸上有明确的表情，你会看到那里永远闪烁着不确定性，你可以在其中解读出他从来不敢问的问题： “你真的是这个意思吗？”他对自己在街上或生活中应该采取的行为方式并不比在客厅里更有信心。人们可能会看到他带着恶意的微笑向路人、马车和任何发生的事情打招呼，这免除了他随后的所有不当行为，因为这证明，如果结果不适合这个场合，他很清楚这一点，如果他假装微笑，那么这个笑话就是他自己的秘密。

On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education.
然而，在所有这些问题上，只要博士认为可以提出一个简单的问题，他就会不遗余力地努力培养他的无知和不确定性，从而完成他的教育。

So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it.
所以，在他第一次从乡下来到京城时，按照一位明智母亲的建议，他决不会轻易放过对他来说陌生的修辞手法或专有名词。确保其上有最完整的信息。

As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended by those which he most frequently heard used: ‘devilish pretty,’ ‘blue blood,’ ‘a cat and dog life,’ ‘a day of reckoning,’ ‘a queen of fashion, ‘to give a free hand,’ ‘to be at a deadlock,’ and so forth; and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other ‘plays upon words’ which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek.
至于修辞格，他对知识的渴求永无止境，因为他经常想象它们具有比实际情况更明确的含义，他想知道他最常听到的那些修辞格的确切含义是什么。 ：“恶魔般的漂亮”、“贵族血统”、“猫狗生活”、“清算日”、“时尚女王”、“放开手脚”、“陷入僵局”等等向前;以及在什么特定情况下他本人可能会在谈话中使用它们。如果做不到这些，他就会用双关语和其他他死记硬背的“文字游戏”来装饰它。至于在他耳边说出的陌生人的名字，他只是用询问的语气向自己重复一遍，他认为这足以为他提供表面上不会寻求的解释。

As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: ‘It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I’m sure you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I’m afraid we’re rather too near the stage,’ the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied: ‘To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you, you are so good.’ And he went on, ‘Sarah Bernhardt; that’s what they call the Voice of God, ain’t it? You see, often, too, that she ‘sets the boards on fire.’ That’s an odd expression, ain’t it?’ in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming.
他引以为傲的批判能力实际上完全缺乏良好教养的精炼，这种能力在于向你以任何方式提供帮助的人保证，你不希望别人相信你的做法。事实上，你自己对他有恩惠，浪费在科塔尔身上，科塔尔把他听到的一切都按照字面意思理解。不管她对他的错误有多盲目，夫人。维尔迪兰确实很生气，尽管她仍然认为他非常聪明，当她邀请他在舞台包厢里看莎拉·伯恩哈特并听她讲话并礼貌地说：“你能来真是太好了，博士，尤其是我相信您一定经常听说过莎拉·伯恩哈特（Sarah Bernhardt）；此外，我担心我们离舞台太近了。”博士带着微笑走进了包厢，笑容一直在他脸上停留或消失，直到某个权威人士向他阐明这一点。 ” 回答道：“可以肯定的是，我们离舞台太近了，人们已经厌倦了莎拉·伯恩哈特。但你表达了我应该来的愿望。对我来说，你的愿望就是命令。我很高兴能为您提供这项小服务。 “你太棒了。”他接着说道，“莎拉·伯恩哈特；莎拉·伯恩哈特；这就是他们所说的上帝之声，不是吗？你也经常看到她“放火烧木板”。这是一个奇怪的表达方式，不是吗？”希望得到启发性的评论，然而，这一评论并没有出现。

‘D’you know,’ Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, ‘I believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he accepts everything that we say as gospel.’
“你知道吗，”夫人。维尔迪兰对她的丈夫说：“我相信，当我们贬低我们为医生提供的任何东西时，我们就走上了错误的工作方式。”他是一位科学家，他的生活与我们的日常生活截然不同。他自己对事物的价值一无所知，他接受我们所说的一切作为福音。

‘I never dared to mention it,’ M. Verdurin had answered, ‘but I’ve noticed the same thing myself.’ And on the following New Year’s Day, instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match.
“我从来不敢提这件事，”维尔迪兰先生回答道，“但我自己也注意到了同样的事情。”在接下来的元旦，他没有给科塔尔医生寄去一颗价值三千法郎的红宝石，而是维尔迪兰先生假装这只是一件小事，花了三百块钱买了一块人造石，并让人们知道这是几乎不可能比拟的东西。

When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that evening; ‘Swann!’ the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, ‘Swann! Who on earth is Swann?’ he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, ‘Why, Odette’s friend, whom she told us about.’
当女士。维尔迪兰宣布，他们要在那天晚上去见斯旺先生。 “斯旺！”博士惊呼道，他的语气因惊讶而变得残酷，因为即使是最小的消息也总是会让这个自以为随时准备应对任何事情的人完全措手不及。看到没有人回答他，“斯旺！” “斯旺到底是谁？”他惊慌失措地喊道，但随着夫人的到来，这种焦虑就平息了。维尔迪兰解释道：“哦，奥黛特的朋友，她向我们提起过。”

‘Ah, good, good; that’s all right, then,’ answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann’s appearing at the Verdurins’, because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers’ meetings. ‘Nothing amuses me more than match-making,’ he confided to Cottard; ‘I have been tremendously successful, even with women!’
‘啊，好，好；那就没关系了，”博士立刻平静下来回答道。至于画家，他对斯旺出现在维尔迪兰家的前景感到欣喜若狂，因为他认为斯旺爱上了奥黛特，并且随时准备在情人聚会上提供协助。 “没有什么比牵线搭桥更让我开心的了，”他向科塔尔吐露道。 “我取得了巨大的成功，即使是在女性方面！”

In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely ‘smart,’ Odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another ‘bore.’ When he arrived, however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which, though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movemsnt of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann’s social deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their ‘bores’ would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which Cottard styled ‘letting ‘em all come’), Swann supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some house of ‘ill-fame,’ though these he himself very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately, in his wife’s hearing, have made any allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor’s expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him very pleasant. ‘Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have been,’ Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour, ‘perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard’s portrait’ (for which she had given the painter a commission). ‘Take care, Master Biche,’ she reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as ‘Master,’ ‘to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that’s what I’ve asked you to paint—the portrait of his smile.’ And since the phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the cop-sonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the distinction: ‘M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette’) but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann’s next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist’s aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.
奥黛特告诉韦尔迪兰一家，斯万极其“聪明”，这让他们担心另一个“讨厌鬼”的前景。然而，当他到达时，他给人留下了极好的印象，这是一个间接原因，尽管他们不知道这一点，是他对上流社会的熟悉程度。事实上，他拥有那些在这个世界上生活和活动过的人比其他人，甚至是那些从未进入社会的聪明而有教养的人所享有的优势之一，即他们不再看到社会因渴望或排斥而变形。它充满了想象力，但又认为它并不重要。他们善良的天性，没有势利的污点，也没有对显得过于友好的恐惧，变得独立，事实上，拥有训练有素的体操运动员的轻松、优雅的动作，他们的每一个柔软的四肢都会精确地执行所要求的动作。他身体的其他部分不需要任何笨拙的参与。当一个国际人士礼貌地向被介绍给他的陌生青年伸出手时，当他在被介绍给他的大使面前小心地鞠躬时，他所使用的简单而基本的手势已经逐渐普及，而无需担心。他意识到了斯万的整个社会举止，因此，在与比他等级低的人在一起时，例如维尔迪兰夫妇和他们的朋友，他本能地表现出殷勤，并提出了主动表示，通过他们的帐户，他们的任何“无聊”都会被分配。见到博士后，他浑身发冷，尽管只有片刻。 科塔尔；在他们互相交谈之前，看到他闭上一只眼睛，带着一种模棱两可的微笑（科塔尔称之为“让他们都来”的鬼脸），斯旺认为博士认出了他，因为他已经在某个地方见过他了。一些“名声不佳”的房子，尽管他本人很少去这些地方，从来没有养成沉迷于唯利是图的爱情的习惯。斯万认为这样的暗示是低俗的，尤其是在奥黛特面前，因为这很容易使奥黛特对自己的看法变得更糟，斯万表现出他最冷漠的态度。但当他得知医生旁边的那位女士是夫人时。科塔尔先生，​​他认为如此年轻的丈夫不会故意在妻子的耳中提及此类娱乐，因此不再按照他最初怀疑的方式解释医生的表情。画家立即邀请斯万和奥黛特一起参观他的工作室，斯万觉得他很愉快。 “也许你会比我受到更多的青睐，”夫人。维尔迪兰打断道，假装对这种恩惠表示不满，“也许你会被允许看看科塔尔的肖像”（为此她给了这位画家委托）。 “保重，比什大师，”她提醒这位画家，“捕捉他眼中美丽的神情和诙谐的小光芒。”称呼他为“大师”是一种由来已久的乐趣。你知道，我最想要的就是他的笑容；这就是我要你画的——他的微笑肖像。”由于这句话让她觉得值得注意，她大声地重复了一遍，以确保尽可能多的客人听到它，然后甚至还用了一些不确定的借口，将圈子拉近了一些，才再次开口。 斯万恳求把他介绍给每个人，甚至是维尔迪兰家族的一位老朋友，名叫萨尼埃特，由于他的古文字学技巧、巨额财富和显赫的家族，他的害羞、单纯和善良使他失去了所有的关注。他属于其中。当他说话时，他的话语带着一种令人愉悦的困惑，因为人们觉得这与其说表明了他讲话中的缺陷，不如说表明了他灵魂的品质，因为这是他从未经历过的纯真时代的残余。完全超出了。所有他无法发音的辅音似乎都像是他温柔的嘴唇无法发出的刺耳话语。通过要求让萨尼埃特先生认识，斯旺让维尔迪兰先生扭转了通常的介绍形式（事实上，强调了区别：“斯旺先生，请让我向您介绍我们的朋友萨尼埃特”）但他在萨尼埃特身上激起了一种温暖的感激之情，然而，维尔迪兰夫妇从未向斯万透露过，因为萨尼埃特相当惹恼他们，而他们也没有义务为他提供朋友。另一方面，维尔迪兰夫妇对斯万的下一个请求非常感动，因为他觉得他必须要求被介绍给钢琴家的姨妈。她穿着黑色连衣裙，这是她一贯的习惯，因为她相信女人穿黑色总是很好看，没有什么比这更显眼的了。但她的脸却非常红，饭后有一段时间她总是这样。她恭敬地向斯旺鞠了一躬，但又非常庄严地挺直身子。 由于她完全没有受过教育，又怕在语法和发音上犯错误，所以她说话时故意含糊不清、乱码，以为自己说错了就会被埋在周围的混乱之中，没人能听懂。确定她是否真的成功了；结果，她的谈话就像是一种连续的、模糊的咳痰，偶尔会出现一些她感到积极的声音和音节。斯万认为自己有权在与维尔迪兰先生交谈时对她开一点温和的玩笑，然而维尔迪兰先生却一点也不觉得好笑。

‘She is such an excellent woman!’ he rejoined. ‘I grant you that she is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her.’
“她是一位非常优秀的女人！”他回答道。 “我承认她并不十分聪明；但她确实很聪明。”但我向你保证，当你单独和她在一起时，她会说得最迷人。”

‘I am sure she can,’ Swann hastened to conciliate him. ‘All I meant was that she hardly struck me as ‘distinguished,’’ he went on, isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, ‘and, after all, that is something of a compliment.’
“我相信她可以，”斯万赶紧安抚他。 “我的意思是，她几乎没有给我留下‘杰出’的印象，”他继续说道，用他的语气用引号分隔出这个绰号，“毕竟，这是一种恭维。”

‘Wait a moment,’ said M. Verdurin, ‘now, this will surprise you; she writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M. Swann?’
“等一下，”维尔迪兰先生说，“现在，这会让你大吃一惊的；”她写得非常愉快。你从来没有听过她侄子演奏吗？这是令人钦佩的；呃，医生？斯旺先生，你想让我请他演奏一些东西吗？

‘I should count myself most fortunate...’ Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word ‘fortunate’ had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old ‘tag’ or ‘saw,’ however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind.
“我应该认为自己是最幸运的……”斯万正要开口，有点傲慢，这时博士嘲笑地插话道。他曾经听过这句话，并且永远不会忘记，在一般谈话中强调和使用正式的表达方式已经过时了，每当他听到一个严肃的词被严肃地使用时，就像斯万刚才使用的“幸运”这个词一样，他我立刻就认为说话者是故意迂腐的。此外，如果同一个词也碰巧出现在他所谓的旧“标签”或“锯子”中，无论它在当前的用法中多么常见，博士都会立即得出结论，整个事情是一个他开玩笑地打断了引文的其余部分，他似乎责怪说话者本来打算在这一点上介绍这句话，尽管实际上他从未想到过这一点。

‘Most fortunate for France!’ he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.
“法国最幸运！”他邪恶地背诵着，同时用力地举起双臂。维尔迪兰先生忍不住笑了。

‘What are all those good people laughing at over there? There’s no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner,’ shouted Mme. Verdurin. ‘You don’t suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance,’ she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.
‘那边那些好人在笑什么呢？你的角落里没有任何忧郁的迹象。”夫人喊道。韦尔迪兰。 “你以为我一个人被困在悔改的凳子上不会觉得很有趣吗？”她像个被宠坏的孩子一样，脾气暴躁地继续说道。

Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school ‘form,’ and ‘swore,’ as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her ‘faithful’ were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects.
女士。维尔迪兰坐在一张瑞典打蜡松木高椅上，这是一位瑞典小提琴家送给她的，她把它放在客厅里，尽管从外观上看，它暗示着一种学校的“形式”，并且“发誓”，俗话说，看她拥有的真正好的古董家具；但她特意保存了她的“忠实信徒”不时为她准备的礼物，以便捐赠者来到家里时可以很高兴看到这些礼物。她试图说服他们只献上鲜花和糖果，因为它们至少具有死亡的价值。但她从未成功，房子里逐渐堆满了暖脚器、垫子、时钟、屏风、气压计和花瓶，这些无用但坚不可摧的物品不断重复和无限不协调。

>From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the ‘faithful,’ and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was ‘laughing until she cried.’ At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a ‘bore,’ or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of ‘bores’—and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the ‘real thing,’ was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity—she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the ‘faithful,’ drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling.
>站在这个崇高的地位上，她会热情地参与“信徒”的谈话，并陶醉在他们所有的乐趣中；但是，自从下巴受伤后，她放弃了真正的欢闹，取而代之的是一种象征性的哑剧，这种哑剧表明她“笑到哭为止”，但不会以任何方式危及甚至使她疲劳。至少，这个圈子里的任何一个人都会针对一个“无聊”的人，或者一个现在被降级到“无聊”边缘的圈子里的前成员，进行一些俏皮话——这让维尔迪兰先生彻底绝望了，他总是表现出他和他妻子一样容易被逗乐，但由于他的笑声是“真实的”，他的妻子立刻就气喘吁吁，因此被她假装但持续的欢闹所超越和征服。 ——她会发出一声尖锐的叫声，紧紧闭上那双小鸟般的眼睛，那双眼睛已经开始被白内障遮住了，然后很快地，仿佛她只有时间来避免一些不雅的景象或招架致命的一击，她把脸埋在双手中，双手完全吞没了脸，根本看不到任何东西，她似乎在努力抑制、消除笑声，如果她屈服于笑声，她必然会变得毫无生气。因此，夫人对“忠实者”的欢乐感到震惊，沉迷于同志情谊、丑闻和主张。维尔迪兰坐在高高的座位上，就像一只笼中鸟，饼干浸在热红酒里，她会坐在高处哭泣，同情心。

Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann’s permission to light his pipe (“No ceremony here, you understand; we’re all pals!’), went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano.
与此同时，维尔迪兰先生首先请求斯旺允许点燃他的烟斗（“这里没有仪式，你明白；我们都是朋友！”），然后请求这位年轻的音乐家在钢琴前坐下。

‘Leave him alone; don’t bother him; he hasn’t come here to be tormented,’ cried Mme. Verdurin. ‘I won’t have him tormented.’
'留下他一个人;不要打扰他；他来这里不是为了受折磨的，”夫人喊道。韦尔迪兰。 “我不会让他受到折磨。”

‘But why on earth should it bother him?’ rejoined M. Verdurin. ‘I’m sure M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.’
“但是这到底为什么要让他烦恼呢？”维尔迪兰先生反问道。 “我确信斯旺先生从未听过我们发现的升F奏鸣曲；他将为我们演奏钢琴改编曲。

‘No, no, no, not my sonata!’ she screamed, ‘I don’t want to be made to cry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last time; thanks very much, I don’t intend to repeat that performance; you are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed, for a week.’
“不，不，不，这不是我的奏鸣曲！”她尖叫道，“我不想像上次一样，一直哭到头感冒，脸上神经痛；非常感谢，我不打算重复那个表演；你们都非常善良、体贴；很容易看出，你们中的任何一个人都不需要在床上呆一个星期。

This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive originality of the ‘Mistress’ as she was styled, and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical ‘ear.’ Those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room, by their cries of ‘Hear, hear!’ which, as in Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the ‘little scene’ had never been so amusingly done.
这个小场景，每当这位年轻的钢琴家坐下来演奏时，都会被重演，总是让观众感到高兴，就好像他们每个人都是第一次目睹它一样，作为“她被称为“情妇”，以及她对音乐“耳朵”的敏锐敏感性。离她最近的人会通过喊叫“”来吸引其他人的注意，他们在房间的另一端抽烟或打牌。听听，听听！”就像在议会辩论中一样，这表明正在说一些值得听的事情。第二天，他们会对那些当晚被阻止来的人表示同情，并向他们保证这个“小场景”从来没有做得这么有趣。

‘Well, all right, then,’ said M. Verdurin, ‘he can play just the andante.’
“好吧，那么，”维尔迪兰先生说，“他只会演奏行板。”

‘Just the andante! How you do go on,’ cried his wife. ‘As if it weren’t ‘just the andante’ that breaks every bone in my body. The ‘Master’ is really too priceless! Just as though, ‘in the Ninth,’ he said ‘we need only have the finale,’ or ‘just the overture’ of the Meistersinger.’
‘只有行板！你怎么继续下去，”他的妻子喊道。 “好像不只是‘行板’折断了我身体里的每一根骨头。” ‘师尊’实在是太无价了！就好像，“在第九交响曲中，”他说，“我们只需要结局”，或者“只是名歌手的序曲”。

The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states—but from his habit, common to many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important, the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor.
然而，医生敦促女士。维尔迪兰让钢琴家演奏，并不是因为当她谈到音乐总是对她产生的痛苦影响时，他认为她在装病，因为他认识到某些神经衰弱状态的存在——而是因为他的习惯，这是许多医生的共同习惯，一旦它似乎危及对他来说更重要的事情，他就立即放松了严格的处方信，他参加了一些社交聚会的成功，而他曾经敦促病人忘记这一点她的消化不良或头痛是一个重要因素。

‘You won’t be ill this time, you’ll find,’ he told her, seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. ‘And, if you are ill, we will cure you.’
“你会发现，这次你不会生病了，”他告诉她，同时试图用他目光的磁性来征服她的思想。 “而且，如果你病了，我们会治愈你。”

‘Will you, really?’ Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all only a ‘little scene,’ and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an invalid’s point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon their feet.
“你真的愿意吗？”维尔迪兰说话的语气就好像她受到了如此大的恩惠，除了投降之外别无他法。或许，由于说自己要生病了，她也让自己陷入了一种状态，有时她会忘记这一切都只是一个“小场景”，并非常真诚地从一个角度看待事情。无效的观点。因为人们常常会说，病人厌倦了他们的攻击频率总是取决于他们自己避免攻击的谨慎性，并且喜欢让自己认为他们可以自由地做他们最喜欢做的一切，尽管他们总是这样做之后，只要他们把自己交给一个更高的权威，这个权威在不给他们带来任何不便的情况下，可以而且愿意，通过说一句话或发布一份小报，让他们重新站起来。

Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying to Mme. Verdurin, ‘I have my own little corner, haven’t I?’
奥黛特走到钢琴旁一张铺着挂毯的沙发上坐下，对夫人说道。维尔迪兰：“我有自己的小角落，不是吗？”

And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up. ‘You’re not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can make room for M. Swann there, can’t you, Odette?’
还有女士。维尔迪兰看到斯万独自坐在椅子上，便让他站起来。 ‘你在那里一点也不舒服；走过去，坐在奥黛特身边；你可以在那里给斯万先生腾出地方，不是吗，奥黛特？

‘What charming Beauvais!’ said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.
“多么迷人的博韦啊！”斯万说道，在坐下之前停下来欣赏沙发，并希望保持礼貌。

‘I am glad you appreciate my sofa,’ replied Mme. Verdurin, ‘and I warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them;—I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn’t it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design! Doesn’t it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn’t run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn’t it an exquisite surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!’
“我很高兴你喜欢我的沙发，”夫人回答道。维尔迪兰，“我警告你，如果你希望看到另一个类似的东西，你最好立即放弃这个想法。他们再也没有做过类似的事情。这些小椅子也是完美的奇迹。您稍后可以查看它们。每个青铜饰条上的标志都与椅子上挂毯的主题相对应；你知道，当你看着它们时，你将娱乐与指导结合在一起；——我向你保证，我可以保证你度过一段愉快的时光。只要看看边缘周围的小边框即可；在这里，看，红色背景上的小藤蔓，熊和葡萄。是不是画得很好呢？你怎么说？我认为他们对设计略知一二！这棵藤蔓，是不是让你流口水了？我丈夫认为我不喜欢吃水果，因为我吃的比他少。但不是一点点，我比你们谁都贪婪，但是当我能用眼睛吃它们的时候，我就不需要把它们塞满嘴了。请问你们现在在笑什么？询问医生；他会告诉你那些葡萄对我的作用就像定期的净化一样。有些人去枫丹白露求医；有些人去枫丹白露求医；我在这里服用我自己的博韦小药方。但是，斯旺先生，在没有摸到背面的小青铜饰条之前，你一定不能逃跑。是不是很精致的表面呢？不，不，不能那样用你的整只手；感受它们的财产！

‘If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,’ said the painter, ‘we shan’t get any music to-night.’
“如果女士。维尔迪兰要开始摆弄她的青铜器了，”画家说，“今晚我们不会听到任何音乐。”

‘Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,’ she went on, ‘are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don’t say that you never have been jealous!’
‘安静点，你这个坏蛋！然而我们这些可怜的女人，”她继续说道，“却是被禁止的快乐，远没有这般令人享受。世界上没有比这些更柔软的肉了。没有任何。当维尔迪兰先生让我有幸感到疯狂嫉妒时……来吧，你至少应该有礼貌。别说你从来没有嫉妒过！

‘But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call you as a witness; did I utter a word?’
“但是，亲爱的，我什么也没说。听着，医生，我请你作证人；我有说过一句话吗？

Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not like to stop.
出于礼貌，斯旺开始用手指抚摸那些青铜器，并且不愿意停下来。

‘Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be caressed, caressed in the ear; you’ll like that, I think. Here’s the young gentleman who will take charge of that.’
'一起来;你可以稍后再抚摸它们；现在要被爱抚的是你，在耳边被爱抚；我想你会喜欢的。这位年轻的绅士将负责此事。

After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:
钢琴家演奏后，斯旺对他比对其他客人更感兴趣，原因如下：

The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony—he knew not which—that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breath or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;—if our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and strange desire.
前一年，在一次晚会上，他听到一首钢琴和小提琴演奏的音乐。起初，他只欣赏这些乐器发出的声音的物质品质。当他突然察觉到，在小提琴部件的狭窄丝带之下，精致、不屈、坚固、支配着整个乐器，它试图在流动的声音浪潮中向上涌动时，这是一种强烈的快乐的源泉，钢琴声部的整体，形式多样，连贯，水平，旋律中到处都是断裂的，就像深蓝色的大海的骚动，在月光的照射下变成了银色的小调。但在某个特定的时刻，由于无法辨别出任何清晰的轮廓，也无法给令他高兴的东西命名，他突然欣喜若狂，试图收集、珍藏在记忆中的短语或和谐——他不知道是哪一个——刚刚演奏的那首曲子，打开了他的灵魂，扩展了他的灵魂，就像某些玫瑰的香味，在夜晚潮湿的空气中飘荡，具有扩张我们鼻孔的力量。也许正是由于他自己对音乐的无知，他才能够收到如此混乱的印象，尽管如此，其中之一是我们唯一的纯粹音乐印象，其范围有限，完全原创，并且不能还原为任何其他类型。 。这种秩序的印象，在瞬间消失，可以说是一种正弦印象。想必我们在这种时刻听到的音符往往会在我们眼前展开，根据音调和音量在更大或更小的表面上传播。追踪阿拉伯式花纹设计，给我们呼吸或纤细、稳定或任性的感觉。 但在这些感觉发展到足以逃脱淹没在随后的、甚至同时发生的音符已经开始唤醒我们的感觉之下之前，音符本身就已经消失了。这种不确定的感知将继续在其熔化的流动性中窒息那些时不时出现的、几乎难以辨别的主题，然后再次陷入、消失和淹没；只能通过他们灌输的特殊快乐来识别，无法描述，回忆，命名；难以言喻；——如果我们的记忆，就像一个在波涛汹涌的波浪下辛勤打下坚实基础的劳动者，没有通过为我们塑造那些转瞬即逝的短语的复制品，使我们能够将它们与那些难以描述的短语进行比较和对比。跟随。因此，斯万经历过的美妙感觉刚刚消失，他的记忆就立即为他提供了一份记录，总结，这是真的，而且是临时的，但他在演奏时一直盯着它。继续，如此有效，以至于当同样的印象突然出现时，它不再是无法捕捉的。他能够自己想象它的范围、它的对称排列、它的符号、它的表达的强度；他面前有一个明确的目标，它不再是纯粹的音乐，而是设计、建筑、思想，并允许人们回忆起真正的音乐。这次他非常清楚地辨别出了从声波中出现了一会儿的短语。它立即向他发出了分享亲密快乐的邀请，在听到它之前，他从未梦想过这种快乐的存在，他觉得除了这句话之外没有什么可以让他开始；他对它充满了热爱，就像一种新奇的渴望。

With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere, towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her name.
它以一种缓慢而有节奏的动作，带领他这里、那里、无处不在，走向一种高贵、难以理解、但却清晰可见的幸福状态。然后，突然到达了他准备跟随它的某个点，停顿了一会儿之后，它突然改变了方向，以一种新的运动，更加迅速，形式多样，忧郁，不断，甜蜜，它带着他带着它走向未知的欢乐景象。然后它就消失了。他怀着强烈的渴望，希望能够再次找到它，第三次。它确实重新出现了，虽然没有更清楚地对他说话，但确实给他带来了一种不那么深刻的快乐。但当他再次回到家时，他需要它，他就像一个男人，他短暂地看到一个女人进入他的生活，给他带来了一种新形式的美，这增强和扩大了他自己的感知能力，他甚至不知道是否还能再见到他已经爱着的她，尽管他对她一无所知，甚至不知道她的名字。

Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann’s life the possibility of a sort of re— juvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter’s birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one’s interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead—and better late than never—a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it.
事实上，在最初的几个月里，这种对音乐片段的热情似乎给斯旺的生活带来了某种复兴的可能性。他早已不再将自己的道路引向任何理想的目标，而是将自己局限于追求短暂的满足，以至于他开始相信，尽管甚至没有正式向自己表明他的信念，他仍然会保持自己的全部。在这种情况下的生活，只有死亡才能改变。不仅如此，由于他的心中不再有任何崇高的理想，他不再相信（尽管他不能明确否认）它们的现实。他还养成了逃避琐事的习惯，这使他能够把最重要的事情放在一边。正如他从未停下来问自己，如果不走进社会，他是否会做得更好，他很清楚，如果他接受了邀请，他就必须露面，而之后，如果他没有真正打电话，他至少得给女主人留下名片；因此，在谈话中，他小心翼翼地从不热情地表达对某件事的个人看法，而是提供本身具有某种价值的事实和细节，并原谅他没有表明他真正知道多少。他对菜肴的配方、画家的出生和死亡日期以及他的作品的标题都非常精确。有时，他会不由自主地对一件艺术作品或某人对生活的解释提出批评，但随后他会用讽刺的语气掩盖自己的话，就好像他确实不完全同意他所说的话。 但现在，就像一个确诊的病人一样，突然之间，空气和环境的变化，或者新的治疗过程，或者有时会发生的，他自己的有机变化，自发的和不负责任的，似乎已经康复了从他的疾病中，他开始设想一种可能性，迄今为止，这是不可能的，开始过一种完全不同的生活——迟到总比不好——斯旺在自己身上发现，在他听到的那句话的记忆中，在某些方面他让人们给他演奏其他奏鸣曲，看看他是否可能在其中发现他的乐句，那些看不见的现实之一的存在，他不再相信这些现实，但对它来说，仿佛音乐对他所遭受的道德贫瘠产生了一种创造性的影响，他再次意识到了一种渴望，几乎确实是一种奉献自己生命的力量。但是，他一直没能查出那天晚上听到的是谁的作品，也无法买到一份副本，最终忘记了这个任务。在接下来的几天里，他确实遇到了几个和他一起参加聚会的人，并向他们询问过；但他们中的大多数人要么在乐曲演奏之后到达，要么在乐曲演奏之前离开；有些人确实在屋子里，但去了另一个房间说话，留下来听的人并不比其他人有更清晰的印象。至于他的主人，他们知道这是一首最近出版的作品，他们晚上聘请的音乐家要求允许演奏这首作品；但是，由于最后这些现在正在某个地方巡回演出，斯旺无法了解更多信息。 当然，他有很多音乐朋友，但是，他清楚地记得这短短的乐句给他带来的精致而难以言喻的快乐，并且仍然可以在他眼前看到它所描绘的轮廓，他根本无法在空中对着他们哼哼。于是，他终于不再去想这件事了。

But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin’s, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend’s drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann’s features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil’s sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret.
但今晚，在夫人那里。维尔迪兰的钢琴家刚刚开始演奏，突然间，在一个高音持续了两个小节之后，斯万看到它正在接近，从共鸣下面偷偷地走出来，共鸣被延长并伸展在它上面，就像一道帘子一样。声音，掩盖了它诞生的神秘——并认出了他所喜爱的、秘密的、低语的、清晰的、轻快而芬芳的短语。它本身是如此奇特，它具有如此个人化的魅力，这是任何其他东西都无法替代的，以至于斯万感觉自己好像在朋友的客厅里遇到了一个他曾经在家里见过并钦佩的女人。街上，我已经绝望地再也见不到她了。最后，这句话撤回了，消失了，在它飘荡的香气中辛勤地指着、指挥着，在斯旺的脸上留下了微笑的倒影。但现在，他终于可以问到那个不知名的人的名字了（并被告知这是万特伊钢琴和小提琴奏鸣曲的行板乐章），他把它安全地保管着，可以在家里再次拥有它，只要他愿意，就可以研究它的语言并获取它的秘密。

And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin.
因此，当钢琴家演奏完毕后，斯旺穿过房间，热情地向他表示感谢，这让夫人很高兴。韦尔迪兰。

‘Isn’t he charming?’ she asked Swann, ‘doesn’t he just understand it, his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there’s everything in it except the piano! I’m caught out every time I hear it; I think I’m listening to an orchestra. Though it’s better, really, than an orchestra, more complete.’
“他不是很迷人吗？”她问斯万，“他的奏鸣曲，这个小坏蛋，他难道不明白吗？您从未梦想过，可以用一架钢琴来表达这一切，对吗？老实说，除了钢琴之外，里面什么都有！每次我听到它，我都会被抓住；我想我正在听管弦乐队的演奏。虽然它实际上比管弦乐队更好，更完整。”

The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram: ‘You are most generous to me.’
年轻的钢琴家在回答时俯身在她身上，微笑着并在每个词下面强调，就像在写警句：“你对我是最慷慨的。”

And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, ‘Run and fetch him a glass of orangeade; it’s well earned!’ Swann began to tell Odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a little way off, called out, ‘Well! It looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you, Odette!’ she replied, ‘Yes, very nice,’ and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata;—what meaning the little phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know.
而女士。维尔迪兰对她的丈夫说：“跑去给他拿一杯橙水来；” “这是你应得的！”斯旺开始告诉奥黛特他是如何爱上这句话的。就在离他们不远的地方，女主人喊道：‘好啦！在我看来，好像有人在对你说好话，奥黛特！”她回答道，“是的，非常好。”他发现她的单纯令人愉快。然后他询问了一些关于这个Vinteuil的信息；他还做了什么，在他生命中的什么时期创作了这首奏鸣曲；——这个小乐句对他来说有什么意义，这是斯万最想知道的。

But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed, ‘I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don’t dare to confess that you don’t know Vinteuil’s sonata; you have no right not to know it!’—and the painter had gone on with, ‘Ah, yes, it’s a very fine bit of work, isn’t it? Not, of course, if you want something ‘obvious,’ something ‘popular,’ but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us artists.’), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply.
但这些自称钦佩这位音乐家的人中没有一个人（当斯旺说这首奏鸣曲真的很迷人时，维尔迪兰夫人惊呼道：“我完全相信！确实很迷人！但你不敢承认你不喜欢”） “你不知道凡特伊的奏鸣曲；你没有权利不知道它！”——画家继续说道，“啊，是的，这是一件非常好的作品，不是吗？当然不是，如果你愿意的话一些“显而易见”的东西，一些“流行”的东西，但是，我的意思是说，它给我们艺术家留下了非常深刻的印象。”），他们似乎都没有问过自己这些问题，因为他们都无法回答。

Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, ‘D’you know, that’s a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don’t much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don’t waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it’s not a habit of ours, that’s all,’ Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of ‘Master’ Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil’s sonata or in Biche’s portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people—real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman’s hair was not, ordinarily, purple.
即使是斯旺对他最喜欢的短语发表的一两句话，“你知道吗，这是一件有趣的事情；”我从来没有注意到这一点；我不妨告诉你，我不太关心通过显微镜观察事物，并在细微的差异上刺痛自己；不;我们不会在这所房子里浪费时间吹毛求疵；为什么不？好吧，这不是我们的习惯，仅此而已，”夫人。维尔迪兰回答道，而科塔德医生张大嘴巴，钦佩地看着她，渴望能够跟随她，看着她轻轻地从一个踏脚石跳到另一个现成的短语。然而，他和夫人。科塔尔具有许多出身卑微的人所共有的常识，他总是小心翼翼地不发表意见，或者假装欣赏一首音乐，一旦他们安全地到达了，他们就会互相承认。家，他们对比什“大师”的艺术的理解并不多。由于公众无法认识到艺术的魅力、美丽，甚至自然的轮廓，除非他们已经逐渐吸收了艺术的刻板印象，而原创艺术家则从拒绝这些印象开始，所以M.和Mme。在这方面，科塔尔是公众的典型，无论是在万特伊的奏鸣曲中还是在比什的肖像画中，他都无法找到对他们来说音乐或绘画之美的和谐是什么。在他们看来，当钢琴家演奏他的奏鸣曲时，他仿佛从钢琴上随意弹奏出与他们自己习惯的音乐形式毫无关系的混合音符，而画家只是随意地把颜色扔到了上面。他的画布。 当他们能够在其中一幅作品上辨别出人形时，他们总是发现它变得粗糙和庸俗（也就是说，缺乏绘画流派的所有优雅，他们自己习惯于通过其眼镜来看待人们） ——真实的、活生生的人，在街上经过他们），缺乏真相，好像比什先生不知道人类的肩膀是如何构造的，或者女人的头发通常不是紫色的。

And yet, when the ‘faithful’ were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme. Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil’s sonata) like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: ‘Yes, indeed; he’s what they call a musician di primo cartello!’ he exclaimed, with a sudden determination.
然而，当“信徒”们分散到听不到的地方时，博士觉得这个机会太好了，不容错过，因此（当维尔迪兰夫人最后对万特伊的奏鸣曲表示赞扬时）就像一个潜在的游泳者跳入水中学习，但选择了没有太多人观看的时刻：“是的，确实如此；”他就是人们所说的音乐家迪·普里莫·卡泰罗！”他突然下定决心，大声喊道。

Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil’s sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public.
斯万发现的只不过是最近出版的凡特伊奏鸣曲在最先进的音乐家流派中引起了巨大轰动，但它仍然不为公众所知。

‘I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,’ said Swann, thinking of the old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother’s sisters.
“我很熟悉一个人，名叫万特伊，”斯旺说道，他想起了贡布雷的一位老音乐大师，他曾经教过我祖母的姐妹们。

‘Perhaps that’s the man!’ cried Mme. Verdurin.
“也许就是那个男人！”夫人喊道。韦尔迪兰。

‘Oh, no!’ Swann burst out laughing. ‘If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn’t put the question.’
“哦，不！”斯旺大笑起来。 “如果你见过他一会儿，你就不会提出这个问题。”

‘Then to put the question is to solve the problem?’ the Doctor suggested.
“那么提出问题就是解决问题吗？”博士建议道。

‘But it may well be some relative,’ Swann went on. ‘That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn’t have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there’s no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn’t undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool’s company, which would be ghastly.’
“但很可能是某个亲戚，”斯旺继续说道。 ‘那就够糟糕了；但毕竟，天才没有理由不拥有一个愚蠢的老傻瓜的表弟。如果真是这样，我发誓，为了让这个老傻瓜把我介绍给创作这首奏鸣曲的人，我不会经历任何已知或未知的折磨；首先是对老傻瓜公司的折磨，这将是可怕的。

The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and that Dr. Potain despaired of his life.
画家明白万特伊此刻病得很重，波坦医生对他的生活感到绝望。

‘What!’ cried Mme. Verdurin, ‘Do people still call in Potain?’
“什么！”夫人叫道。维尔迪兰：“人们还在波坦打电话吗？”

‘Ah! Mme. Verdurin,’ Cottard simpered, ‘you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues—I should say, one of my masters.’
'啊！女士。维尔迪兰，”科塔尔笑着说，“你忘了你说的是我的一位同事——我应该说，我的一位老师。”

The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of these.
画家在某处听说凡特伊受到失去理智的威胁。他坚持认为，在奏鸣曲的某些段落中可以发现这种迹象。斯万并不觉得这句话可笑；相反，他认为这句话很荒谬。相反，这让他感到困惑。因为，由于一部纯粹的音乐作品不包含任何逻辑顺序，而这些逻辑顺序的中断或混乱，无论是口头还是书面语言，都是精神错乱的证明，所以在奏鸣曲中诊断出的精神错乱对他来说就像是一个神秘的事情，就像在奏鸣曲中诊断出精神错乱一样神秘。狗或马，尽管可以观察到这些例子。

‘Don’t speak to me about ‘your masters’; you know ten times as much as he does!’ Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. ‘Anyhow, you don’t kill your patients!’
“别跟我说‘你的主人’；你知道的东西比他多十倍！’女士。维尔迪兰以一位有勇气坚持自己的信念并随时准备与任何不同意她的人对抗的女性的语气回答了科塔尔博士。 “无论如何，你不能杀死你的病人！”

‘But, Madame, he is in the Academy.’ The Doctor smiled with bitter irony. ‘If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, ‘Yes, I have Potain.’’
“但是，夫人，他在学院里。”博士讽刺地笑了笑。 “如果一个病人宁愿死在科学王子之一的手中……能够说‘是的，我有波坦’要明智得多。”

‘Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?’ said Mme. Verdurin. ‘So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn’t know that.... Oh, you do make me laugh!’ she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands. ‘And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing that you were pulling my leg.’
‘噢，确实如此！更聪明了，是吗？”夫人说。韦尔迪兰。 “所以现在疾病也有时尚，不是吗？我不知道……哦，你真让我笑了！”她突然尖叫起来，把脸埋在手里。 “而我，可怜的东西，却很认真地说话，却没有发现你在开我的玩笑。”

As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth.
至于维尔迪兰先生，他觉得为这么一件小事再次开怀大笑实在是太费力了，他满足于从烟斗里喷出一团烟雾，同时他悲伤地反思，他再也不能希望跟上他的步伐了。妻子在她的亚特兰大航班上穿越欢乐的田野。

‘D’you know; we like your friend so very much,’ said Mme. Verdurin, later, when Odette was bidding her good night. ‘He is so unaffected, quite charming. If they’re all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by all means bring them.’
‘你知道吗？我们非常喜欢你的朋友，”女士说。后来，当奥黛特向维尔迪兰道晚安时。 ‘他是如此的不受影响，非常有魅力。如果他们都是这样的话，你想带来这里的朋友一定要带他们来。

M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate the pianist’s aunt.
维尔迪兰先生评论说，斯旺仍然未能欣赏这位钢琴家的姨妈。

‘I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,’ suggested Mme. Verdurin. ‘You can’t expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little ‘clan’ now for years. The first time doesn’t count; it’s just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he’s to join us to-morrow at the Châtelet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him.’ ‘No, he doesn’t want that.’
“我敢说他感觉有点奇怪，可怜的人，”夫人建议道。韦尔迪兰。 “你不能指望他第一次来就能够听懂这所房子的基调；就像科塔尔一样，他多年来一直是我们这个小“家族”的一员。第一次不算；只是为了环顾四周并找出东西。奥黛特，他明白了，他明天就要到夏特莱来和我们会合。 “不，他不想这样。”

‘Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn’t fail us at the last moment.’
'哦，很好;就如你所愿。前提是他没有在最后一刻让我们失望。”

Greatly to Mme. Verdurin’s surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta’s funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: ‘I’ll see to that, all right. You shall have it in time for the Danicheff revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elysée.’
非常感谢女士。令维尔迪兰惊讶的是，他从来没有让他们失望过。他会去见他们，无论在哪里，在巴黎郊外的餐馆（并不是说他们一开始经常去那里，因为季节还没有开始），而且更频繁的是在戏剧中，Mme.维尔迪兰很高兴。一天晚上，当他们在家吃饭时，他听到她抱怨说她没有这些许可证，这样她就可以省去在门口等候和站在人群中的麻烦，并说这对他们在第一晚有多么有用。以及歌剧院的盛大演出，甘贝塔葬礼当天却没有演出，真是一件令人烦恼的事情。斯旺从不谈论他的杰出朋友，而只谈论那些可能被认为有害的朋友，因此，他认为隐瞒这些朋友是势利的，而且不太有品味。当他经常光顾圣日耳曼郊区时，他已经将第三共和国官方世界中的所有朋友都纳入了后者，因此不假思索地闯入：“我会处理的，好吧。”你会在丹尼切夫复兴时及时得到它。明天我将在爱丽舍宫与警察局长共进午餐。

‘What’s that? The Elysée?’ Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder.
'那是什么？爱丽舍宫？”科塔尔博士雷霆般地吼道。

‘Yes, at M. Grévy’s,’ replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced.
“是的，在格雷维先生家。”斯万回答道，他对自己的声明所产生的效果感到有点尴尬。

‘Are you often taken like that?’ the painter asked Cottard, with mock-seriousness.
“你经常被这样对待吗？”画家假装严肃地问科塔尔。

As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: ‘Ah, good, good; that’s all right, then,’ after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion. But this time Swann’s last words, instead of the usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State.
通常，一旦给出解释，科塔尔就会说：“啊，好，好；”那就好吧。”说完，他就没有表现出丝毫的情绪。但这一次，斯旺的最后一句话没有像往常那样起到镇静作用，而是立即变得激动起来，他惊讶地发现，实际上和他一起坐在桌旁的是一个没有任何正式职位的人。 ，没有任何形式的荣誉或荣誉，与国家元首保持着访问关系。

‘What’s that you say? M. Grévy? Do you know M. Grévy?’ he demanded of Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the newspapers say, ‘it is a case of,’ he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary.
‘你说什么？格雷维先生？ “你认识格雷维先生吗？”当一个陌生人走过来要求见共和国总统时，他用宫殿里值班警察的愚蠢和难以置信的语气向斯旺问道；直到，正如报纸上所说的，他从他的言语和态度中猜测出“这是一个案件”，他向这个可怜的疯子保证他将立即入院，并指出了通往警察医务室接待病房的路。

‘I know him slightly; we have some friends in common’ (Swann dared not add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). ‘Anyhow, he is very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not the least bit amusing; they’re very simple affairs, too, you know; never more than eight at table,’ he went on, trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor’s eyes.
“我对他有一点了解；我们有一些共同的朋友”（斯旺不敢补充其中一位朋友是威尔士亲王）。 “不管怎样，他对邀请非常随意，而且，我向你保证，他的午餐会一点也不有趣；你知道，它们也是非常简单的事情；餐桌上的人永远不会超过八人。”他继续说道，拼命地试图删掉一切似乎表明他与总统关系的东西，这些东西对于博士的眼睛来说太耀眼了。

Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Grévy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was ‘always at the Elysée’; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore.
科塔尔立即在心里接受了斯旺所说的话的字面解释，认为格雷维先生的邀请很少受到欢迎，事实上，它们被发送到了高速公路和树篱上。从那一刻起，当他听到斯旺或其他任何人“总是在爱丽舍宫”时，他似乎一点也不感到惊讶。他甚至为一个不得不参加午餐会的人感到有点遗憾，他自己也承认，午餐会很无聊。

‘Ah, good, good; that’s quite all right then,’ he said, in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage.
‘啊，好，好；那就没什么问题了，”他用迄今为止一直持怀疑态度的海关官员的语气说道，但在听完你的解释后，他在你的护照上盖了章，让你继续旅程，而不必费心检查你的行李。

‘I can well believe you don’t find them amusing, those parties; indeed, it’s very good of you to go to them!’ said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the President of the Republic only as a ‘bore’ to be especially dreaded, since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which, if employed to captivate her ‘faithful,’ might easily make them ‘fail.’ ‘It seems, he’s as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.’
“我完全相信你不会觉得这些聚会很有趣；确实，你能去拜访他们真是太好了！”维尔迪兰认为共和国总统只是一个特别令人畏惧的“讨厌鬼”，因为他拥有诱惑手段，甚至强迫手段，如果用来迷惑她的“忠诚”，很容易使他们“失败了。”“看来，他聋得像个柱子一样；”并用手指吃饭。

‘Upon my word! Then it can’t be much fun for you, going there.’ A note of pity sounded in the Doctor’s voice; and then struck by the number—only eight at table—‘Are these luncheons what you would describe as ‘intimate’?’ he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal.
‘我保证！ “那么去那里对你来说就没有什么乐趣了。”博士的声音里带着一丝怜悯。然后他被这个数字震惊了——餐桌上只有八个人——“这些午餐是你所说的‘亲密’吗？”他轻快地问道，与其说是出于无聊的好奇心，不如说是出于他的语言热情。

But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking anxiously, ‘D’you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a personal friend of M. Grévy’s. I suppose that means he’s what you’d call a ‘gentleman’?’ He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition.
但在科塔尔博士眼中，法兰西共和国总统是如此伟大和光荣，以至于斯万的谦虚和夫人的恶意都没有。维尔迪兰永远无法完全消除这种第一印象，每次与维尔迪兰一家共进晚餐时，他都会焦急地问：“你认为今晚我们会在这里见到斯万先生吗？”他是格雷维先生的私人朋友。我想这意味着他就是你所说的‘绅士’？”他甚至还给斯旺一张牙科展览会的邀请卡。

‘This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,’ he explained, ‘but dogs are not admitted. I’m just warning you, you understand, because some friends of mine went there once, who hadn’t been told, and there was the devil to pay.’
他解释说：“这可以让你和你随身携带的任何人进去，但狗不允许进入。”我只是警告你，你明白，因为我的一些朋友去过那里一次，但没有被告知，而且要付出惨重的代价。

As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken.
至于维尔迪兰先生，他也注意到，斯万有一些颇有影响力的朋友，但他从未提及过这些朋友，这给他的妻子带来了痛苦的影响。

If no arrangement had been made to ‘go anywhere,’ it was at the Verdurins’ that Swann would find the ‘little nucleus’ assembled, but he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette’s entreaties.
如果没有安排“去任何地方”，斯万就会在维尔迪兰家发现“小核心”聚集在一起，但除了晚上他从来不会出现在那里，而且几乎不会接受他们的晚餐邀请。尽管奥黛特一再恳求。

‘I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you’d rather,’ she suggested.
“如果你愿意的话，我可以和你单独在某个地方吃饭，”她建议道。

‘But what about Mme. Verdurin?’
“但是夫人呢？”维尔迪兰？

‘Oh, that’s quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.’
‘哦，这很简单。我只需说我的衣服还没准备好，或者我的出租车来晚了。总有一些借口。

‘How charming of you.’
“你真迷人。”

But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette’s style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins’. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; Rémi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins’. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: ‘I am furious with you!’ and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them—for their two selves, and for no one else—that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and—just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door—infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light—as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come—than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself—which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some ‘professional’ to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. ‘Why do you want the rest?’ she had asked him. ‘Our little bit; that’s all we need.’ He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the ‘water’ of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a ‘lass unparalleled.’
但斯万对自己说，如果他能让奥黛特感觉到（通过同意只在晚饭后见到她）他更喜欢其他的快乐而不是她的陪伴，那么她对他的渴望就会更加长久。达到饱足感的程度。此外，由于他极其喜欢奥黛特那种小职业女孩的美貌，像玫瑰一样清新丰润，而他又恰巧同时爱上了她，所以他更愿意和她一起度过傍晚的第一部分，因为他知道他确信稍后会见到奥黛特。出于同样的原因，他永远不会允许奥黛特去他家叫他，带他去维尔迪兰家。小女孩常常在离他家门不远的街角等他。他的车夫雷米知道该停在哪里。她会跳到他身边，把他抱在怀里，直到马车停在维尔迪兰家。他会走进客厅；在那里，而夫人。维尔迪兰指着那天早上送给她的玫瑰花说：“我对你很生气！”然后把他送到为他保留的地方，在奥黛特旁边，钢琴家会为他们两个演奏。只为自己，不为任何人——万特伊的这句小词可以说是他们爱情的国歌。他总是以小提琴部分的持续颤音开始，其中有几个小节没有伴奏，并充满了整个前景。直到突然之间，它似乎被拉到一边，而且——就像彼得·德·霍赫（Pieter de Hooch）的那些室内设计一样，主题在半开的门的狭窄框架中退后很远——无限遥远，颜色截然不同，柔软伴随着一些介入光的光芒，这个小短语出现了，舞蹈，田园，插入，情节，属于另一个世界。 它以简单而不朽的动作走过，将其恩典的恩惠撒向四面八方，仍然微笑着，难以言表；但斯万认为他现在可以从中看出一些失望。它似乎意识到自己所引领的幸福是多么虚荣、多么空虚。在它空灵的优雅中，确实有某种明确的成就，并且本身是完整的，就像在徒劳的遗憾爆发后产生的哲学超然情绪。但这对他来说并不重要。他不太从奏鸣曲本身的角度来看待它——因为它可能表达的内容，实际上是向某个音乐家表达的，不知道任何斯旺或奥黛特，在世界任何地方，当他创作它时，都存在，并且会表达对于所有在未来几个世纪里应该听到这首曲子的人来说，而不是作为一种誓言，一种他的爱的象征，这甚至使维尔迪兰夫妇和他们的小钢琴家想到了奥黛特，同时也想到了他自己——这将她束缚在他有一条持久的领带；那时，他（奥黛特异想天开地恳求）放弃了让一些“专业人士”为他演奏整首奏鸣曲的想法，而他对奏鸣曲的了解除了这一段之外。 “你为什么想要剩下的？”她问他。 ‘我们的一点点；这就是我们所需要的。’他走得更远；当它从他身边经过的那一刻，他对倒影感到痛苦，如此接近，却又如此无限遥远，虽然它是对着他们的耳朵说的，但它不认识他们，他几乎会后悔，它有它的意义一种内在的、不可改变的美，对它们来说是陌生的，就像在送给我们的珠宝中，甚至在我们所爱的女人写给我们的信中，我们对石头的“水”挑剔，或用一句话来形容，因为它们并非完全是由转瞬即逝的亲密关系和“无与伦比的少女”的精神构成的。’

It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins’ that, as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La Pérouse, behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with her at the Verdurins’, to the exercise of this other privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for the night.
常常会发生这样的情况：在去维尔迪兰家之前，他和他的小女儿在外面呆了很长时间，钢琴家一演奏出这首小乐句，斯旺就会发现它几乎已经是奥黛特该回家了。他常常把她带回她位于凯旋门后面的拉佩鲁斯街的小房子门口。也许正是因为这个原因，为了不要求独占她的恩惠，他牺牲了晚上早些时候见到她、和她一起到达韦尔迪兰的快乐（这对他的幸福来说并不是那么重要）。 ”，行使他们一起离开的另一项特权，她对此表示感激；他更加珍惜这种特权，因为有了它，他有一种感觉，在他离开之后，没有人会看到她，没有人会把自己插在他们中间，没有人可以阻止他在精神上与她在一起。她过夜。

And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann’s carriage; and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and murmured ‘Till to-morrow, then!’ she turned impulsively from him, plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk.
就这样，夜复一夜，她都会被斯万的马车带回家。一天晚上，当她下楼后，当他站在门口低声说：“那么，明天吧！”她冲动地转身离开他，在街边小花园里摘下最后一朵残存的菊花。回到她家，当他回到马车上时，把它塞到了手里。在开车回家的路上，他把它贴在嘴唇上，当这朵花在适当的时候枯萎时，他把它锁起来，像一件非常珍贵的东西一样，锁在他办公桌的秘密抽屉里。

He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony—of such vital importance in her life —of ‘afternoon tea.’ The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside.
他会护送她到门口，但不会更远。他只进屋参加过两次“下午茶”仪式——这在她的生命中至关重要。那些短街的孤独和空虚（几乎全部都是低矮的屋顶房屋，但并不超然，他们的单调被一些邪恶的小商店的黑暗入侵所打断，这家商店既是一份历史文件，又是该地区声名狼藉的日子里留下的肮脏的遗物），地上的雪花园里的花坛或紧贴在树枝上，季节的粗心混乱，在这座人造城市中对自然状态的主张，所有这些结合在一起，为温暖、花朵增添了神秘的元素。 ，他在里面发现的奢华。

Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette’s bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been ‘the rage’ in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, ‘You’re not comfortable there; wait a minute, I’ll arrange things for you,’ and with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human—filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight—she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man’s clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over—and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something ‘quaint’ in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. ‘It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,’ she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so ‘smart’ a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them ‘darlings.’ And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann’s tea, inquired ‘Lemon or cream?’ and, on his answering ‘Cream, please,’ went on, smiling, ‘A cloud!’ And as he pronounced it excellent, ‘You see, I know just how you like it.’ This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o’clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon’s adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: ‘What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea.’ An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. ‘Why,’ she wrote, ‘did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.’
他经过奥黛特的卧室（在他的左手边，虽然离街道高出一些距离，但那是房子的底层），从卧室望出去，可以看到另一条与她自己的卧室平行的小街。她爬上了一段楼梯，楼梯在深色油漆的墙壁之间笔直向上，墙壁上挂着东方窗帘、一串串土耳其珠子和一盏巨大的日本灯笼，用一根丝绳从天花板上悬挂下来（不过，丝绳的寿命很长，这样她的访客就不会被打扰）不得不抱怨缺乏西方文明的最新舒适设施（由里面的煤气灯照明），到两个大大小小的客厅。这些是通过一个狭窄的大厅进入的，大厅的墙壁上有菱形的木格子，就像你在花园的墙上看到的那样，只是镀金的，从一端到另一端排列着一个长方形的盒子，里面盛开着花朵，仿佛在一座温室，一排巨大的菊花，在当时仍然不常见，尽管绝不像园艺家后来成功种植的猛犸花那么大。斯万通常会因为看到这些花而感到恼火，当时这些花在巴黎“风靡一时”了大约一年，但这一次，他很高兴看到小大厅的阴暗这些转瞬即逝的星星的芬芳花瓣发出粉色、金色和白色的光芒，在冬日午后的阴暗气氛中点燃了寒冷的火焰。奥黛特穿着一件粉色丝绸茶袍接待了他，脖子和手臂都裸露在外。 她让他坐在她旁边，在房间的各个角落里设计了许多神秘的小隐居处之一，这些隐居处有从中国瓷盆里长出来的巨大棕榈树，或者是上面贴着照片和扇子的屏风。和丝带蝴蝶结。她立刻说道：“你在那里不舒服；”等一下，我给你安排一下。”她在他的头后面和脚下安上了巨大的垫子，笑声中带着自满的笑声，这意味着她自己的一些小发明正在发挥作用。她用日本丝绸敲打着它，仿佛决心要把她所有的财富都挥霍在他身上，不管它们的价值如何。但当她的男仆开始走进房间时，一个接一个地带来了无数的灯（大部分装在瓷花瓶里），这些灯在不同的家具上单个或成对地燃烧，就像在许多祭坛上一样，在房间里重新点燃。这个冬天的午后，暮色已经几乎是夜间的了，夕阳的光芒更加持久，更加玫瑰色，更加人性化——也许，在某个孤独的恋人的思绪中充满了浪漫的奇迹，在下面的街道上徘徊，在前面停下来那些亮着灯的窗户既显露了人类存在的神秘性，又将其遮蔽了视线——她一直密切地盯着仆人，看他是否把每一盏灯都放在指定的地方。她觉得，如果他把其中一张放在不该放的地方，她客厅的整体效果就会被破坏，而她的肖像放在铺着毛绒的倾斜画架上，也不会引人注目。光。 于是，她带着狂热的不耐烦，跟着那个男人笨拙的动作，当他离一对花盆太近时，她严厉地斥责了他。现在去找他们，以确保他没有折断任何一朵花。她在每件中国装饰品的形状中都发现了一些“古朴”的东西，在她的兰花中，尤其是卡特兰（这些与菊花一起，是她最喜欢的花）中也发现了一些“古雅”的东西，因为它们具有看起来一点也不像的最高优点。其他花，但显然是用丝绸或缎子的碎片制成的。 “它看起来就像是从我斗篷的衬里上剪下来的，”她指着一朵兰花对斯旺说，她的声音里带着一丝敬意，对如此“聪明”的一朵花，对这种杰出的、意想不到的花。大自然突然赐予她的姐姐，在存在的尺度上与她相去甚远，但她却如此精致，如此精致，比许多真正进入她客厅的女人更有价值。当她吸引他的注意力时，时而注意画在碗上或缝在火屏上的火舌龙，时而注意一簇肉质的兰花，时而注意镶嵌银制、红宝石眼睛的单峰骆驼，它们一直陪伴着，她的壁炉架上刻着一只玉蟾蜍，她时而假装因怪物的凶猛而退缩，时而嘲笑它们的荒谬，时而因花朵的不雅而脸红，时而被一种不可抗拒的欲望所控制，想要跑过去，亲吻蟾蜍和单峰骆驼，称它们为“亲爱的”。这些矫揉造作与她的一些真诚态度形成了鲜明的对比，特别是她对拉格托圣母的忠诚，当奥黛特住在尼斯时，她曾经治愈了她的一种致命疾病，她的金质奖章，她始终继承着自己的人格，赋予其无限的力量。她倒了斯旺的茶，问“柠檬还是奶油？”当他回答“奶油，请”时，她微笑着继续说道，“一片云！”当他说得很好时，“你看，我知道你是怎么做的。”这种茶确实对斯万来说是一种珍贵的东西，就像对她来说一样，到目前为止，爱情必须为自己找到一些理由，一些保证其快乐持续的保证，相反，它会带来快乐。除了爱之外，没有任何存在，并且必须随着它的流逝而结束，当他在七点钟离开她，去穿好晚上的衣服，一路回家时，笔直地坐在他的马车里，无法抑制幸福的感觉下午的冒险让他充满了这种感觉，他不断地对自己重复道：“如果有一个这样的小女人，在一个人们总能确定找到的地方，那该多有趣啊，一个永远不能确定找到的东西，一个大约一个小时后，他收到了奥黛特的一张纸条，立刻认出了那张华丽的笔迹，其中英国人僵硬的做作在无形的字符上施加了明显的纪律，也许意义重大，但不太亲密。与他相比，他的眼睛不整洁，思想不整洁，教育不完整，缺乏真诚和决心。斯旺把他的烟盒留在了她家。 “为什么，”她写道，“你也没有忘记你的心吗？”我不应该让你拿回来。’

More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one’s ideal is always unattainable, and one’s actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve crêpe de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer’s pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro’s Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sixtine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman Rémi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving—though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music—had enriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette’s resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname, now that ‘Botticelli’ suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette’s face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness—as of carnation-petals—which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible.
也许更重要的是稍后他第二次拜访她。在回家的路上，就像往常一样，当他知道他们要见面时，他的脑海里浮现出了她的画面；如果他想在她的脸上发现任何美丽，他就必须将目光集中在她颧骨上新鲜而红润的突起上，而将那些经常疲倦和蜡黄的脸颊的其余部分排除在外，除非它们身上布满了小火点，让他陷入了严重的抑郁之中，证明一个人的理想总是遥不可及，一个人的实际幸福也平庸。他给她带了一幅她要求看的版画。她身体不太好。她接待了他，身上穿着一件淡紫色双绉裹布，披在她的胸前，像一件斗篷，上面绣着华丽的网。她站在他身边，用松散的发丝拂过他的脸颊，以几乎是舞者的姿势弯曲单膝，这样她就可以低着头凝视着照片，而不至于感到疲倦。斯万惊讶地发现，她那双大眼睛，在没有什么能让她生气的时候，显得那么疲倦、那么阴沉，她与西斯丁壁画中的杰思罗的女儿西坡拉的形象非常相似。 他总是对在古代大师的画作中发现一种独特的魅力，不仅是他在日常生活中遇到的人的一般特征，而且是那些似乎最不易概括的东西，即那些他所接触的男人和女人的个人特征。例如，他知道安东尼奥·里佐（Antonio Rizzo）创作的洛雷丹总督半身像，突出的颧骨，倾斜的眉毛，简而言之，与他自己的马车夫雷米（Rémi）说话相似；颜色是基尔兰达约的，鼻子是德·帕兰西先生的；在丁托列托的一幅肖像画中，胡须的露头侵入了丰满的脸颊，断掉的鼻子，锐利的目光，杜布尔邦医生肿胀的眼睑。也许是因为他内心一直后悔自己把注意力限制在生活的社会方面，总是只说而不是行动，他觉得他可能会找到那些伟大的艺术家给予他的某种放纵。 ，在他看来，他们也高兴地看待并承认这些类型的相貌成为他们作品的经典，从而为这些作品提供了最有力的现实和生活真实性的证明；一种现代的、几乎是时事的品味；也许，到目前为止，他已经屈服于时尚界盛行的轻浮，以至于他觉得有必要在一部古老的杰作中找到一些如此明显和令人耳目一新的暗示，来暗示一个可以开玩笑、重复和享受的人——天。 另一方面，也许他保留了足够的艺术气质，能够在观看这些个体特征呈现出更普遍的意义时找到真正的满足，当他看到它们被连根拔起和脱离实体时，在相似性的抽象概念中，一幅历史肖像和一幅现代原作，但它的目的并不是要代表谁。不管怎样，也许是因为过去一段时间以来，他收到了丰富的印象——尽管事实上，这些印象是通过他对音乐的欣赏的渠道来到他身边的——丰富了他对绘画的兴趣。好吧，斯万带着一种不同寻常的强烈的快乐，这种快乐注定会对他的性格和行为产生持久的影响，斯旺说奥黛特与亚历山德罗·德·马里亚诺的西坡拉相似，人们不敢说出他更受欢迎的姓氏，现在，“波提切利”所暗示的与其说是大师的实际作品，不如说是对它的错误而平庸的概念，这种概念最近已得到普遍流行。他不再根据她的脸颊或多或少的良好品质以及康乃馨花瓣般的柔软和甜美来评价奥黛特的脸的优点，他认为，如果他冒险的话，她的嘴唇会在那里迎接他。拥抱，而是将其视为一束微妙而可爱的丝线，他凝视的眼睛将丝线收集起来并缠绕在一起，沿着从丝线到球的弯曲线，在那里他将她脖子的节奏与她的弹簧混合在一起头发和下垂的眼睑，就像是她自己的肖像，她的类型清晰可辨。

He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words ‘Florentine painting’ were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural.
他站在那里凝视着她；旧壁画的痕迹在她的脸上和四肢上清晰可见，后来他不断地试图重新捕捉这些痕迹，无论是当他和奥黛特在一起时，还是当他只是在她不在的时候想起她时；尽管他对佛罗伦萨杰作的钦佩可能是基于他发现这幅杰作在她身上得到了复制，但这种相似性也增强了她的美丽，使她在他眼中更加珍贵。斯万责备自己迄今为止未能评估出伟大的桑德罗会崇拜的生物的真正价值，并认为自己很幸运，他在沉思奥黛特时的乐趣在他自己的审美体系中找到了合理性。他告诉自己，在选择奥黛特的思想作为他理想幸福梦想的灵感时，他并不像他之前所认为的那样，仅仅依靠一种值得怀疑且肯定不充分的价值的权宜之计，因为她包含了她本身就满足了他对艺术品味的最高要求。他没有注意到，这种品质自然不会有助于将奥黛特纳入他认为理想的女性类别，仅仅是因为他的欲望总是与他的审美品味背道而驰。 “佛罗伦萨绘画”这个词对斯旺来说是无价的。它们使他（可以说是给了他一个合法的头衔）将奥黛特的形象引入了一个充满梦想和幻想的世界，在此之前，她一直被禁止进入这个世界，在那里她呈现出一种新的、更高尚的形式。 虽然只要看到她的肉体，他就会不断地对她的脸庞、她的身材、她的整体美貌产生疑虑，从而冷却他的爱情热情，但那些疑虑一扫而光，爱也随之消失了。现在他确信，他可以在自己的美学原则的可靠基础上重新建立对她的评价；而这个吻，身体的臣服，看起来很自然，但也颇具吸引力，如果它们是由一个肉体有些枯萎、血液迟缓的生物赐予他的，就像现在一样，是为了给他对画廊里的一件杰作的崇拜加冕。看起来，它们一定是超自然的，也是精致的。

And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a collector.
当他很想后悔过去几个月来除了拜访奥黛特之外什么也没做时，他会向自己保证，他放弃大部分时间来研究一件不可估量的珍贵艺术作品，这并不是没有道理的。一次是在一种新的、一种不同的、一种特别迷人的金属中，在一个无与伦比的典范中，他有时会以艺术家的谦逊、精神、无私的头脑来思考它，有时又会以艺术家的骄傲、自私和感官刺激来思考它。集电极。

On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro’s Daughter. He would gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might, ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and blood, of Jethro’s Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette’s physical charms had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart.
在他工作的书桌上，他放了一张杰思罗女儿的复制品，就像一张奥黛特的照片。他会钦佩地凝视着她的大眼睛，从她精致的五官中可以看出她皮肤的缺陷，还有落在她疲惫的脸颊上的一绺奇妙的头发；他根据审美的理由，将他已经感觉到的美丽的事物改编成一个活着的女人的想法，并将其转化为一系列的身体优点，他庆幸自己发现这些优点最终集中在一个他可能的人身上。 , 拥有.既然观众已经了解了叶思罗女儿的温暖血肉类型，那么吸引观众观看艺术品的那种模糊的同情感，就变成了一种欲望，从那时起，这种欲望就足以补偿奥黛特的身体魅力所带来的一切。起初未能激发他的灵感。当他坐了很长时间凝视波提切利时，他会想起自己活着的波提切利，相比之下，波提切利显得更可爱，当他把西坡拉的照片拉向他时，他会想象他正把奥黛特靠在他的身上。心。

It was not only Odette’s indifference, however, that he must take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the manner—at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable—which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter: and he was right—by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the Maison Dorée—it was the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning ‘My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write——‘; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins’ she would come running up to him with an ‘I’ve something to say to you!’ and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart.
然而，他必须煞费苦心去规避的不仅是奥黛特的冷漠；还有他的冷漠。也常常是他自己的。感觉既然奥黛特已经很方便地见到他，当他们见面时，她似乎不再有太多话要对他说，他担心她现在的态度——既琐碎、单调，又似乎一成不变——他们在一起时采取的措施最终会摧毁他内心的那种浪漫的希望，即有一天她会公开表达她的激情，仅凭这一希望，他就成为了并将继续是她的情人。因此，为了改变，为了给奥黛特一个新的道德面貌，他担心奥杰特一成不变的情绪会变得厌倦，他突然写了一封信，里面充满了暗示的发现和假装的愤慨，他把这封信寄出去，以便它能够到达晚餐时间前的她。他知道她会害怕，她会回答，他希望，当失去他的恐惧抓住她的心时，她会说出他从未听过她说过的话：他是对的——通过重复这个策略，他从她那里赢得了迄今为止她写给他的最深情的信，其中一封（这是她在中午由多雷之家的一位特使寄给他的——那天是为穆尔西亚近期洪水灾民举办的巴黎穆尔西节日）开头是“亲爱的，我的手颤抖着，我几乎无法写——”；他把这些信和枯菊放在同一个抽屉里。否则，如果她没有时间写信，当他到达维尔迪兰家时，她会跑到他跟前说：“我有话要对你说！”而他会好奇地凝视着她脸上所透露的信息。以及她迄今为止一直向他隐瞒的心里话。

Even as he drew near to the Verdurins’ door, and caught sight of the great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the painter: ‘H’m. Seems to be getting warm.’ Indeed, her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart.
即使当他走近维尔迪兰家的门，看到客厅窗户上灯火通明的大空间，窗户的百叶窗从未关闭时，他就会开始融化在他将看到的迷人生物的想法中。当他走进房间时，沐浴在那金色的光芒中。客人们的身影时不时地在灯和窗户之间凸显出来，清晰而黑色，遮住了光线，就像人们有时看到的那些贴在玻璃屏风上的小图画，而其他窗格只是透明的。他会试着认出奥黛特。然后，当他一进去，不假思索地，他的眼睛突然闪烁着幸福的光芒，维尔迪兰先生对画家说：“嗯。”看起来越来越暖和了。”事实上，她的出现给这座房子带来了他参观过的其他房子所不具备的东西：一种触觉，一种神经系统，它延伸到每个房间，不断地刺激他的神经系统。心。

And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely the ‘little clan,’ were transformed for Swann into a series of daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home.
因此，一个社会有机体，即“小家族”的简单而有规律的表现，对斯万来说，转化为与奥黛特的一系列日常接触，使他能够假装对见到她的前景漠不关心，甚至不愿见到她。去看她;他这样做并没有冒很大的风险，因为尽管他是在白天给她写信的，但晚上他一定会见到她并陪她回家。

But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other ‘little girl’ all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins’, he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions.
但有一天晚上，一想到不可避免的黑暗驱车，他就带着他的另一个“小女孩”一路来到了布瓦，以便尽可能推迟他出现在维尔迪兰家的时间。 ，他来得太晚了，奥黛特以为他不打算来，就已经离开了。斯旺看到房间里空无一人，突然感到一阵痛苦，心都揪紧了。他感到自己被剥夺了一种快乐，他感到浑身发抖，他第一次开始估计这种快乐的强度，迄今为止，他总是确信只要他愿意，就能找到它，这（就像我们所有的快乐一样） ）减少了，如果它没有完全让他看不到它的尺寸的话。

‘Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn’t here?’ M. Verdurin asked his wife. ‘I think we may say that he’s hooked.’
“当他发现她不在这里时，你注意到他的表情了吗？”维尔迪兰先生问他的妻子。 “我想我们可以说他已经上瘾了。”

‘The face he pulled?’ exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing.
“他拉的那张脸？”科塔德医生爆发了，他离开家一会儿去探望病人，刚刚回来接他的妻子，不知道他们在谈论谁。

‘D’you mean to say you didn’t meet him on the doorstep—the loveliest of Swanns?’
“你的意思是说你没有在门口遇见他——斯旺最可爱的人？”

‘No. M. Swann has been here?’
'不。斯旺先生来过这里吗？

‘Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated. In a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.’
‘就一会儿。我们看到斯旺非常激动。处于紧张状态。你看，奥黛特已经离开了。”

‘You mean to say that she has gone the ‘whole hog’ with him; that she has ‘burned her boats’?’ inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning of his phrases.
“你的意思是说她已经‘全力以赴’地跟他在一起了； “她已经‘毁了她的船’？”医生小心翼翼地问道，测试着他这句话的含义。

‘Why, of course not; there’s absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between you and me, I think she’s making a great mistake, and behaving like a silly little fool, which she is, incidentally.’
‘为什么，当然不是；里面什么也没有；事实上，在你我之间，我认为她犯了一个很大的错误，她的行为就像一个愚蠢的小傻瓜，顺便说一句，她确实是个傻瓜。

‘Come, come, come!’ said M. Verdurin, ‘How on earth do you know that there’s ‘nothing in it’? We haven’t been there to see, have we now?’
“来吧，来吧，来吧！”维尔迪兰先生说道，“你到底怎么知道里面‘什么也没有’？我们还没去过那里看看，是吗？

‘She would have told me,’ answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. ‘I may say that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can’t; she admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he’s always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn’t care for him in that way, she says; it’s an ideal love, ‘Platonic,’ you know; she’s afraid of rubbing the bloom off—oh, I don’t know half the things she says, how should I? And yet he’s exactly the sort of man she wants.’
“她会告诉我的，”夫人回答道。维尔迪兰带着尊严。 “我可以说她告诉了我一切。由于她目前没有其他人，我告诉她应该和他住在一起。她发现自己做不到；她承认，一开始她被他深深吸引。但他总是对她害羞，这让她对他害羞。此外，她并没有那样关心他，她说；这是一种理想的爱情，“柏拉图式”，你知道；她害怕把花朵擦掉——哦，她说的话我有一半都不知道，我该怎么办？但他正是她想要的那种男人。

‘I beg to differ from you,’ M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. ‘I am only half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he ‘poses.’’
“我不敢苟同你的观点，”维尔迪兰先生礼貌地打断道。 “我对这位先生只满意一半。我觉得他‘摆姿势’。”

Mme. Verdurin’s whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to ‘pose’ in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who ‘mattered more’ than herself.
女士。维尔迪兰全身僵硬，目光呆滞，仿佛突然变成了一尊雕像；通过这种装置，她可能不会听到那个难以言表的词的声音，这个词似乎暗示人们可以在她的房子里“摆姿势”，因此，世界上有人比她自己“更重要”。

‘Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don’t suppose it’s because our friend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to believe in her intelligence. I don’t know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil’s sonata. I am devoted to Odette, but really—to expound theories of aesthetic to her—the man must be a prize idiot.’
“不管怎样，如果没有什么，我想那不是因为我们的朋友相信她的美德。然而，你永远不知道；他似乎相信她的智慧。我不知道你是否听到那天晚上他给她讲授凡特伊奏鸣曲的方式。我对奥黛特很忠诚，但实际上——要向她阐述美学理论——这个男人一定是个白痴。

‘Look here, I won’t have you saying nasty things about Odette,’ broke in Mme. Verdurin in her ‘spoiled child’ manner. ‘She is charming.’
“听着，我不会让你说奥黛特的坏话，”夫人插话道。维尔迪兰以她“被宠坏的孩子”的方式。 “她很迷人。”

‘There’s no reason why she shouldn’t be charming; we are not saying anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect. After all,’ he turned to the painter, ‘does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can’t tell; she might be a great deal less charming if she were.’
“她没有理由不迷人；我们并不是说她有什么坏话，只是说她既不是美德也不是智慧的化身。毕竟，”他转向画家，“她是否有道德有那么重要吗？你无法分辨；如果她是的话，她可能就不那么迷人了。

On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins’ butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Prévost’s on her way home. Swann set off at once for Prévost’s, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Prévost’s in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins’ that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin’s. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Prévost’s, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even—but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting.
在楼梯平台上，斯旺遇到了维尔迪兰家的管家，他刚到的时候管家还在别的地方，奥黛特请管家告诉斯旺（但那是至少一小时前的事了）她可能会停下来。回家路上在 Prévost's 喝了一杯巧克力。斯旺立即出发前往普雷沃斯特的家，但每隔几码，他的马车就会被其他人或过马路的人拦住，这些令人厌恶的障碍，他很乐意用车轮碾碎，如果不是一个警察摸索着笔记本会让他耽误的时间甚至比行人实际通过的时间还要长。他疯狂地数着时间，每分钟都加几秒，以便非常确定他没有给自己时间太短，因此，可能夸大了他及时到达普雷沃斯特并找到他的机会。她还在那里。然后，在一个恍然大悟的时刻，就像一个发烧的人从睡梦中醒来，意识到梦境的荒谬，他的思想一直在其中徘徊，他自己和他们之间没有任何明确的区别，斯万突然意识到如何自从他在维尔迪兰家听说奥黛特离开后，他的脑海里就一直盘旋着一些与他本性格格不入的想法，他所遭受的心痛是多么新奇，但他现在才意识到，仿佛他刚刚醒来。什么！所有这些骚动只是因为他从现在到明天都见不到奥黛特，正如他一小时前驱车前往奥黛特夫人时所希望的那样。维尔迪兰的。 他也不得不承认，现在，当他坐在同一辆马车里驶向普雷沃斯特的时候，他不再是原来的那个人，甚至不再孤单——而是一个新的人格就在他身边，依附于他，融合在一起。对他来说，他可能无法从他身上解放自己，他可能不得不采取某种策略来智胜主人或疾病。然而，在这最后一刻，他感觉到另一个新鲜的个性与他自己的个性结合在一起，不知何故，生活似乎更有趣了。

It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Prévost’s (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette’s company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins’; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace.
他徒劳地向自己保证这次可能在普雷沃斯特的会面（等待的紧张感如此强烈，剥夺了中间的时刻，以至于他在他的脑海中找不到任何东西，没有一个想法，没有一个记忆，在他的内心深处，他的困扰毕竟，如果举行的话，精神可能会得到庇护和休息）可能会与他们所有的会议大体相同，并不重要。和其他每个晚上一样，一旦他和奥黛特在一起，一旦他开始偷偷地扫视她不断变化的面容，然后立即收回目光，以免她在其中读出最初的欲望象征，不再相信他的冷漠。 ，他甚至无法想起她，他会忙着寻找借口，以便不立即离开她，并在不背叛他的关心的情况下向自己保证，他会再次找到她，第二天晚上，在维尔迪兰家；借口，也就是说，这将使他能够暂时延长一天，并在某一天再续一次失望，一种折磨人的欺骗，这种欺骗总是伴随着这个他可能接近的女人的徒劳存在而降临到他身上，却始终不敢拥抱。

She was not at Prevost’s; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman Rémi (Rizzo’s Doge Loredan) for whom he presently—after a fruitless search—found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which Rémi would say to him: ‘Sir, the lady is there,’ or as one in which Rémi would say to him: ‘Sir, the lady was not in any of the cafés.’ And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening—a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her.
她不在普雷沃斯特家；她不在普雷沃斯特家。那么，他必须在林荫大道上的每一家餐馆里寻找她。为了节省时间，当他朝一个方向走时，他派了另一个方向的车夫雷米（里佐饰演的总督洛雷丹饰），经过一番寻找无果后，他发现自己正在马车接他的地方等着他。它没有出现，斯旺用即将到来的时刻的交替图片来引诱自己，就像雷米会对他说：“先生，那位女士在那里，”或者雷米会对他说：“先生，这位女士不在任何一家咖啡馆里。”因此，他看到自己在晚上结束时所面临的情况——一个统一的事物，但由于介入的事故而分裂，这要么会通过发现奥黛特来结束他的痛苦，要么会迫使他放弃那天晚上找到她的任何希望，接受在没有见到她的情况下回家的必要性。

The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not ‘Did you find the lady?’ but ‘Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short.’ Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if Rémi had at last found Odette in some café, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, ‘I have found the lady,’ he would have answered, ‘Oh, yes, of course; that’s what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,’ and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure.
马车夫回来了。但是，当他停在他对面时，斯万问的不是“你找到那位女士了吗？”而是“提醒我，明天再订购一些柴火”。也许他已经说服自己，如果雷米最终在某个咖啡馆里找到了奥黛特，而她还在等他，那么他的痛苦之夜就已经被这一切所抹杀，因为他意识到，一切已经开始了。在他的脑海里，这是一个欢乐的夜晚，他没有必要急于获得已经捕获并保存在安全地方的幸福，这种幸福不会再次逃脱他的掌握。但这也是惯性的力量；他的灵魂中缺乏适应性，这可以从某些人的身体上看出，当需要避免碰撞时，将衣服从火焰中抢走，或执行任何其他此类必要的动作，慢慢来（俗话说），首先在原来的位置上停留片刻，好像在寻找一个起点，一个力量和运动的源泉。如果车夫打断他说：“我已经找到那位女士了，”他可能会回答说：“哦，是的，当然了；”这就是我告诉你要做的。我完全忘记了，”并会继续讨论他的柴火供应，以便向他的仆人隐瞒他所感受到的情绪，并给自己时间摆脱焦虑的束缚，让自己尽情享受。

The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, ‘I think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.’
然而，车夫回来了，报告说他在任何地方都找不到她，并补充说，作为一个享有特权的老仆人，“我认为，先生，我们现在能做的就是回家。”

But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when Rémi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off cloak when he saw Rémi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest.
但是，当雷米说出他最后的、不可改变的回答时，斯旺原本可以轻松地表现出的冷漠态度，当他看到雷米试图让他放弃希望并退出探索时，他就像一件废弃的斗篷一样从他身上消失了。

‘Certainly not!’ he exclaimed. ‘We must find the lady. It is most important. She would be extremely put out—it’s a business matter—and vexed with me if she didn’t see me.’
“当然不是！”他惊呼道。 “我们必须找到那位女士。这是最重要的。如果她看不到我，她会非常生气——这是生意问题——而且还会生我的气。

‘But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,’ answered Rémi, ‘since it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was going to Prévost’s, and then wasn’t there.’
“但是，先生，我不明白那位女士会生气，”雷米回答道，“因为是她没等您就走了，先生，并说她要去普雷沃斯特家，但后来却不在了。”

Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice.
与此同时，餐馆关门了，灯也开始熄灭。林荫大道的树下，仍然有几个人来来往往，在夜色中几乎看不清。时不时会有一个女人的鬼魂滑到斯旺面前，在他耳边低声说几句话，请求他带她回家，让他浑身发抖。他焦急地探索着每一个隐约可见的形状，仿佛在死者的幽灵中，在黑暗的国度里，他一直在寻找失踪的尤丽狄斯。

Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as—in the moment when she has failed to meet us—for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage—the insensate, agonising desire to possess her.
在所有产生爱的方法中，在所有传播这种神圣祸害的媒介中，很少有比时不时席卷人类精神的巨大骚动更有效的了。因为，我们现在正在与之为伴的那个生物，她的命运已经注定，她和我们的命运也已决定，那就是我们今后要爱的生物。到那时为止，她没有必要再让我们高兴，甚至没有必要像其他人一样高兴。所需要的只是我们对她的品味应该变得独一无二。当她没能见到我们的那一刻，这个条件就得到了满足，因为我们正要在她迷人的陪伴下享受的快乐突然被一种焦虑的折磨欲望所取代，其目标是生物本身，这是一种非理性的、荒谬的欲望，文明社会的法律使它无法满足也难以平息——占有她的无知的、痛苦的欲望。

Swann made Rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette—assuming that she had long since gone home to bed,—might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison Dorée, burst twice into Tortoni’s and, still without catching sight of her, was emerging from the Café Anglais, striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had been no room at Prévost’s, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the Maison Dorée, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage.
斯旺让雷米开车送他去那些还开着的餐馆。现在，这是他如此平静地思考过的幸福的唯一假设。他不再掩饰他的激动，他为他们的会面设定了价格，并承诺，如果成功，奖励他的车夫，仿佛通过激发他的胜利意志，这会增强他自己的胜利意志，他可以把它带到奇迹般地，奥黛特——假设她早已回家睡觉——可能会被发现坐在林荫大道上的某家餐馆里。他一路追寻，一直追到了多雷庄园，两次冲进托尔托尼家，仍然没有看到她，正从英国咖啡馆出来，目光憔悴地大步走向他的马车，马车在林荫大道的拐角处等着他。 des Italiens，当他与相反方向的一个人相撞时；是奥黛特；后来她解释说，普雷沃斯特家已经没有空位了，她去了多雷庄园吃晚饭，坐在壁龛里，他一定在那里忽略了她，而她现在正在寻找她的马车。

She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,—it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth—‘twas from itself that there emanated, ‘twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet.
她没想到会见到他，因此惊慌失措。至于他，他搜遍了巴黎的街道，并不是因为他认为自己有可能找到她，而是因为如果放弃这一尝试，他会遭受更残酷的痛苦。但现在，这种喜悦（他的理智一直向他保证，至少在那天晚上没有实现）突然变得明显，而且比以往任何时候都更加真实。因为他本人并没有通过预测概率对此做出任何贡献——它对于他来说仍然是不可或缺的和外在的；他不需要动用自己的资源来赋予它真理——真理是从它本身发出的，它本身向他投射了真理，它的光辉光芒像梦中的云彩一样融化和散开，一种感觉。孤独压垮了他，而他曾经支撑着、甚至是无意识地建立了他对幸福的憧憬的真理。一个旅行者在一个天气晴朗的日子来到地中海沿岸，怀疑他离开的那些土地是否仍然存在，他也会让他的眼睛感到眩晕，而不是回头看一眼，从他脚下明亮且不褪色的蔚蓝中流向他的光芒。

He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow.
他跟着她上了她一直在等的马车，并命令自己的车跟上。

She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an ‘insertion,’ also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless.
她手里拿着一束卡特兰，斯旺可以看到，在她头上覆盖的蕾丝薄膜下面，更多同样的花朵系在天鹅绒的羽毛上。她在斗篷下面穿着一件飘逸的黑色天鹅绒长袍，长袍的一侧被卷起来，露出白色丝绸裙子上的一大块三角形补丁，在她的裂缝中也有一个“插入物”，也是白色丝绸的。低领紧身胸衣，里面又系了几条卡特兰。她刚从看到斯旺给她带来的震惊中恢复过来，突然有什么障碍物使马向一侧跑去。他们被从座位上抛到了前面。她叫了一声，浑身颤抖，气喘吁吁地向后倒去。

‘It’s all right,’ he assured her, ‘don’t be frightened.’ And he slipped his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went on: ‘Whatever you do, don’t utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or you’ll be out of breath again. You won’t mind if I put the flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I’m afraid of their dropping out; I’m just going to fasten them a little more securely.’
“没关系，”他向她保证，“别害怕。”然后他用手臂搂住她的肩膀，将她的身体靠在自己身上。然后继续说道：“无论你做什么，都不要说话；只要做出一个手势，是或否，否则你会再次上气不接下气。如果我把花直接放在你的紧身胸衣上，你不会介意的；颠簸使它们松动了。我担心他们退学；我只是要把它们系得更牢固一点。

She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and smiled as she answered: ‘No, not at all; I don’t mind in the least.’
她不习惯被男人这么拘谨，微笑着回答：“不，一点也不；”我一点也不介意。

But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: ‘No, no; you mustn’t speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don’t mind my doing this? Look, there is a little—I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,—may I brush it off with my hand? That’s not too hard; I’m not hurting you, am I? I’m tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don’t want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don’t you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn’t. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down.... Seriously, I’m not annoying you, am I? And if I just sniff them to see whether they’ve really lost all their scent? I don’t believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.’
但他对她的回答感到有点寒心，也许也是为了证明他是真诚地采取这一策略的，或者甚至因为他已经开始相信自己是真心实意的，他大声喊道：“不，不；”你不能说话。你又会气喘吁吁。您可以轻松地用手势回答；我会明白的。说实话，你不介意我这么做吧？你看，有一点——我想一定是花粉，洒在你的衣服上了——我可以用手把它擦掉吗？这并不难；我没有伤害你吧？也许我正在让你挠痒痒；但我不想碰天鹅绒，以免擦错了。但是，你没看到吗，我真的必须把花系起来；如果我不这样做的话，他们就会闹翻了。就这样，现在；如果我只是把它们推得更远一点……说真的，我没有烦你，不是吗？如果我只是闻一闻它们是否真的失去了所有气味？我不相信我以前闻过任何气味。我可以？说实话，现在。”

Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should say, ‘You’re quite mad; you know very well that I like it.’
她仍然微笑着，轻轻地耸了耸肩，就像谁应该说：“你很生气；你很生气。”你很清楚我喜欢它。

He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette’s cheek; she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old Florentine’s paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards Swann’s. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body’s movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return.
他将另一只手向上滑过奥黛特的脸颊。她用那种疲倦而庄严的神情注视着他，这正是佛罗伦萨老画作中女性的特征，他在她们的脸上找到了她的类型。她那双明亮的眼睛在流苏般的眼睑边缘游动，和她们的眼睛一样大而精致，似乎即将从脸上脱落，像两颗大泪珠一样顺着脸颊滚落。她弯曲了脖子，就像在异教场景和圣经中可以看到的那样，所有人的脖子都是弯曲的。尽管她的态度无疑是习惯性的和本能的，她知道这种态度适合这种时刻，并且小心翼翼地不要忘记假设，但她似乎需要用尽全身的力量才能将脸往后缩，仿佛有某种无形的力量。正在把它拉向斯旺的。而斯万，在她让自己的脸落在他的嘴唇上之前，仿佛尽管她很努力，她又将脸停留了一会儿，与他的双手之间保持了一点距离。他本来打算留出时间让她的思想超越身体的动作，去认识她长久以来所珍视的梦想，并协助她实现它，就像一位母亲在为自己的孩子颁发奖品时被邀请作为旁观者一样。抚养并热爱。或许，斯万本人也正注视着奥黛特的这些特征，而奥黛特尚未拥有，甚至还没有被他吻过，他现在最后一次看着她，那种全面的目光，在他离开的那天，一个旅行者努力在他的记忆中抹去他可能永远不会回到的国家的景象。

But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: ‘It is most unfortunate; the cattleyas don’t need tucking in this evening; they’ve not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn’t quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?’ Or else, if she had none: ‘Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there’s nothing for me to arrange.’ So that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor ‘Do a cattleya,’ transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying ‘to make love’ had not the precise significance of its synonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be—or be thought to be—so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason—as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise—a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure—and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity—entirely individual and new.
但他在接近她时是如此害羞，以至于在这个晚上之后，从他为她安排卡特兰开始，到她完全投降而结束，无论是因为害怕让她着凉，还是因为不愿意表现出撒谎，甚至回想起来，或者也许是因为他没有勇气提出比这更紧迫的要求（这个要求总是可以重复的，因为第一次并没有惹恼她），他在接下来的几天里又以同样的借口。如果她的紧身胸衣上别着任何卡特兰，他会说：“这是最不幸的；这是最不幸的。”今晚，卡特兰不需要睡觉；他们没有像那天晚上那样受到打扰；不过，我认为这不太直。我可以看看它们是否比其他的有更多的气味吗？”或者，如果她没有：“哦！今晚没有卡特兰；所以，有一段时间，他所遵循的程序与第一晚没有任何变化，当时他先用手指，然后用嘴唇触摸她的喉咙，但是他们的爱抚总是从这种适度的探索开始。很久以后，当她的卡特亚的安排（或者更确切地说，安排的仪式假装）已经完全废弃时，隐喻“做一个卡特亚”就变成了一个简单的动词，他们在使用时不考虑它的含义当他们希望提及物质占有行为时（矛盾的是，占有者一无所有），这个词的原始含义在他们的词汇中得以保留，以纪念长期被遗忘的习俗。然而，这种“做爱”的特殊表达方式可能并不具有其同义词的确切含义。 无论我们对女性的幻想破灭，无论我们如何将占有哪怕是最不同的类型视为一种不变的、单调的体验，其中的每一个细节都是已知的、可以提前描述的，但如果有关的女性——或者被认为是——如此困难，以至于迫使我们将我们的攻击建立在我们与她们的关系中一些未经排练的事件上，就像斯旺最初安排的卡特亚斯那样。那天晚上，他浑身颤抖，正如他所希望的那样（但是奥黛特，他告诉自己，如果她被他的计谋欺骗了，她就猜不到他的意图），对这个女人的占有将从他们庞大而色彩丰富的世界中浮现出来。花瓣；他认为，他已经感受到的快乐，奥黛特所忍受的快乐，也许只是因为她自己还没有意识到这一点，在他看来就是这个原因——就像第一个男人在人群中享受这种快乐时的感觉一样。人间天堂的花朵——一种以前从未存在过的快乐，他现在正在努力创造一种快乐——他要给它起的特殊名字保留了它的身份——完全个性化和新颖。

The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: ‘What on earth does it matter what people see?’ And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins’ (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when—more and more rarely—he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: ‘He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,’ made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins’ before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon’s, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the piano, some of her favourite music, the Valse des Roses, the Pauvre Fou of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil’s sonata. It was true that Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little phrase was associated still, in Swann’s mind, with his love for Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette’s qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of Swann’s soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts of Swann’s soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette’s affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching Swann’s face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,—for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,—to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how much secret and unap-peased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: ‘How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can’t do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me?’ Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli’s ‘Life of Moses,’ he would place it there, giving to Odette’s neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy—by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins’—might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind’s eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another.
冰面一旦破裂，每天晚上，当他带她回家时，他必须跟着她进屋；她常常会穿着晨衣再次出来，护送他上马车，并当着马车夫的面亲吻他，说道：“人们看到的到底有什么关系？”没有去维尔迪兰家（这种情况偶尔会发生，因为他有机会在其他地方见到奥黛特），当他进入社会时——越来越少见——她会恳求他在回家的路上来找她，无论多晚他可能是。时节正是春天，夜晚晴朗而寒冷。他会从晚会结束后，跳上他的维多利亚，在膝盖上铺上一块地毯，告诉同时离开的朋友，以及坚持要他和他们一起回家的朋友，他不能，他是不朝他们的方向走；然后车夫就会快步出发，无需进一步的命令，他非常清楚自己要去哪里。他的朋友们一定会惊叹不已，事实上，斯旺已经不再是原来的那个人了。现在没有人收到过他要求介绍一位女士的信。他不再关注女人，也远离她们通常会见的地方。在餐馆里，或者在乡下，他的举止故意与几天前他的朋友们认出他时的举止截然相反，那种举止似乎永远是他自己的。在某种程度上，激情在我们身上表现为一种暂时的、独特的性格，它不仅取代了我们正常的性格，而且实际上消除了迄今为止可以辨别的性格的迹象。 另一方面，现在有一件事是不变的，那就是无论斯万晚上去哪里，他都会在事后继续前往奥黛特那里。她和他之间的空间间隔是他​​必须不可避免地穿越的空间间隔，就像他必须在不可抗拒的引力作用下走下生命本身的陡坡一样。坦白说，很多时候，当他在聚会上呆到很晚的时候，他宁愿立即回家，也不用走那么远，把见面推迟到明天；但是，他宁愿不走那么远，也宁愿把见面推迟到明天。但事实是，他在一个不正常的时间里冒着如此不便去探望她，而他猜他的朋友们在他离开时正在互相说：“他的手脚都被绑住了；他的手脚都被绑住了。” “肯定有一个女人坚持要他随时去找她”，这让他觉得自己过着这样一种男人的生活，他们的存在被爱情染上了色彩，在他们身上，永远的牺牲他们使自己的舒适和实际利益产生了精神魅力。然后，尽管他可能没有有意识地考虑到这一点，但她确信她在等他，她不在任何地方或与其他任何人在一起，他回家之前会看到她，这让他从痛苦中感到刺痛，忘记了确实如此，但潜在的，随时准备被重新唤醒，当奥黛特在他到达之前离开维尔迪兰家的那个晚上，他就感受到了这种痛苦，这种痛苦的实际停止是如此令人愉快，甚至可以被称为一种状态的幸福。也许正是由于那段痛苦的时刻，奥黛特才在他的生活中占据了重要地位。 一般来说，其他人对我们来说是如此无关紧要，以至于当我们将给自己带来如此多痛苦或幸福的力量托付给他们中的任何一个人时，那个人似乎立刻就属于一个不同的宇宙，被周围的人所包围。诗歌，使我们的生活变得广阔无垠，充满感觉，在其中，那个人和我们自己或多或少地产生了联系。斯万不禁焦虑地问自己，奥黛特在未来的岁月里对他意味着什么。有时候，在早春那些晴朗、霜冻的夜晚，当他从维多利亚的窗户上抬起头来，看到耀眼的月光落在他的眼前和空荡荡的街道之间时，他就会想起那张脸，那张脸像月亮一样闪闪发光，略带玫瑰色，有一天，它出现在他心灵的地平线上，从那时起，它就向世界洒下了他所看到的沐浴在其中的神秘光芒。如果他在奥黛特送仆人上床睡觉的时间之后到达，在按响她的小花园门口的门铃之前，他会先绕到另一条街上，在这条街上，在地面上，在窗户之间（隔壁房子的一切都一模一样，只是颜色变暗了，照耀着她房间里唯一一扇亮着灯的窗户。他会敲击窗玻璃，她会听到信号并回答，然后跑到门口迎接他。他会在钢琴上找到一些她最喜欢的音乐，《玫瑰圆舞曲》、《塔利亚菲科的贫穷之歌》（根据她遗嘱中的指示，将在她的葬礼上演奏）；但他会要求她把凡特伊奏鸣曲中的小句给他。 奥黛特的演奏确实很糟糕，但我们心中对最喜欢的曲子最公正的印象往往是由不熟练的手指在一架不调音的钢琴上敲出的一堆错误的音符而产生的。在斯旺的心中，这句话仍然与他对奥黛特的爱联系在一起。他清楚地感觉到，这种爱是没有相应的外在迹象的，其意义除了他自己无法证明。他还意识到，奥黛特的品质不足以证明他对在她陪伴下度过的时间如此看重是合理的。通常，当理性的冷酷统治不受挑战时，他很乐意不再为了这种想象中的快乐而牺牲自己的许多智力和社会利益。但这短短的一句话，一旦传入他的耳中，就有能力解放他所需要的容纳它的房间；斯旺灵魂的比例发生了改变；为一种享受形式留出了余地，这种享受形式只不过是他对奥黛特的爱与任何外在对象相对应，但并不像他对这种爱的享受一样，纯粹是个人的，而是为他假定了一种优于其他人的客观现实。具体的事情。这种对未尝过的魅力的渴望，这句话会重新激发他的渴望，但不会给他带来任何明确的满足来缓解它。结果，斯旺灵魂中的那些部分，在这短短的一句话中，抹去了对物质利益的所有关心，那些影响所有人的人性考虑，都被它留下了，变成了空白的页面，他可以在上面自由地写下他的名字。奥黛特。 此外，奥黛特的感情可能显得那么唐突和令人失望，而这句话却会补充它，将其神秘的本质与它融合在一起。听着这句话时，看着斯旺的脸，人们会说他正在吸入一种麻醉剂，让他呼吸得更深。音乐给他带来的快乐，很快就会在他心中产生一种真正的渴望，事实上，在这样的时刻，他从尝试香水、从与世界签订契约中获得的快乐非常相似。我们人类并不是为此而被创造的，它似乎缺乏形式，因为我们的眼睛无法感知它，缺乏意义，因为它逃脱了我们的智力，而我们只能通过一种感觉来获得它。深度的休息，对斯万来说是一种神秘的提神——对于他来说，他的眼睛虽然是绘画的精致诠释者，他的思想虽然是礼仪的敏锐观察者，但他的生活的贫瘠必须永远留下不可磨灭的印记——感觉自己变成了这是一种对人类来说陌生的生物，失明了，被剥夺了逻辑能力，几乎是一只神奇的独角兽，一种像嵌合体一样的生物，仅通过两只耳朵意识到世界。尽管如此，当他在这短短的短语中寻找他的智力无法理解的意义时，他必须怀着一种奇怪的陶醉的狂乱，脱掉他内心深处的全部理性盔甲，让它在无人看管的情况下通过，穿过过滤容器，进入黑暗的声音过滤器。他开始计算这句话的甜蜜背后有多少痛苦，甚至可能还有多少秘密和无法平息的悲伤；然而这并没有给他带来任何痛苦。 当他的爱如此强烈时，尽管那句话重复着“爱是脆弱而转瞬即逝的”又有什么关系呢！他玩弄着这句话所弥漫的忧郁，他觉得它偷偷地笼罩着他，但就像一种爱抚，只会加深和甜蜜他对自己幸福的感觉。他会让奥黛特再给他弹一遍这个乐句，连续十次、二十次，并坚持要求她在弹奏时永远不能停止亲吻他。每一个吻都会激起另一个吻。啊，在爱情的最初岁月里，亲吻是多么自然地融入生活啊。它们的数量如此之多，是多么紧密地相互挤压；直到恋人们发现，数一小时内交换的吻就像数五月草地上的花朵一样困难。然后她会假装停下来，说道：‘你一直抱着我，你还指望我怎么玩？我无法一次做完所有事情。下定决心你想要什么；是我来玩这个乐句，还是你想和我一起玩？”然后他就会生气，而她就会爆发出一阵笑声，笑声在离开她的嘴唇时发生了变化，以如雨般的吻落到他身上。 。否则，她会阴沉地看着他，而他会再次看到一张值得在波提切利的《摩西的一生》中描绘的脸，他会把它放在那里，给奥黛特的脖子必要的倾斜；十五世纪，当他在西斯廷的墙上完成了她在瘟疫中的肖像时，他想到她仍然和他一起在房间里，在钢琴旁，在那一刻，准备好了被亲吻和赢得，她物质存在的想法，她还活着的想法，会以如此强烈的陶醉席卷他，以至于他的眼睛从他的头和下巴张开，仿佛要吞噬她，他会扑向这个女人。波提切利少女，亲吻并咬她的脸颊。 然后，他一离开家，就再次回来亲吻她，因为他忘记在记忆中带走她的香气或容貌的一些细节，而当他开车回家时，他忘记了带走她的记忆。维多利亚，祝福奥黛特的名字，她允许他每天拜访她，尽管他觉得这不能给她带来任何巨大的幸福，但是，通过让他免受嫉妒的狂热——通过远离他那天晚上，当他在韦尔迪兰家找不到她时，他身上出现的心脏病再次爆发的可能性可能会帮助他到达，而不会再次出现那些危机，其中第一个危机已经发生了。如此令人痛苦，以至于这也一定是他一生中这一系列奇怪的几个小时结束时的最后一个小时，这些小时几乎是令人着迷的，就像其他几个小时一样，在这几个小时里，他乘着灯光开车穿过一个荒凉的巴黎。月球：当他开车回家时注意到卫星现在已经改变了相对于他自己的位置，并且几乎触及地平线；他感到他的爱也服从这些不可改变的自然法则，他问自己，他所进入的这段时期是否会持续更长的时间，他的心灵之眼是否很快就会不再看到那张亲爱的面容，除非占据着一个遥远而被削弱的位置，并且濒临停止向他散发魅力的光芒。自从陷入爱情之后，斯万再次在事物中找到了魅力，就像他在青春期时幻想自己是一名艺术家时所发现的那样。与此不同的是，现在她们身上的魅力是奥黛特一个人赋予的。 他能感到自己童年时的灵感重新苏醒，这些灵感在晚年的琐事中消散了，但现在，它们都带有一个特定存在的反射和印记；现在，在家里度过的漫长时光里，他发现了一种微妙的乐趣，独自一人与康复中的精神相处，他逐渐恢复了自己，但自己却受制于他人。

He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a ‘tart,’ a ‘kept’ woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words.
他只在晚上去找她，对她白天如何度过一无所知，就像他对她的过去一无所知一样。事实上，他甚至没有任何微小的、最初的线索，通过让我们想象我们不知道的事情，激发预知的欲望。所以他从来没有问过自己她可能在做什么，或者她的生活是什么样的。只是有时他会微笑，想到几年前，当他还不认识她时，有人对他谈到过一个女人，如果他没记错的话，肯定是奥黛特，就像一个“妓女”， “一个‘保守’的女人，他仍然认为（很少与她们相处）整套特征的女人之一，这些特征从根本上来说是反常的，多年来，她们被某些特定的想象力赋予了这些特征。”小说家。他常常对自己说，一个人必须与世界所创造的声誉完全对应，才能公平地评价一个人，当他与奥黛特的性格进行对比时，如此优秀，如此简单，如此热衷于追求理想，如此几乎无法不说实话，当他曾经恳求她，以便他们可以单独一起吃饭时，写信给夫人。维尔迪兰说她身体不舒服，第二天他就见到了她，与维尔迪兰夫人面对面。维尔迪兰问她是否康复了，她脸红了，结结巴巴，脸上不由自主地流露出撒谎对她来说是多么痛苦和折磨。在她的回答中，她虚构了一种想象中的疾病的细节，似乎在通过她恳求的表情和她的口音来请求原谅，因为她的话明显是虚假的。

On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Crécy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette’s blushing countenance, as soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear—changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks—an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love, had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance, would describe Odette’s figure, as he had seen her, that very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life—a life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him—of his mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom.
然而，在某些日子里，虽然这种情况很少发生，但她会在下午拜访他，打断他的沉思或他最近回来的关于维梅尔的文章。他的仆人会进来说夫人。德·克雷西在小客厅里。他会去寻找她，当他打开门时，奥黛特一看到斯万，她就红着脸，她的嘴唇的弧度、她的眼神、她的造型都发生了变化。脸颊——迷人的微笑。一旦只剩下他一个人，他就会再次看到那个微笑，还有她前一天的微笑，另一个她在其他时候向他打招呼的微笑，那天晚上在马车上，当他问她是否她反对他重新安排她的卡特兰；而奥黛特在其他时候的生活，因为他对此一无所知，在他看来，都是在中性和无色的背景上出现的，就像华托的那些素描，人们可以在上面看到，这里那里，每个角落和各个方向，在米黄纸上用三种颜色描绘出无数的微笑。但是，偶尔，照亮斯万仍然认为是完全空白的存在的缝隙，即使他的头脑向他保证事实并非如此，因为他无法想象任何可能占据它的东西，一些朋友知道他们两人都怀疑自己正在恋爱，不敢告诉他任何关于她的最不重要的事情，所以就描述了奥黛特的身材，就像他那天早上在阿巴塔奇街步行时所看到的那样，身穿饰有臭鼬的斗篷，戴着伦勃朗帽子，怀里抱着一束紫罗兰。 这个简单的轮廓使斯旺陷入了彻底的混乱，因为他突然意识到奥黛特的存在并不完全服从于他自己的存在；他的存在并不完全服从于他的存在。他很想知道她一直想用这套他从未见过她的服装来迷住谁。他发誓要坚持让她告诉他在那一刻她去了哪里，仿佛在他情妇的所有平淡无奇的生活中——一种几乎不存在的生活，因为那时她对他来说是看不见的——除了那些对自己微笑的人之外，还有一件事情；也就是说，她戴着伦勃朗的帽子，怀里抱着一束紫罗兰，在国外散步。

Except when he asked her for Vinteuil’s little phrase instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: ‘I’m sure, poetry; well, of course, there’d be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you’ll find there’s no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he’d finished.’ If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: ‘Yes... I never thought it would be like that.’ And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, ‘More in it? What?... Do tell me!’, but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love.
除了当他问她要万特伊的小乐句而不是玫瑰圆舞曲时，斯旺并没有努力引导她演奏他自己喜欢的东西，也没有在文学和音乐中纠正她品味中的多种错误。 。他彻底意识到，她并不聪明。当她说她多么希望他告诉她关于伟大诗人的事时，她想象着她会突然了解整页浪漫和英雄的诗篇，采用博雷利子爵的风格，只会更加动人。至于代尔夫特的维米尔，她问他是否被一个女人所折磨，是否是一个女人给了他灵感，一旦斯旺告诉她没有人知道，她就对那位画家失去了所有兴趣。她经常说：“我确信，诗歌；”好吧，当然，如果这一切都是真的，如果诗人真的相信他们所说的事情，那就不会有这样的事情了。但你常常会发现，没有人比这些家伙更卑鄙、更精于算计。我对诗歌有所了解。我曾经有一个朋友，他爱上了一位诗人。在他的诗中，除了爱、天堂和星星之外，他从未谈论过任何其他东西。哦！她被正确地接纳了！在他完成之前，他已经从她那里得到了超过三十万法郎。” 那么，如果斯万试图向她展示什么是艺术美，一个人应该如何欣赏诗歌或绘画，一两分钟后她就会停止听着，说：“是的……我从没想过会是这样。”他觉得她太失望了，所以他宁愿对她撒谎，向她保证他所说的没什么，他已经只触及了表面，他没有时间深入探讨，里面的内容远不止这些。 然后她会轻快地打断道：“还有更多内容吗？”什么？……请告诉我！”，但他没有告诉她，因为他意识到这对她来说显得多么琐碎，与她的预期多么不同，不那么耸人听闻，也不那么感人；他还担心，她对艺术的幻想破灭了，同时对爱情的大事也幻灭了。

With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. ‘You’re always so reserved; I can’t make you out.’ She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas—for those are entirely beyond them—but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann’s social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. ‘But,’ Swann objected, ‘surely, people don’t all know your friend.’ ‘Yes, don’t you see, it’s like a spot of oil; people are so horrid.’ Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as ‘People are so horrid,’ and ‘A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,’ were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette’s case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance—with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre—over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People ‘in society’ know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic—common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed—of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of ‘fashionable people,’ is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: ‘He never goes to any place that isn’t really smart.’
结果，她发现斯万在智力上不如她想象的那样。 ‘你总是那么矜持；我听不清你的意思。”她越来越惊叹于他对金钱的漠不关心、他对每个人都彬彬有礼、心思细腻。事实上，对于比斯万更伟大的人来说，对于一位科学家或艺术家来说，当他没有被他生活在其中的人们完全误解时，他们内心的感觉证明他们已经相信了他的才智的优越性并不是来自于对他的思想的钦佩——因为这些思想完全超出了他们——而是来自于他们对他们所说的他的优良品质的尊重。奥黛特也对斯旺的社会地位感到尊重，尽管她并不希望他试图为自己争取邀请。也许她觉得这样的尝试注定会失败；也许她觉得这样的尝试注定会失败。或许，她确实担心，仅仅因为向他的朋友们谈论她，他就会引起不受欢迎的泄密。事实仍然是，她一直要求他遵守诺言，永远不要提及她的名字。她告诉他，她不愿踏入社交圈的原因是，很久以前，她和另一个女孩发生了争吵，那个女孩为了报复，说她的坏话。 “但是，”斯万反对道，“当然，人们并不都认识你的朋友。”坦率地说，斯旺无法理解这一点；另一方面，他知道诸如“人是如此可怕”和“丑闻如一滴油一样传播”之类的概括被普遍认为是正确的。因此，必须存在它们确实适用的情况。奥黛特的案子可能是其中之一吗？ 他用这个问题取笑自己，虽然时间不长，因为每当他遇到困难的问题时，他也会受到精神上的压迫，就像他父亲那样。无论如何，那个对奥黛特隐藏着如此恐惧的社会世界给了她启发，也许她并没有太大的渴望进入它，因为它离她已经熟悉的世界太远了，她无法形成任何清晰的认识。它的构想。与此同时，虽然在某些方面她保留了真正的简单（例如，她与一位现已退休的小裁缝保持着友谊，她几乎每天都爬上他陡峭、黑暗、恶臭的楼梯）尽管她的想法并不完全是时尚人士所持有的，但她仍然渴望走在时尚的前沿。对于后者来说，时尚是一种源于相对少数领导者的事物，他们将时尚投射到相当大的距离——根据一个人离他们的亲密中心更近或更远，其强度或多或少——在他们不断扩大的圈子上。朋友和他们朋友的朋友，他们的名字形成了一种列表索引。 “社会上的”人们熟记在心，他们在这些问题上具有博学的天赋，他们从中提取了一种品味和机智，其运作是如此自动，以至于斯旺，例如，不需要利用他的世界的知识，如果他在报纸上读到参加晚宴的客人的名字，他可以立即知道晚宴有多流行，就像一个文人仅通过读一个短语就可以估计正是其作者的文学价值。 但奥黛特属于这样的人之一（无论时尚界怎么想，这是一个极其众多的阶层，并且在社会的各个阶层都可以找到），他们不分享这些知识，但将时尚想象成完全另一种类型的东西，它假设根据他们自己所属的圈子，他们有不同的方面，但都有特殊的特征——与奥黛特曾经梦想的时尚和以前的女士相似。科塔尔鞠躬——所有人都可以直接接触。另一种，即“时尚人士”的时尚，必须承认，也是可以接触到的。但延误是不可避免的。奥黛特会这样评价某人：“他从来不会去任何不聪明的地方。”’

And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, ‘Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there’s the Avenue de l’Impératrice, and round the lake at five o’clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Théâtre, and thé Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls...’
如果斯旺问她这是什么意思，她会带着一丝轻蔑地回答：“聪明的地方！”天哪，真想不到，在你这个年纪，不得不被告知巴黎有哪些聪明的地方！你希望我说什么？周日早上有帝国大道，五点钟有环湖表演，周四有伊甸园剧院，周五有竞技场。然后还有球……”

‘What balls?’
“什么球？”

‘Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean. Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who’s in one of the jobbers’ offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he’s one of the best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I couldn’t get one anywhere. After all, I’m just as glad, now, that I didn’t go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger’s ball. You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you weren’t there, a regular ‘tip-topper’ like you.’
“哎呀，傻瓜，人们在巴黎举行的舞会；我是说，聪明的人。等等，赫宾格，你知道我指的是谁，就是在一间临时工办公室里的那个人；是的，当然，你一定认识他，他是巴黎最有名的男人之一，那个金发大男孩，穿着如此招摇的衣服；他的纽扣孔里总是别着一朵花，穿着一件背后有褶子的浅色大衣。他带着那个旧形象到处走动，带她参加所有的初夜。很好！那天晚上他举办了一个舞会，巴黎所有的聪明人都参加了。我本来应该很想去的！但你必须在门口出示请柬，而我到处都找不到。毕竟，现在我很高兴我没有去。我本应该在这场车祸中被杀，然后什么也没看到。尽管如此，只是为了能够说有人去过赫宾格的舞会。你知道我是多么虚荣！然而，你可能很确定，告诉你他们在那里的人中有一半都是在讲故事……但令我惊讶的是，像你这样一个经常‘给小费的人’却不在那里。

Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings.
然而，斯旺并没有试图改变这种时尚概念。他觉得自己的观点与事实相差甚远，同样愚蠢，毫无重要性，他认为将其传授给他的情妇没有任何好处，结果几个月后，她不再接受任何建议。对他所去过的人的家感兴趣，除非他们是他获得赛马场围场门票或剧院第一晚门票的手段。她希望他能继续结交这些有利可图的熟人，但自从她在街上经过穿着黑色哔叽连衣裙、戴着带绳子的帽子的维尔帕里西斯侯爵夫人那天起，她就开始认为他们不那么聪明了。

‘But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a marquise! Goodness knows I’m not a marquise, but you’d have to pay me a lot of money before you’d get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!’
“但她看起来就像一个开座位的人，就像一个老女佣，亲爱的！那是一位侯爵夫人！天知道我不是侯爵夫人，但你得付给我很多钱才能让我像那样去巴黎！”

Nor could she understand Swann’s continuing to live in his house on the Quai d’Orléans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered unworthy of him.
她也无法理解斯万继续住在他位于奥尔良码头的房子里，尽管她不敢告诉他，但她认为那所房子配不上他。

It was true that she claimed to be fond of ‘antiques,’ and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day ‘rummaging’ in second-hand shops, hunting for ‘bric-à-brac,’ and things of the ‘right date.’ Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was ‘of the period.’ Swann could not get her to tell him what ‘period’ it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was ‘mediaeval’; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one’s hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one’s listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: ‘Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!’ Incidentally, she had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Château at Blois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of his abode on the Quai d’Orléans; he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming, but in the ‘Sham-Antique.’
确实，她声称自己喜欢“古董”，当她承认自己喜欢整天在二手店“翻箱倒柜”，寻找“古玩”时，她总是表现出一种欣喜若狂、懂事的神情。尽管这是一种荣誉，但她顽固地坚持这一点，就好像遵守一些古老的家庭习俗一样，她永远不应该回答任何问题，永远不要对她所做的事情做出任何解释白天，她有一次跟斯万谈起一位朋友的事，她被邀请去他家做客，发现里面的一切都是“那个时代的”。斯万无法让她告诉他那是什么“时代”。她想了想才回答说那是“中世纪”；她的意思是墙壁上镶有镶板。一段时间后，她再次向他谈到她的朋友，并用一种​​犹豫但自信的语气补充道，这种语气是指前一天晚上在晚餐时在某个地方见过的一个人，在那之前人们从未听说过他，但主人似乎认为她是一位如此著名和重要的人，以至于人们希望听众能够清楚地知道他指的是谁，并且会留下深刻的印象：“她的餐厅……是……十八世纪的！”顺便说一句，她觉得它很丑陋，光秃秃的，就好像房子还没有完工一样。女人穿上它看起来很可怕，而且它永远不会成为时尚。 她第三次再次提到这件事，当时她向斯万展示了一张卡片，上面写着设计餐厅的人的姓名和地址，当她有足够的钱时，她想派人去找他，看看他是否可以不要也为她做一件；当然，不是这样的，而是她曾经梦想的那种，不幸的是，她的小房子不够大，无法像布卢瓦城堡那样容纳高高的餐具柜、文艺复兴时期的家具和壁炉。正是在这个场合，她向斯万吐露了她对他在奥尔良码头的住所的真实想法。他冒昧地提出了她朋友所沉迷的批评，但不是路易十六风格的批评，因为，他继续说，尽管这当然没有完成，但它仍然可以变得迷人，但在“假古董”中。’

‘You wouldn’t have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs and threadbare carpets!’ she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the ‘light woman.’
“你不会让她像你一样生活在一堆破椅子和破旧的地毯中间！”她惊呼道，中产阶级家庭主妇与生俱来的体面，通过后天对“光”的业余爱好，冲动地浮出水面。女士。'

People who enjoyed ‘picking-up’ things, who admired poetry, despised sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she would come home saying: ‘Why, he’s an adorable creature; so sensitive! I had no idea,’ and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add, pouting: ‘It’s not the same thing, you see, with him,’ and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary.
那些喜欢“拾取”东西、欣赏诗歌、鄙视肮脏的损益计算、崇尚荣誉和爱情理想的人，她把他们自己归入一个比其他人更优越的阶层。实际上，没有必要拥有这些品味，只要人们对它们谈论得足够多即可。当一个男人在晚餐时告诉她，他喜欢在旧家具店里闲逛，双手沾满灰尘，在这个商业时代，他永远不会被真正欣赏，因为他不关心那些感兴趣的事情。当她得知他完全属于另一代人时，她回家时会说：“嘿，他是一个可爱的生物；他是一个可爱的人。”太敏感了！我不知道，”她会为他构想出一种强烈而突然的友谊。但另一方面，像斯旺这样有这些品味但不说出来的男人却让她感到冷漠。当然，她不得不承认斯旺在金钱上是最慷慨的，但她会撅着嘴补充道：“你看，这和他不是一回事。”事实上，什么吸引了斯旺？她的想象力不是无私的实践，而是无私的词汇。

Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the Reine Topaze, or when her eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman’s certificate of ‘smartness,’ Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips. ‘Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her wishes.’ As Swann’s sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: ‘I really do think—for a man, that is to say—it is tremendously smart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!’ she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an educated, ‘society’ woman would have understood them no better, but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went again to Serge Panine, if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch Olivier Métra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette’s mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished ‘man of the world,’ had gradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her.
他常常觉得自己无法在现实中给她梦想中的快乐，所以他至少尽力确保她在他的陪伴下感到快乐，尽量不去反驳那些粗俗的想法，以及她在每件事上表现出的低级趣味。可能的场合，尽管如此，他还是很喜欢，因为他情不自禁地喜欢她身上的一切，这甚至让他着迷，因为它们不是更多的那些特征，凭借这些特征，女人的基本品质得以显现，并且变得可见？所以，当她因为要去看王后黄玉而心情愉快时，或者当她的眼神变得严肃、不安、暴躁时，或者当她害怕错过花展，或者只是害怕赶不上时，斯旺在皇家街的茶室里喝茶，配上松饼和烤面包，她相信定期出席是必不可少的，并在女性“聪明”证书上盖上了印章，她有时会像我们所有人一样欣喜若狂，通过一个孩子的自然行为，或者通过一幅肖像，似乎即将说话，他会如此明显地感觉到他的情妇的灵魂升起，充满了她的脸的轮廓，以至于他无法克制不住地走过去穿过并用嘴唇欢迎它。 “哦，那么，小奥黛特希望我们带她去看花展，是吗？她想要被人钦佩，是吗？很好，我们会带她去那里，我们只能听从她的意愿。”随着斯万的视力开始衰退，他不得不戴上一副眼镜，在家工作时戴着它来面对世界。他戴了一副眼镜，这样不至于毁容。当她第一次看到他的眼睛时，她忍不住高兴起来：“我确实认为——对于一个男人来说——这是非常聪明的！” 你戴上它看起来多好看啊！每一寸都是绅士。你现在想要的只是一个头衔！”她总结道，语气中带着一丝遗憾。他喜欢奥黛特说这些话，就像如果他爱上了一个布列塔尼女孩，他会很高兴看到她戴着头巾，听她说她相信鬼魂一样。直到那时，正如那些对美术的品味独立于其感性而发展的人中常见的那样，他同时给予任一品味的满足之间存在着一种怪异的差异；屈服于艺术作品的诱惑，随着他喜欢的女人变得越来越文盲和普通，这种诱惑变得越来越微妙，他会带着一个小女仆到剧院的一个放映包厢里，那里有一些颓废的作品。他本来希望观看表演，或者观看印象派绘画展览，而且他坚信，一个受过教育的“社会”女性不会更好地理解它们，但也不会如此漂亮地对它们保持沉默。但是，现在他爱上了奥黛特，这一切都改变了。分享她的同情心，努力在精神上与她合一，这是一项如此有吸引力的任务，以至于他试图在她喜欢的事物中找到满足感，并且确实找到了乐趣，不仅在模仿她的习惯中，而且在采纳她的意见中，更深层的原因是，这些习惯和观点并非源于她的智慧，它们对他来说除了爱之外没有任何意义，因此他更喜欢它们而不是自己的爱。 如果他再次去塞尔日·帕尼，如果他寻找机会观看奥利维尔·梅特拉的指挥，那是因为他能体会到奥黛特脑海中的每一个想法，感到自己在所有事情上都有平等的份额。她的口味。她最喜欢的戏剧、图画和地点所具有的这种让他更接近她的魅力，让他觉得比更美丽的事物和地点的内在魅力更加神秘，后者以其美丽吸引着他，但却无法回忆起她。此外，在他年轻时的理智信念逐渐变得微弱之后，直到他作为一个完完全全的“世俗之人”的怀疑主义逐渐在不知不觉中渗透到这些信念中，他坚持（或者至少他坚持了这么久，以至于他已经堕落了）。习惯上说）我们所欣赏的物体本身并没有绝对的价值，整个事情只是日期和种姓的问题，并且由一系列时尚组成，其中最庸俗的价值与那些被认为是最精致的。他认为奥黛特对私人观点的重视程度本身并不比他自己有一次与威尔士亲王共进午餐时所感受到的快乐更荒谬，所以他没有我认为她对蒙特卡洛或里吉人所表示的钦佩比他自己对荷兰（她认为荷兰是丑陋的）和凡尔赛（这让她厌烦得要流泪）的喜欢更不合理。因此，他拒绝了自己去那些地方的乐趣，并安慰自己，他是为了她才希望去感受、不喜欢任何她不同样感受到和喜欢的东西。

Like everything else that formed part of Odette’s environment, and was no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even the infrequent ‘big evenings’ when they entertained ‘bores,’ there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little ‘nucleus’ than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins’ (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her was all that he could ask. ‘What a charming atmosphere!’ he said to himself. ‘How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare exceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more and more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.’
就像构成奥黛特环境一部分的其他事物一样，从某种意义上说，它们只不过是他可以更频繁地见到她并与她交谈的手段，他喜欢维尔迪兰一家的交往。与他们一起，从那时起，在他们所有的娱乐活动、晚餐、音乐之夜、游戏、化装晚宴、乡村旅行、戏剧派对，甚至是他们招待“无聊”的罕见“盛大夜晚”的核心，都有奥黛特的存在，奥黛特的视线，与奥黛特的交谈，维尔迪兰夫妇邀请他到他们家来，给斯旺带来了不可估量的恩惠，他在这个小小的“核心”中比在其他任何地方都更快乐，并试图找到一些真正的东西。每个成员都有自己的优点，想象着他的品味会引导他在余生中经常光顾他们的社团。从来不敢自言自语，以免他怀疑这个建议的真实性，即他将永远爱着奥黛特，至少当他试图假设他总是会去维尔迪兰家时（这个命题，先验地，就他的智力而言，提出的基本反对意见较少），他看到自己的未来继续每天晚上与奥黛特见面；也许，这与他永久地爱着她并不完全一样，但在他爱着她的那一刻，他感到自己不会有一天不再见到她，这就是全部。他可以问。 “多么迷人的气氛啊！”他自言自语道。 “对于这些人来说，生活是多么真实啊！毫无疑问，他们比人们认识的人更聪明、更有艺术性。女士。维尔迪兰虽然有一些荒唐可笑的夸张，但他对绘画和音乐有着真诚的热爱！对艺术作品的热情是多么强烈，对给艺术家带来快乐是多么的渴望！ 她对一些认识的人的看法不太对，但他们对艺术圈的看法就完全错误了！也许我对谈话没有提出很高的智力要求，但我非常高兴与科塔德交谈，尽管他确实会说那些愚蠢的双关语。至于画家，虽然他在试图自相矛盾时受到了相当不愉快的影响，但他仍然拥有我所见过的最聪明的大脑之一。另外，最重要的是，在那里感觉很自由，可以做自己喜欢的事，没有约束，没有大惊小怪。客厅里每天都洋溢着多么幽默的气氛啊！当然，除了极少数例外，我再也不想去其他地方了。这将越来越成为一种习惯，我将在他们中间度过余生。’

And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: ‘Odette! You’ll see M. Swann home, won’t you?’; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was ‘a great and noble soul.’ Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, ‘I’d a hundred times rather,’ he would reply, ‘have the Verdurins.’ And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: ‘They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!’ he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, ‘The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain—how could they?—without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy.’
由于他认为是维尔迪兰性格的内在部分的品质实际上只不过是他在他们的社会中因对奥黛特的爱而享受到的快乐的肤浅反映，所以这些品质变得更加严肃，更加深刻，随着快乐的增加，变得更加重要。自从女士。维尔迪兰时不时地给了斯旺什么才能构成他的幸福。那天晚上，他感到焦虑，因为奥黛特与其中一个人交谈的次数多于与另一个人交谈的次数，而且在一阵恼怒中，他没有主动问她是否要回家，奥黛特夫人。维尔迪兰自发地喊道：“奥黛特！你会送斯旺先生回家的，不是吗？自从暑假到来之后，他不安地问自己，奥黛特是否会在没有他的情况下离开巴黎，他是否还能每天见到她，夫人。维尔迪兰打算邀请他们俩一起去乡下过夏天。斯旺不知不觉地让感恩和自利渗透到他的智慧中并影响他的想法，甚至宣称夫人。维尔迪兰是“一个伟大而高贵的灵魂。”如果他在卢浮宫绘画学院的任何一位老同学向他谈论某个罕见或杰出的艺术家，“我宁愿一百次，”他会回答说，“维尔迪兰一家。”他用一种新的严肃的措辞说道：“他们是宽宏大量的生物，而宽宏大量毕竟是最重要的一件事，也是我们在地球上脱颖而出的一件事。 你看，世上只有两类人，一种是宽宏大量的人，另一种是普通人。我已经到了必须选边站的年纪，要一劳永逸地决定自己喜欢谁，不喜欢谁，要坚持自己喜欢的人，要弥补自己和别人浪费的时间，只要活着就永远不会再离开他们。很好！”他继续说道，带着一种轻微的情感，就像一个人，即使没有完全意识到自己在做什么，他说了一些话，不是因为这是真的，而是因为他喜欢说这句话，并且听他自己的话声音仿佛是从别人嘴里发出来的：“骰子已经掷出；现在是时候了。”我选择只爱宽宏大量的灵魂，并且只生活在宽宏大量的氛围中。你问我女士是否。维尔迪兰确实很聪明。我可以向你保证，她向我证明了我内心的高贵，灵魂的崇高，如果没有相应的崇高思想，任何人都不可能达到这一点——他们怎么可能做到呢？毫无疑问，她对艺术有着深刻的理解。但也许她最令人钦佩的并不是这一点；而是她最令人钦佩的地方。她为我所做的每一个巧妙而精致的小举动，每一个友好的关注，简单的小事，相当家庭但又相当崇高，都揭示了比你们所有哲学教科书更深刻的对存在的理解。’

He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other ‘great-hearted creatures,’ and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to him.
尽管如此，他可能会提醒自己，他家里有很多像维尔迪兰家族一样简单的老朋友，他早年的同伴也同样热爱艺术，他认识其他“伟大的心肠生物”。 ”，然而，既然他投票支持简单、艺术和宽宏大量，他就完全不再看到它们了。但这些人并不认识奥黛特，如果他们认识她，也绝不会想到要把她介绍给他。

And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the ‘faithful’ who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife’s. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins’ hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some ‘bore’ or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society—doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard’s jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of ‘bores’ (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little ‘nucleus’) had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those ‘bores’ in the presence of the ‘faithful.’ But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort.
因此，在整个维尔迪兰圈子里，可能没有一个“忠实者”像斯旺那样爱他们，或者相信他爱他们。然而，当维尔迪兰先生说他对斯旺不满意时，他不仅表达了自己的情绪，而且无意中发现了他妻子的情绪。毫无疑问，斯万对奥黛特有着过于特殊的感情，以至于他未能接受奥黛特夫人。维尔迪兰每天都会向他倾诉心声；毫无疑问，他在利用维尔迪兰夫妇的热情好客时非常谨慎，常常出于他们从未怀疑过的原因而克制自己不去和他们一起吃饭，相反，他们只看到他担心自己不必与他们一起吃饭。拒绝去某些“无聊的人”或其他人家里的邀请；毫无疑问，尽管他采取了一切预防措施不让他们知道，但他们逐渐发现了他在社会上的辉煌地位——毫无疑问，所有这些事情都导致了他们对斯万的普遍不满。但真正的根本原因却截然不同。所发生的事情是，他们立刻在他身上发现了一扇锁着的门，一个保守的、难以进入的房间，他在里面仍然默默地自言自语，萨根公主并不怪诞，科塔尔的笑话并不好笑；但他的内心却充满了恐惧。总之（尽管他从未放弃对他们所有人的友好态度，或反抗他们的教条），他们发现不可能将这些教条强加给他，也不可能完全让他皈依他们的信仰，就像这样以前从未在任何人身上遇到过这种情况。 如果他同意公开放弃，为他们树立一个好榜样，他们就会原谅他去“无聊者”的房子（碰巧，在他的内心深处，他无限地喜欢维尔迪兰家族和他们所有的小“核心”）但他们很清楚，这是一种他们无法强求的誓言。

What a difference was there in a ‘newcomer’ whom Odette had asked them to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom they were building great hopes—the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a discovery which filled all the ‘faithful’ with amazement: the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the ‘swell,’ which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man’s pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,—whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins’ at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of Swann.
奥黛特要求他们邀请的“新来者”是多么不同啊，尽管她自己只见过他几次，而且他们对他寄予厚望——福什维尔伯爵！ （事实证明，他正是萨尼埃特的妹夫，这一发现让所有“信徒”都大吃一惊：这位老古文字学家的举止如此谦虚，以至于他们一直以为他是” ;当然，他永远不会梦想将维尔迪兰圆置于任何其他圆之上，就像斯旺现在所放置的那样。但他缺乏那种自然的优雅，这使得斯旺无法将自己与夫人的批评联系起来（太明显错误，不值得他注意）。维尔迪兰对他认识的人进行了攻击。至于画家有时沉溺于的粗俗和做作的长篇大论，科塔尔曾经冒险的推销员的寒暄，而斯万，他真诚地喜欢这两个人，可以很容易地为这些找到借口，而没有勇气或虚伪另一方面，福什维尔的智力水平使他对谩骂感到震惊和惊讶（完全不明白这一切是怎么回事），并且坦率地对其中的机智感到高兴。福什维尔出席维尔迪兰家的第一顿晚宴，就暴露了他们之间的所有差异，使他的品质开始凸显，并加速了斯旺的耻辱。

There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that curiosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies, earn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin’s, to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the ‘little clan’ what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar’s gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung.
在这次晚宴上，除了通常的聚会之外，还有一位来自索邦大学的教授，名叫布里肖，他见过M.和Mme。维尔迪兰在某个水源地，如果他在大学的职责和其他学术工作没有给他留下很少的空闲时间，他很乐意经常去拜访他们。因为他有那种好奇心，那种迷信的人生观，再加上对自己研究对象的一定程度的怀疑，对于有智慧的人来说，无论他们的职业如何，对于不相信医学的医生来说，对于他来说都是如此。不相信拉丁文练习的校长，以拥有宽广、才华横溢、确实卓越的头脑而闻名。当他在夫人那里时，他就受到了影响。维尔迪兰的，当他谈到哲学或历史时，从当时最热门的主题中选择他的插图，主要是因为他认为这些科学实际上只不过是为生活本身做准备，并想象他正在看到“小部落”将迄今为止他仅从书本上学到的知识付诸实践；也可能是因为，他在孩童时期就被灌输了这种观念，无意识地保留了对某些主题的崇敬感，因此，当他冒险以对话的方式谈论这些主题时，他认为自己正在抛弃学者的礼服。在他看来，这只是因为长袍的褶皱仍然粘在身上。

Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the ‘newcomer’s’ honour, had taken great pains with her toilet, observed to her: ‘Quite original, that white dress,’ the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a ‘de,’ and was on the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective ‘blanche’ and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out, ‘Blanche? Blanche of Castile?’ then, without moving his head, shot a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin.
晚宴刚开始，德福什维尔先生就坐在夫人的右边。韦尔迪兰以“新人”的荣誉，煞费苦心地整理了她的厕所，对她说：“那件白色裙子很原始，”医生的目光从未离开过他，他很好奇要知道他正在寻找一个吸引他注意的机会，以便与他有更密切的接触，在它的飞行中抓住了形容词“blanche”，他的眼睛仍然盯着他的盘子，厉声问道：“布兰奇？”卡斯蒂利亚的布兰奇？”然后，他头也不动，偷偷地向他的左右看了一眼，虽然有些怀疑，但总的来说还是很高兴。斯旺痛苦而徒劳地微笑着，证明他认为这个双关语很荒谬，而福什维尔则立即表明他能够欣赏其中的微妙之处，而且他是一个见多识广的人，通过保持在适当的范围内限制了一种让夫人着迷的自发性的欢笑。韦尔迪兰。

‘What are you to say of a scientist like that?’ she asked Forcheville. ‘You can’t talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?’ she went on, turning to the Doctor. ‘They must have some pretty lively times there, if that’s the case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!’
“你对这样的科学家有什么看法？”她问福什维尔。 “你不能连续认真地和他说话两分钟。你在医院里就是这么告诉他们的吗？”她转向医生继续说道。 “如果是这样的话，他们在那里一定度过了一段非常热闹的时光。我知道我必须作为病人被收治！

‘I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of Castile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?’ Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream.
“我想我听到博士谈到了那个邪恶的老骗子，卡斯蒂利亚的布兰奇，如果我可以这样表达的话。 “夫人，我说得对吗？”布里肖向夫人求助。维尔迪兰欣喜若狂，双目紧闭，把脸埋在两只手中，双手之间不时发出一声低沉的尖叫。

‘Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, sub rosa... I recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian—oh, how infinitely Athenian—Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes, indeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!’ he repeated in his ringing voice, which sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by M. Verdurin. ‘The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased.’
“天哪，夫人，如果这张桌子周围有这样的人，我不会梦想震惊那些虔诚的人……此外，我认识到，我们不可言喻的雅典共和国——哦，多么无限的雅典共和国是我们有能力向那个蒙昧主义的老女人卡佩致敬，我们的第一任警察局长。是的，确实如此，我亲爱的主人，是的，确实如此！”他用响亮的声音重复道，每个音节听起来都是一个单独的音符，以回应维尔迪兰先生的抗议。 “圣丹尼斯编年史及其信息的真实性是毋庸置疑的，让我们在这一点上毫无疑问。没有人比一位圣人的母亲更适合被世俗化的无产阶级选为赞助人，她让他看到了一些非常可疑的圣人，此外，正如苏格所说，还有其他伟大的圣伯纳犬。因为对她来说，你可以随心所欲。

‘Who is that gentleman?’ Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. ‘He seems to speak with great authority.’
“那位先生是谁？”福什维尔问夫人。韦尔迪兰。 “他说话似乎很有权威。”

‘What! Do you mean to say you don’t know the famous Brichot? Why, he’s celebrated all over Europe.’
'什么！你的意思是说你不认识著名的布里肖吗？为什么，他在整个欧洲都很受欢迎。

‘Oh, that’s Bréchot, is it?’ exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite caught the name. ‘You must tell me all about him”; he went on, fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. ‘It’s always interesting to meet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties here. No dull evenings in this house, I’m sure.’
“噢，那是布雷肖，是吗？”福什维尔惊呼道，他还没有听清楚这个名字。 “你必须告诉我关于他的一切”；他继续说道，用一双护目镜盯着这位名人。 “在晚餐时见到名人总是很有趣。但是，我想说，你要求我们在这里举办非常精选的聚会。我敢肯定，在这所房子里不会有沉闷的夜晚。”

‘Well, you know what it is really,’ said Mme. Verdurin modestly. ‘They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is nothing. I’ve seen him, don’t you know, when he’s been with me, simply dazzling; you’d want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else he’s not the same man, he’s not in the least witty, you have to drag the words out of him, he’s even boring.’
“好吧，你知道它到底是什么，”夫人说。维尔迪兰谦虚地说。 ‘他们在这里感到安全。他们可以谈论任何他们喜欢的事情，谈话就像烟花一样。布里肖，今晚，什么也不是。我见过他，你不知道吗，当他和我在一起的时候，简直令人眼花缭乱；你会想向他跪下。好吧，他和其他人不是同一个人，他一点也不机智，你必须从他嘴里拖出话来，他甚至很无聊。

‘That’s strange,’ remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment.
“这很奇怪，”福什维尔惊讶地说。

A sort of wit like Brichot’s would have been regarded as out-and-out stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence of the Professor’s vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything in Brichot’s pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme. Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette’s unaccountable idea to bring to the house. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked him on her arrival: ‘What do you think of my guest?’
像布里肖这样的机智，会被斯万早年生活在其中的人们认为是彻头彻尾的愚蠢，尽管它与真正的智力是相当相容的。教授充满活力、营养丰富的大脑的智慧很容易受到社会上许多在斯旺看来足够机智的人的嫉妒。但最后这些人已经如此彻底地向他灌输了他们的好恶，至少在与他们日常社会存在有关的一切方面，包括社会存在的附属部分，严格来说，属于智力领域，即谈话，斯旺认为在布里肖的寒暄中看不出任何东西；对他来说，他们只不过是迂腐、粗俗、粗俗到令人厌恶的地步。他也对这个习惯了礼貌的人感到震惊，这个学生无论对谁说话，都会采用粗鲁的、几乎是军营般的语气。最后，也许那天晚上，当他注视着夫人时，他失去了所有的耐心。维尔迪兰以不必要的热情欢迎了这个福什维尔的家伙，奥黛特把他带到家里来是不负责任的想法。斯万也在场，她感到有点尴尬，她一到就问他：“你觉得我的客人怎么样？”

And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good specimen of a man, had retorted: ‘Beastly!’ He had, certainly, no idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile’s mother, who, according to him, ‘had been with Henry Planta-genet for years before they were married,’ tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting ‘Isn’t that so, M. Swann?’ in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the ‘fear of God’ into a trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions.
他突然第一次意识到，他认识多年的福什维尔实际上可以吸引女人，而且是一个很好的男人典范，他反驳道：“太恶心了！”他当然不知道布里肖开始向他们讲述卡斯蒂利亚的布兰奇母亲的故事，据他说，“在他们之前，她已经和亨利·普兰塔热内在一起很多年了”。 “我们结婚了，”试图促使斯旺恳求他继续讲故事，他用军事口音插入“不是这样吗，斯旺先生？”为了让一名士兵具备“敬畏上帝”的精神，斯万简短地讲了自己的故事，这让女主人非常愤怒，他恳求原谅他对卡斯蒂利亚的布兰奇兴趣不大，因为他有件事想问画家。看来那天下午他是去参加另一位艺术家的作品展的，这位艺术家也是夫人的朋友。维尔迪兰最近去世了，斯旺希望从他那里知道（因为他重视自己的辨别能力），在他后来的作品中是否真的有比他早期展览中令人印象深刻的精湛技艺更多的东西。

‘From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call ‘elevated,’’ said Swann with a smile.
“从这个角度来看，它是非凡的，但在我看来，它并不是一种可以称之为‘高尚’的艺术形式，”斯旺微笑着说。

‘Elevated... to the height of an Institute!’ interrupted Cottard, raising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing.
“提升到……研究所的高度！”科塔尔打断道，假装严肃地举起了双臂。全桌哄堂大笑。

‘What did I tell you?’ said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. ‘It’s simply impossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes with a joke.’
“我告诉你什么了？”夫人说。维尔迪兰到福什维尔。 ‘要认真对待他根本不可能。当你最意想不到的时候，他会讲一个笑话。

But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend.
但她观察到斯旺，而且只有斯旺一个人，并没有放松下来。一方面，他对科塔尔不太满意，因为他在福什维尔面前嘲笑了他。但是画家并没有以斯旺可能感兴趣的方式回答，如果他们单独在一起，他可能会这样做，而是更愿意通过对已故朋友的才华发挥自己的智慧来轻松赢得其他人的钦佩。

‘I went up to one of them,’ he began, ‘just to see how it was done; I stuck my nose into it. Yes, I don’t think! Impossible to say whether it was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with leaven, with excrem...’
“我走到其中一个那里，”他开始说道，“只是想看看这是怎么做的；我把鼻子伸进去。是的，我不认为！无法说是用胶水、用肥皂、用封蜡、用阳光、用酵母、用粪便……”

‘And one make twelve!’ shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for no one saw the point of his interruption.
“一等于十二！”博士机智地喊道，但为时已晚，因为没有人明白他打断的意义。

‘It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,’ resumed the painter. ‘No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the ‘Night Watch,’ or the ‘Regents,’ and it’s even bigger work than either Rembrandt or Hals ever did. It’s all there,—and yet, no, I’ll take my oath it isn’t.’
“看起来好像什么也没完成，”画家继续说道。 “与《守夜人》或《摄政王》相比，没有更多的机会发现这个技巧，而且它比伦勃朗或哈尔斯的作品还要宏大。”一切都在那里——然而，不，我发誓事实并非如此。

Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: ‘It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you feel ticklish all over—and not the faintest clue to how it’s done. The man’s a sorcerer; the thing’s a conjuring-trick, it’s a miracle,’ bursting outright into laughter, ‘it’s dishonest!’ Then stopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, ‘And it’s so loyal!’
然后，就像歌手唱到最高音时，继续用假声哼唱余下的部分一样，他只能满足于一边低语，一边微笑，仿佛毕竟发生了一些令人无法抗拒的有趣的事情。这幅画的纯粹之美：“闻起来不错；”它让你头晕目眩；它让你屏住呼吸；你感觉浑身发痒，却丝毫不知道这是怎么回事。这个人是一个巫师；这东西是一个魔术，这是一个奇迹，”他突然大笑起来，“这是不诚实的！”然后停下来，庄严地抬起头，用低音提琴的音调调高音调，他努力使音调和谐，他总结道， “而且它是如此忠诚！”

Except at the moment when he had called it ‘bigger than the ‘Night Watch,’’ a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the ‘Night Watch’ as the supreme masterpiece of the universe (conjointly with the ‘Ninth’ and the ‘Samothrace’), and at the word ‘excrement,’ which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was ‘all right,’ before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter.
除了他称其为“比‘守夜人’更大”的那一刻，这种亵渎行为立即引起了夫人的抗议。维尔迪兰认为《夜巡》是宇宙的最高杰作（与《第九》和《萨莫色雷斯》并列），而“粪便”这个词让福什维尔扫了一眼桌子周围，看看这是否“好吧”，在他允许他的嘴唇弯成一本正经而安抚的微笑之前，所有的人（除了斯万）都把他们着迷和崇拜的眼睛固定在画家身上。

‘I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!’ cried Mme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was dining with them for the first time. ‘Hallo, you!’ she turned to her husband, ‘what’s the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great animal? You know, though, don’t you,’ she apologised for him to the painter, ‘that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without missing a word.’
“当他像那样升到空中时，我真是太爱他了！”夫人喊道。维尔迪兰一说完，就欣喜若狂，因为在福什维尔第一次和他们一起吃饭的那天晚上，餐桌上的谈话竟然如此有趣。 “哈喽，你！”她转向她的丈夫，“你怎么了，像只大动物一样目瞪口呆地坐在那里？不过你知道，不是吗？”她为他向画家道歉，“只要他愿意，他就能很好地说话；他可以说得很好。”任何人都会认为这是他第一次听你说话。如果你只是在说话时看到他就好了； “他只是把这一切都喝了。明天他会告诉我们你所说的一切，一个字也不会漏掉。”

‘No, really, I’m not joking!’ protested the painter, enchanted by the success of his speech. ‘You all look as if you thought I was pulling your legs, that it was just a trick. I’ll take you to see the show, and then you can say whether I’ve been exaggerating; I’ll bet you anything you like, you’ll come away more ‘up in the air’ than I am!’
“不，真的，我不是在开玩笑！”画家抗议道，他对自己演讲的成功感到着迷。 “你们看起来好像都认为我在开你们的玩笑，这只是一个把戏。我带你去看演出，然后你就可以说我是不是夸大其词了；我可以跟你打任何赌注，你会比我更加‘悬而未决’！”

‘But we don’t suppose for a moment that you’re exaggerating; we only want you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more sole, can’t you see his has got cold? We’re not in any hurry; you’re dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don’t serve the salad just yet.’
“但我们暂时不认为你在夸大其词；我们只想让你继续吃晚饭，还有我的丈夫。再给比什先生一些鞋底，你没看到他已经冷了吗？我们并不着急；你到处乱跑，就像房子着火了一样。等一下;现在先不要上沙拉。”

Mme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking, for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career. And so she did not allow the word ‘salad,’ which Mme. Verdurin had just uttered, to pass unchallenged.
女士。科塔尔是个害羞的女人，很少说话，尽管如此，当一个快乐的灵感把正确的词放进她嘴里时，她并不缺乏自信。她觉得这会很受欢迎；这个想法给了她信心，她所做的事情与其说是为了让自己发光，不如说是为了帮助她丈夫的事业。因此，她不允许使用“沙拉”这个词。维尔迪兰刚刚说了一句话，“毫无异议地通过”。

‘It’s not a Japanese salad, is it?’ she whispered, turning towards Odette.
“这不是日本沙拉，是吗？”她转向奥黛特低声说道。

And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it.
然后，在她对大仲马新的、非常成功的戏剧的巧妙和大胆的结合中所表现出的简洁和大胆的结合感到高兴和困惑时，她爆发出一种迷人的、少女般的笑声，不是声音很大，但又如此不可抗拒，过了好一会儿她才控制住。

‘Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,’ said Forcheville.
‘那个女士是谁？她看起来非常聪明，”福什维尔说。

‘No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday.’
'不它不是。但如果你们周五都来吃晚饭，我们会给你们准备一份。”

‘You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,’ said Mme. Cottard to Swann, ‘but, do you know, I haven’t been yet to this famous Francillon that everybody’s talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don’t see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he’s seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Théâtre-Français is never wasted, really; the acting’s so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,’ (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to ‘some friends of ours’ or ‘one of my friends,’ as being more ‘distinguished,’ speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) ‘who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I’m certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking—it’s only natural—about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one’s beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,’ she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. ‘I must admit, though, that it’s sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I’ve got a friend, now, who is most original, though she’s really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you’re to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I’m sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her next ‘day’; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh till we cried. I don’t know; perhaps it was the way she told it,’ Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave.
“您会认为我极其乡土，先生，”夫人说。科塔尔对斯旺说：“但是，你知道吗，我还没有去过大家都在谈论的著名的弗兰西永。医生一直在（我现在记得，他告诉我他和你在那里度过了一个非常愉快的夜晚），我必须承认，我认为花钱为他买座位没有多大意义。当他已经看过这部戏时，带我去吧。当然，在法国剧院度过一个晚上绝对不会浪费时间。表演总是那么好；但我们有一些非常好的朋友”（科塔尔夫人几乎从不说出正确的名字，而是将自己限制为“我们的一些朋友”或“我的一个朋友”，因为这样更“杰出”），用一种做作的语气说话。语气和一个人的重要性，只有当她选择时才需要提供名字）“他们经常有一个盒子，并且很友善地带我们去所有值得去的新作品，所以我确信迟早会见到这个弗朗西昂，然后我就会知道该怎么想。但我必须承认，我确实觉得自己很傻，因为无论何时我打电话到任何地方，我都会发现每个人都在谈论那份糟糕的日本沙拉——这是很自然的。真的，真的，人们已经开始有点厌倦听到这个话题了，”她继续说道，看到斯旺似乎对如此激烈的话题没有她希望的那么感兴趣。 “不过，我必须承认，他们开玩笑的方式有时很有趣：我现在有一个朋友，她是最有创意的，尽管她确实是一个美丽的女人，在社会上最受欢迎，到处都是，而且她告诉我，她让她的厨师做了一种日本沙拉，把年轻的杜马斯所说的所有东西都放进去，在剧中。 然后她只邀请了几个朋友来品尝。我很遗憾地说，我不是受青睐的少数人之一。但她在第二天就告诉了我们这一切；看来这很可怕，她让我们都笑到哭了。我不知道;也许这就是她所说的方式，’夫人。科塔尔看到斯万看上去仍然很严肃，疑惑地补充道。

And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by Francillon: ‘Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all. I don’t suppose it’s as good as the piece Mme. de Crécy worships, Serge Panine. There’s a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Théâtre-Français! Now, Serge Panine—! But then, it’s like everything that comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it’s so well written. I wonder if you know the Maître des Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine.’
而且，想象这也许是因为他没有被弗兰西永逗乐：“好吧，我敢说我毕竟会对此感到失望。”我认为它不如《Mme》那首曲子那么好。德·克雷西崇拜塞尔日·潘尼。如果你愿意的话，有一场戏；如此深刻，让人深思！但想在法国剧院的舞台上给一份沙拉收据吧！现在，塞尔吉·帕宁——！但是，就像所有出自 M. Georges Ohnet 笔下的作品一样，写得非常好。我想知道你是否认识 Maître des Forges，我比 Serge Panine 更喜欢他。

‘Pardon me,’ said Swann with polite irony, ‘but I can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces.’
“请原谅，”斯万礼貌地讽刺道，“但我可以向你保证，我对这些杰作的钦佩之情几乎是同等的。”

‘Really, now; that’s very interesting. And what don’t you like about them? Won’t you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he’s a little too sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.’
‘真的，现在；这很有趣。你不喜欢他们什么？你永远不会改变主意吗？也许你觉得他有点太悲伤了。好吧，好吧，我总是说，永远不要争论戏剧或小说。每个人都有自己看待事物的方式，对你来说可能可怕的事情也许正是我最喜欢的。

She was interrupted by Forcheville’s addressing Swann. What had happened was that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing Francillon, Forcheville had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the ‘little speech’ of the painter. ‘Your friend has such a flow of language, such a memory!’ he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill, ‘I’ve seldom seen anything like it. He’d make a first-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Bréchot you’ve drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I’m not so sure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn’t knock spots off the Professor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and all that; but that’s quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it’s not often I’ve seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, ‘hold the spittoon,’ as we used to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything you liked—I don’t know what—this glass, say; and he’d talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass; that’s a silly thing to say, I’m sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he’d tell you things you simply wouldn’t believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him.’
她被福什维尔对斯万的讲话打断了。发生的事情是这样的，而夫人。科塔尔正在讨论弗兰西永，福什维尔一直在向夫人表达。维尔迪兰对画家的“小言辞”表示钦佩。 “你的朋友语言如此流畅，记忆力如此之好！”当画家停下来时，他对她说，“我很少见过这样的东西。”他会成为一流的传道人。天啊，我希望我也能像那样。今晚你和他以及布雷肖先生一起抽到了两个幸运号码？尽管我不太确定，仅仅作为一名演讲者，这位演讲者不会让教授黯然失色。这对他来说更加自然，不像是在读书。当然，从他的叙述方式来看，他确实使用了一些有点现实的词语，等等；但这就是现在的情况。无论如何，我很少看到一个人像我们在团里常说的那样巧妙地握住地板，“拿着痰盂”，顺便说一句，我们有一个人，他让我想起了。你可以拿任何你喜欢的东西——我不知道是什么——比如这个玻璃杯；他会滔滔不绝地谈论这件事好几个小时；不，不是这个玻璃杯；抱歉，这么说是很愚蠢的；但稍微大一点的事情，比如滑铁卢战役，或者类似的事情，他会告诉你一些你根本不相信的事情。哎呀，斯旺当时就在团里；他一定认识他。

‘Do you see much of M. Swann?’ asked Mme. Verdurin.
“你经常见到斯万先生吗？”夫人问。韦尔迪兰。

‘Oh dear, no!’ he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: ‘Isn’t that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?—But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Trémoïlles, with the Laumes and all that lot!’ The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins’. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these ‘bores,’ especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the ‘faithful,’ was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Trémoïlles, with whom Swann was always ‘shut up,’ had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor’s design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Trémoïlles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other ‘bores’ upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn’t do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a ‘collidor’!
“哦，天哪，不！”他回答道，然后，他想，如果他让斯旺感到愉快，他可能会赢得奥黛特的青睐，于是他决定利用这个机会来奉承他，谈论他的时尚朋友，但以一个男人的身份说话他以一种善意批评的语气，对这个世界进行了自我评价，而不像是在祝贺斯旺获得了不应得的好运：“不是这样吗，斯旺？我从来没有见过你，不是吗？——但是，到底在哪里可以见到他呢？这个生物把所有的时间都花在了拉特雷莫伊勒一家、洛姆一家以及所有这些人身上！”这种指责在任何时候都是错误的，而且现在斯万已经放弃了至少一年的时间，这一点就更是如此了。除了维尔迪兰家之外，几乎所有的房子都去。但是，只要维尔迪兰一家不认识的家庭的名字，他们就会以责备的沉默接受。维尔迪兰先生担心提及这些“令人厌烦”的事，尤其是当着所有“忠实信徒”的面，以这种不圆滑的方式向她提起时，必然会给他的妻子留下痛苦的印象，他偷偷地看了一眼她，本能地带着焦急的关怀。然后他看到，她坚决不予理睬，完全逃避与刚刚传达给她的消息的接触，不仅保持沉默，而且也充耳不闻，就像我们假装的那样。一位朋友错误地试图在谈话中塞入一些借口，而我们应该表现出接受的借口，如果我们似乎没有抗议地听到了它，或者当有人说出敌人的名字时，只要提到敌人在我们面前是被禁止的；女士。 维尔迪兰让她的沉默看起来不是同意，而是无生命物体所保持的无意识的沉默，突然间，她的脸上失去了所有的生命力和所有的流动性。她圆圆的前额现在什么也不是了，不过是一幅精美的高浮雕作品，而斯万总是“闭嘴”的那些拉特雷穆伊勒的名字却未能穿透它。她的鼻子因皱眉而明显皱起，暴露在外，可以看到两个黑暗的空洞，这无疑是根据生活建模的。你可能会说，她半张着的嘴唇正要说话。然而，这一切只不过是一个蜡铸件、一个石膏面具、雕塑家设计的一座纪念碑、一尊将在工业宫展出的半身像，公众肯定会聚集在它面前，惊叹不已。看看雕塑家如何表达维尔迪兰家族无可争议的尊严，而不是拉特雷莫伊勒家族或洛梅家族的尊严，他们是平等的（如果不是，确实是更好的），以及所有其他“无聊者”的平等和更好在地球表面上，他成功地将其石头的洁白和坚硬赋予了几乎教皇般的威严。但大理石终于变得活跃起来，让人明白，如果一个人去那所房子，一点也不感到拘谨，因为女人总是喝醉了，而丈夫则如此没有受过教育，以至于他将走廊称为“碰撞机” ！

‘You’d need to pay me a lot of money before I’d let any of that lot set foot inside my house,’ Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on Swann.
“在我让这些人踏入我的房子之前，你需要付给我很多钱，”夫人说。维尔迪兰总结道，居高临下地俯视着斯旺。

She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist’s aunt, who at once exclaimed: ‘To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them; I’m sure I should be afraid; one can’t be too careful. How can people be so common as to go running after them?’
她几乎没想到他会如此彻底地屈服，以呼应钢琴家姨妈的神圣单纯，她立刻惊呼道：“现在想想吧！”让我惊讶的是，他们可以让任何人靠近他们；我确信我应该害怕；小心一点都不过分。怎么会有普通人去追他们呢？

But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: ‘Gad, she’s a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,’ which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, ‘And a lot of good may it do them!’ Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one’s opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the ‘other side’), he broke in:
但他至少可以像福什维尔那样回答：“天啊，她是一位公爵夫人；”仍然有很多人对这种事情印象深刻，”这至少允许夫人。维尔迪兰最后反驳道：“这对他们有很多好处！”斯万没有笑，只是笑了笑，他的态度很清楚地表明，他当然不能认真对待这样一个荒谬的建议。维尔迪兰先生仍然偷偷地、断断续续地瞥了一眼他的妻子，他遗憾地看到，也非常明白，她现在正被大审判官的激情所点燃，而她却无法成功地消灭异端邪说。因此，为了让斯万收回自己的观点（因为在“另一方”眼中，勇敢地提出自己的观点总是一种精于算计的怯懦），他插话道：

‘Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan’t repeat it to them, you may be sure.’
‘现在，坦白地告诉我们，你自己对他们的看法。你可以肯定，我们不会向他们重复这件事。

To which Swann answered: ‘Why, I’m not in the least afraid of the Duchess (if it is of the La Trémoïlles that you’re speaking). I can assure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don’t go so far as to say that she’s at all ‘deep’—‘ he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth—‘but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people.’
斯旺回答道：“哎呀，我一点也不害怕公爵夫人（如果你说的是拉特雷莫伊勒家族的话）。”我可以向你保证，每个人都喜欢去看她。我并没有说她‘深沉’——”他发音这个词的时候似乎意味着什么可笑的东西，因为他的讲话保留了某些心理习惯的痕迹，这些习惯是他最近生活中的变化，一种复兴。他对音乐的热情表明了这一点，使他暂时放弃了，因此有时他实际上会相当热情地表达自己的观点——“但当我说她很聪明时，我是很真诚的，而她的丈夫确实是一个书呆子。”他们是很有魅力的人。

His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her ‘little nucleus’ from ever attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her tortured heart, ‘You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not say so to us.’
他的解释非常有效。女士。维尔迪兰现在意识到，这种不相信的状态会阻止她的“小核心”达成完全一致，她无法克制自己，对这个可怜虫的固执感到愤怒，因为她看不到他的话给她带来了多么痛苦。 ”，却从她饱受折磨的内心深处大声喊道：“如果你愿意的话，你可以这么想，但至少你不用对我们这么说。

‘It all depends upon what you call intelligence.’ Forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant. ‘Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by intelligence.’
“这完全取决于你所谓的智力。”福什维尔觉得现在轮到他表现出色了。 “现在，斯旺，告诉我们你所说的智力是什么意思。”

‘There,’ cried Odette, ‘that’s one of the big things I beg him to tell me about, and he never will.’
“好了，”奥黛特喊道，“这是我恳求他告诉我的一件大事，但他永远不会。”

‘Oh, but...’ protested Swann.
“哦，但是……”斯旺抗议道。

‘Oh, but nonsense!’ said Odette.
“噢，胡说八道！”奥黛特说。

‘A water-butt?’ asked the Doctor.
“水屁股？”医生问。

‘To you,’ pursued Forcheville, ‘does intelligence mean what they call clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into society?’
“对你来说，”福什维尔继续说道，“智力是否意味着他们所说的聪明的谈话？你知道，那些混入社会的人吗？

‘Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!’ said Mme. Verdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped eating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, ‘It doesn’t matter; take your time about it; there’s no hurry; I only reminded you because of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.’
“吃完你的甜点，这样他们就可以把你的盘子拿走！”夫人说。维尔迪兰酸溜溜地对萨尼埃特说，萨尼埃特陷入沉思，已经停止了进食。然后，也许对她的粗鲁感到有点羞愧，“没关系；没关系；”慢慢来；不着急；我只是因为其他人才提醒你，你知道；它让仆人们退缩。

‘There is,’ began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, ‘a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist Fénelon...’
“有，”布里肖开始说道，每个音节都带有响亮的声音，“那位令人愉快的老无政府主义者费内隆对智力有一个相当奇怪的定义……”

‘Just listen to this!’ Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor. ‘He’s going to give us Fénelon’s definition of intelligence. That’s interesting. It’s not often you get a chance of hearing that!’
“听听这个！”维尔迪兰召集了福什维尔和博士。 “他将为我们提供费内隆对智力的定义。那很有意思。你很少有机会听到这样的话！

But Brichot was keeping Fénelon’s definition until Swann should have given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville.
但布里肖一直保留费内隆的定义，直到斯万给出自己的定义。斯万保持沉默，而且，由于这种新的畏惧行为，破坏了夫人的辩证法的辉煌比赛。维尔迪兰很高兴能够向福什维尔提供报价。

‘You see, it’s just the same as with me!’ Odette was peevish. ‘I’m not at all sorry to see that I’m not the only one he doesn’t find quite up to his level.’
“你看，这和我的情况一样！”奥黛特很生气。 “看到我不是他唯一一个达不到他水平的人，我一点也不感到遗憾。”

‘These de La Trémouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired,’ inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, ‘are they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob, Sévigné, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for ‘copy.’ And, in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Trémouaille, kept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign politics.’
“这些德拉特雷穆瓦耶夫人。维尔迪兰向我们展示的一切都不尽如人意，”布里肖问道，有力地阐明，“他们是否是那对夫妇的后裔，那位可敬的老势利小人塞维涅说她很高兴认识这对夫妇，因为它是如此对她的农民有好处吗？确实，侯爵夫人还有另一个原因，就她而言，这可能是第一位的，因为她本质上是一名彻底的记者，并且总是在寻找“副本”。而且，在她过去定期寄给她的日记中女儿，是夫人。德拉特雷穆瓦耶通过她所有的重要关系掌握着对外政治的消息灵通。

‘Oh dear, no. I’m quite sure they aren’t the same family,’ said Mme. Verdurin desperately.
‘噢，亲爱的，不。我很确定他们不是同一个家庭，”夫人说。维尔迪兰绝望地说道。

Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Trémoïlle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke’s culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins’ always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, ‘All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that’s not a crime, I hope,’ that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject ‘Se non è vero,’ but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out.
自从他把未动过的盘子交给管家后，萨尼埃特就再次陷入了沉默的沉思，终于出现了，带着紧张的笑声，向他们讲述了他曾经如何与拉特雷莫伊尔公爵共进晚餐的故事，关键是公爵不知道乔治·桑是一个女人的笔名。斯旺非常喜欢萨尼埃特，他觉得有必要向他提供一些说明公爵文化的事实，这将证明他的这种无知实际上是不可能的；但他突然停住了。当他说话时，他意识到萨尼埃特不需要证据，但他已经知道这个故事是不真实的，原因很简单，因为他当时发明了它。韦尔迪兰一家总是觉得这个可敬的人很迟钝，这让他深受煎熬。由于他意识到今晚比平常更加忧郁，他决定在晚餐结束之前至少成功地搞笑一次。他很快就投降了，看着自己的城堡变成废墟，显得如此悲惨，并以如此胆怯的语气回答斯万，恳求他不要坚持已经多余的反驳，“好吧；好吧，我们去吧。”好的;无论如何，即使我犯了一个错误，但我希望这不是犯罪。”斯旺渴望能够通过坚称这个故事无疑是真实的、极其有趣来安慰他。一直在听的博士觉得现在是插入“Se non è vero”的最佳时机，但他不太确定这句话，而且害怕被揭穿。

After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. ‘She can’t have been at all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she’s a woman you can really talk to; that’s all I want. Of course she’s getting a bit broad in the beam. But Mme. de Crécy! There’s a little woman who knows what’s what, all right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she’s got the American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Crécy,’ he explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. ‘I should say that, as a specimen of the female form—‘
晚饭后，福什维尔走向医生。 “她长得一点也不难看，夫人。维尔迪兰；不管怎样，她是一个你可以真正交谈的女人；这就是我想要的。当然，她的光束有点宽了。但是女士。克雷西！有一个小女人知道什么是什么，好吧。根据我的说法和灵魂，你一眼就能看出她有美国人的眼光，那个女孩也有。我们正在谈论Mme。德·克雷西，”他解释道，维尔迪兰先生也加入了他们，嘴里叼着烟斗。 “我应该说，作为女性形态的样本——”

‘I’d rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!’ the words came tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion, inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol, different from his wife’s, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was ‘shaking with laughter’ than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a different way.
“我宁愿把它放在床上，也不愿听到雷声！”科塔尔从嘴里吐出这句话，他已经等了好一阵子了，直到福什维尔停下来喘口气，这样他就可以开始讲他那个古老的笑话了。他担心，如果谈话转向不同的方向，这个机会可能不会再出现了；他现在以一种过度的自发性和自信来演奏它，人们经常会注意到这种表现是为了掩盖冷漠和轻微的情绪波动，这与准备好的背诵密不可分。福什维尔知道并看到了这个笑话，并且被彻底逗乐了。至于维尔迪兰先生，他毫不吝惜自己的欢乐，因为最近发现了一种用符号来表达欢乐的方式，这种方式与他妻子的不同，但同样简单明了。他刚开始像一个“笑得发抖”的人一样移动头部和肩膀，他就开始咳嗽，好像因为笑得太厉害，吞下了烟斗里的一口烟。通过将烟斗牢牢地含在嘴里，他可以无限期地延长窒息和欢闹的哑剧。所以他和夫人。维尔迪兰（在房间的另一边，画家正在给她讲故事，她闭上眼睛，准备把脸埋进手中）就像剧院里的两个面具，每个面具都代表喜剧，但方式不同。

M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: ‘I must just go and see the Duc d’Aumale for a minute,’ so drolly, that M. Verdurin’s cough began all over again.
维尔迪兰先生比他想象的更聪明，没有把烟斗从嘴里拿出来，因为科塔尔有机会离开房间一会儿，低声说了一句诙谐的委婉语，这是他最近学会的，现在每当他必须去的时候都会重复这句话。那个地方说：“我必须去见一下奥马勒公爵。”语气如此滑稽，维尔迪兰先生又开始咳嗽了。

‘Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can’t you see, you’ll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,’ counselled Mme. Verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs.
‘现在，把你嘴里的烟斗拿出来；难道你看不出来吗，如果你试图像那样压抑你的笑声，你会窒息的。”维尔迪兰，她端着一盘利口酒走过来。

‘What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!’ declared Forcheville to Mme. Ccttard. ‘Thank you, thank you, an old soldier like me can never say ‘No’ to a drink.’
‘你的丈夫是一个多么令人愉快的人啊； “他有十几个人的智慧！”福什维尔向夫人宣称。克塔德。 “谢谢你，谢谢你，像我这样的老战士永远不会对喝酒说‘不’。”

‘M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,’ M. Verdurin told his wife.
'M。德福什维尔认为奥黛特很迷人，”维尔迪兰先生告诉他的妻子。

‘Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon. We must arrange it, but don’t on any account let Swann hear about it. He spoils everything, don’t you know. I don’t mean to say that you’re not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very often. Now that the warm weather’s coming, we’re going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can. That won’t bore you, will it, a quiet little dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite delightful. ...
“为什么，你知道吗，她非常希望有一天能在午餐时再次见到你。我们必须安排一下，但无论如何不要让斯旺知道。他毁了一切，你不知道吗？当然，我并不是说你不能来吃晚饭。我们希望经常见到您。现在天气暖和了，我们会尽可能在户外吃晚饭。偶尔在森林里吃一顿安静的小晚餐，不会让你感到无聊，不是吗？太棒了，太棒了，那将是非常令人愉快的。 ...

‘Aren’t you going to do any work this evening, I say?’ she screamed suddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying, before a ‘newcomer’ of Forcheville’s importance, at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the ‘faithful.’
“我说，你今天晚上不打算做任何工作吗？”她突然对小钢琴家尖叫，她看到了一个机会，可以在福什维尔的重要性的“新人”面前立即展示她始终如一的智慧和她的专横权力。 “忠实的”。

‘M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,’ Mme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he, still following up the idea of Forcheville’s noble birth, which had obsessed him all through dinner, began again with: ‘I am treating a Baroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren’t there some Putbuses in the Crusades? Anyhow they’ve got a lake in Pomerania that’s ten times the size of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she’s a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.’
'M。德·福什维尔夫人只是想说一些关于你的可怕的话。”当她的丈夫重新出现在房间里时，科塔尔警告了他。他仍然在思考福什维尔出身高贵的想法，这个想法在整个晚餐过程中一直困扰着他，他又开始说道：“我刚才正在招待一位男爵夫人，普特布斯男爵夫人;十字军东征中不是有一些普特布斯吗？不管怎样，他们在波美拉尼亚有一个湖，它的大小是协和广场的十倍。我正在治疗她的干性关节炎；她是一个迷人的女人。女士。我相信维尔迪兰也认识她。

Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: ‘He’s an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors.’
过了一会儿，福什维尔发现自己和夫人单独在一起。科塔尔对她的丈夫做出了有利的评价：“他也是一个有趣的人；他是一个有趣的人。”你可以看出他认识一些好人。哎呀！但他们会了解很多事情，那些医生。”

‘D’you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?’ asked the pianist.
“你想让我为斯旺先生弹奏奏鸣曲中的乐句吗？”钢琴家问道。

‘What the devil’s that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!’ shouted M. de Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: ‘No, no. The word isn’t serpent-à-sonates, it’s serpent-à-sonnettes!’ he explained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant.
‘那是什么鬼？我希望不是奏鸣曲蛇！”德福什维尔先生喊道，希望能产生效果。但科塔德博士从来没有听过这个双关语，他没有抓住重点，以为德福什维尔先生犯了一个错误。他大胆地冲过去纠正：“不，不。”这个词不是“serpent-à-sonates”，而是“serpent-à-sonnettes”！”他用一种充满热情、不耐烦和得意的语气解释道。

Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed.
福什维尔向他解释了这个笑话。医生脸红了。

‘You’ll admit it’s not bad, eh, Doctor?’
“你会承认这还不错，嗯，医生？”

‘Oh! I’ve known it for ages.’
'哦！我很久以前就知道了。

Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it—and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley—the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville.
然后他们就沉默了。小提琴声部挥动的颤音预示着小提琴声部的波动，形成了一个比它高出两个八度的声音卫士——就像在山区一样，在看似静止的垂直下落的洪流的衬托下，人们可以在两百英尺以下的地方分辨出，一个在山谷中行走的女人的微小身影——这个小短语刚刚出现，遥远但优雅，受到其透明的、不断的、铿锵有力的窗帘的长期、逐渐展开的保护。斯万在内心深处转向它，对它说话，就像对他的爱情秘密的知己一样，就像对奥黛特的一个朋友一样，他会向他保证，他不需要注意这个福什维尔。

‘Ah! you’ve come too late!’ Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the ‘faithful,’ whose invitation had been only ‘to look in after dinner,’ ‘we’ve been having a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But he’s gone. Isn’t that so, M. Swann? I believe it’s the first time you’ve met him,’ she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann owed the introduction. ‘Isn’t that so; wasn’t he delicious, our Brichot?’
'啊！你来得太晚了！’女士。维尔迪兰向一位“忠实信徒”打招呼，他的邀请只是“晚饭后来看望”，“我们享受到了无与伦比的布里肖！”你从来没有听过这样的雄辩！但他已经走了。是不是这样，斯旺先生？我相信这是你第一次见到他，”她继续说道，并强调了这样一个事实：斯旺应该归功于她的介绍。 ‘不是这样吗？我们的布里肖，他不是很美味吗？

Swann bowed politely.
斯旺礼貌地鞠了一躬。

‘No? You weren’t interested?’ she asked dryly.
'不？你不感兴趣吗？”她干巴巴地问。

‘Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow.’
“哦，但我向你保证，我非常着迷。对我来说，他也许有点太专横、太快活了。我希望看到他有时少一点自信，多一点宽容，但让人感觉他懂得很多，总的来说，他看起来是一个很健全的人。

The party broke up very late. Cottard’s first words to his wife were: ‘I have rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.’
聚会很晚才散去。科塔尔对妻子说的第一句话是：“我很少见到科塔尔夫人。”维尔迪兰的状态就像她今晚一样。

‘What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?’ said Forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a ‘lift.’ Odette watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he asked whether he might come in, replied, ‘I suppose so,’ with an impatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her husband: ‘Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Trémoïlle?’
‘你的夫人到底是什么？维尔迪兰？有点坏帽子，嗯？”福什维尔对画家说，他提议“搭车”。奥黛特遗憾地看着他离开。她不敢拒绝让斯万送她回家，但她在马车上情绪低落，烦躁不安，当他问他是否可以进来时，她回答说：“我想可以。”她不耐烦地耸了耸肩。当他们都走了之后，夫人。维尔迪兰对她的丈夫说：“你有没有注意到，当我们谈到斯万夫人时，斯旺的笑声是多么愚蠢的笑声。”拉特雷莫伊尔？

She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the particle ‘de’ before that lady’s name. Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively ‘the de La Trémoïlles,’ or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the ‘captions’ beneath caricatures, who elide the ‘de’), ‘the d’La Trémoïlles,’ but she corrected herself at once to ‘Madame La Trémoïlle.—The Duchess, as Swann calls her,’ she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd.
她不止一次地提到斯旺和福什维尔如何抑制那位女士名字前的助词“de”。她毫不怀疑这是故意的，为了表明他们不惧怕头衔，她决定模仿他们的傲慢，但不太明白应该采取什么语法形式。此外，她言语中天生的腐败克服了她顽固的共和主义，她仍然本能地说“de La Trémoïlles”，或者更确切地说（通过音乐厅歌手和漫画下方“标题”作者的使用而神圣化的缩写） ”，她省略了“de”），“d'La Trémoïlles”，但她立即纠正自己为“La Trémoïlle夫人。”——公爵夫人，斯旺这样称呼她，”她讽刺地补充道，脸上的微笑证明了她只是引用，她本人对如此幼稚和荒谬的分类不承担任何责任。

‘I don’t mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.’
“我不介意说我认为他非常愚蠢。”

M. Verdurin took it up. ‘He’s not sincere. He’s a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He’s always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don’t. Not like the other fellow, who’s never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don’t blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he’s always Comte de Forcheville!’ he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort.
维尔迪兰先生接手了这件事。 ‘他并不真诚。他是一位狡猾的顾客，总是在一边和另一边之间徘徊。他总是试图与野兔一起奔跑，与猎犬一起狩猎。他和福什维尔之间有多么不同啊。至少，在那里，你有一个直接告诉你他的想法的人。你要么同意他的观点，要么不同意。不像另一个人，他从来都不是不伦不类的人。顺便说一句，你有没有注意到，奥黛特似乎全力以赴地支持福什维尔，我也不怪她。毕竟，如果斯万试图成为超越我们的时尚男人，成为苦恼的公爵夫人的冠军，那么无论如何，另一个男人已经获得了一个头衔；他是一个真正的男人。 “他永远是福什维尔伯爵！”他小心翼翼地从嘴里说出这句话，仿佛他熟悉这一尊严历史的每一页，正在对它的价值（相对于其他同类）进行一丝不苟、准确的估计。

‘I don’t mind saying,’ Mme. Verdurin went on, ‘that he saw fit to utter some most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a way of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the dear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he’s going away.’
“我不介意说，”夫人。维尔迪兰接着说，“他认为有必要对布里肖发表一些最恶毒、最荒谬的影射。”当然，一旦他看到布里肖在这所房子里很受欢迎，他就会反击我们，破坏我们的聚会。我认识他这种人，他是家里亲爱的好朋友，当他离开时，他在楼梯上把你们都拉成了碎片。

‘Didn’t I say so?’ retorted her husband. ‘He’s simply a failure; a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that’s at all big.’
“我不是说过了吗？”她丈夫反驳道。 ‘他简直就是个失败者；一个可怜的小可怜虫，一生都对任何伟大的事情都嫉妒得发疯。”

Had the truth been known, there was not one of the ‘faithful’ who was not infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with little sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of reserve on Swann’s part, undraped in any such conventional formula as ‘Of course, I don’t want to say anything—‘ to which he would have scorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least ‘freedom of speech’ is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs.
如果真相大白，那么所有“忠实者”中没有一个不比斯旺更加恶毒。但其他人都会采取预防措施，用明显的寒暄来缓和他们的恶意，很少有情感和真诚的火花。斯旺方面表现得最轻微的保留，没有任何像“当然，我不想说什么——”这样的传统套话，他会对此嗤之以鼻，但在他们看来，这就是故意的背叛行为。有一些原创的、杰出的作家，他们哪怕一点点“言论自由”都会被认为是令人反感的，因为他们一开始就不是为了迎合公众的品味，并为公众提供所使用的常见表达方式；正是通过同样的过程，斯旺激怒了维尔迪兰先生。在他的例子中，就像在他们的例子中一样，正是他的语言的新颖性导致他的听众怀疑他的设计的黑暗性。

Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins’, and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love.
斯万仍然没有意识到维尔迪兰家中威胁他的耻辱，并继续以最乐观的眼光，通过爱的钦佩之眼来看待他们所有的荒谬。

As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist’s or a jeweller’s window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to the Rue La pérouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious, always, that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins’, might even—for all he knew—if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase, when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed.
一般来说，除了晚上，他不会与奥黛特约会。他担心如果他白天也去看她，她会厌倦他。与此同时，即使只有一个小时，他也不愿意放弃自己在她心中的地位，因此不断寻找机会引起她的注意，以任何不会令她不快的方式。如果在花店或珠宝商的橱窗里，一株植物或一件装饰品引起了他的注意，他会立即想到将它们送给奥黛特，想象着他也会本能地感受到偶然看到它们给他带来的愉悦，会增加她对自己的感情；他会命令立即将他们带到拉佩鲁斯街，以便加速这一时刻，当她收到他的奉献时，他可能会感到自己在某种意义上被带到了她的面前。他总是特别焦急地希望她在晚上出去之前收到这些礼物，这样当他到达维尔迪兰家时，她对他的感激之情可能会给她带来额外的温柔，甚至可能——尽管他这样做了。知道——如果店主赶紧的话，请在晚餐前给他带来一封她写的信，或者她本人亲自到他家门口，来一次特别的拜访，表示感谢。就像在早期阶段一样，当他对她的性格进行了愤怒和蔑视的反射行为实验时，他现在试图通过满足的反射行为从她身上引出她从未透露过的亲密感情的新鲜颗粒。

Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, ‘It’s your position that attracts her,’ or at this stage, ‘It’s your money that she’s really in love with,’ he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette’s love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes—as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed.
她常常因为缺钱而感到尴尬，迫于债主的压力，就会向他寻求帮助。他喜欢这样，就像他喜欢一切能让奥黛特印象深刻的东西一样，他对自己的爱，或者仅仅是他的影响力，以及她可能对他的利用程度。或许，如果有人一开始对他说，“是你的职位吸引了她”，或者在这个阶段，“她真正爱上的是你的钱”，他不会相信这个建议，也不会相信。想到人们认为她依附于他，人们认为他们是通过势利或财富等具有约束力的纽带联系在一起的，他感到非常痛苦。但即使他接受了这种可能性，当他发现奥黛特对他的爱是建立在比单纯的感情或她可能在他身上发现的任何吸引人的品质更持久的基础上时，也可能不会给他带来任何痛苦；因为他知道奥黛特对他的爱是建立在比单纯的感情更持久的基础上的，或者她可能在他身上发现的任何吸引人的品质。基于健全的商业利益；这种兴趣将永远推迟她可能想结束他们关系的致命日子。目前，当他向她赠送大量礼物，并提供各种服务时，他可以依靠他本人或他的智力所没有的优势，可以放弃无休止的、致命的努力来使自己有吸引力。 而这种作为情人、仅凭爱而生活的快乐、对他倾向于怀疑的现实的快乐，从长远来看，作为非物质感觉的业余爱好者，他必须为此付出的代价，增强了他的幸福感。他眼中的价值——就像人们看到那些怀疑大海的景色和海浪的声音是否真的令人愉快的人，当他们相信自己是这样的，以及罕见的品质和绝对超然于自己的品味时，我们同意每天支付几英镑在旅馆的房间里，在那里可以欣赏到那种景象和那种声音。

One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a ‘kept’ woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the ‘kept’ woman—an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels—with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother’s face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;—the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by ‘keeping’ a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of ‘keeping’ could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of ‘kept’ woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure.
有一天，当他想起这个命令时，他再次想起有人对他说奥黛特是一个“被包养”的女人，当时他再次以对比那个奇怪的女人而自娱自乐。拟人化，这个“被保留”的女人——一种未知和恶魔般的品质的虹彩混合物，就像古斯塔夫·莫罗的一些幻想中那样，绣有滴着毒药的花朵，与珍贵的珠宝交织在一起——与奥黛特的脸上他看着她的经过对受难者的怜悯、对不公正行为的怨恨、对善意行为的感激之情，这些都是他早年在自己母亲和朋友的脸上看到的；那个奥黛特，他的谈话经常转向他自己比任何人都了解的事情，他的收藏，他的房间，他的老仆人，他的银行家，他保存着他所有的产权契约和债券；——银行家的想法提醒了我他必须尽快拜访他，以取一些钱。事实上，如果在这个月里，他对奥黛特经济困难的援助不如上个月那么慷慨，当时他给了她五千法郎，如果他克制住了不给她一条钻石项链她所渴望的，他会让她对他的慷慨的钦佩和让他如此高兴的感激之情消失，甚至冒着让她想象他对她的爱的风险（当她看到它的可见表现越来越少时）本身就减少了。 然后，他突然问自己，这是否不正是“保留”一个女人所暗示的含义（事实上，“保留”这个概念似乎可以源自于一点也不神秘也不反常的元素，而是属于他日常生活中的亲密例行公事，比如那张千法郎的钞票，一种熟悉的家用物品，有一些地方被撕破，并用胶纸修补，他的男仆在付完家庭帐目和房租后，把它锁在抽屉里在旧写字台上，他从那里提取了它，并与另外四个人一起发送给奥黛特）以及是否不可能向奥黛特申请，因为他认识她（因为他从来没有想过她会永远以前从别人那里拿过一分钱），这个“被保留的”女人的头衔，他认为完全不适用于她。他无法进一步探索这个想法，因为他的精神昏睡突然出现，这种精神昏睡对他来说是先天的、间歇性的和天意的，就在那一刻，他大脑中的每一个光粒子都熄灭了，就像在瞬间一样。后来，当到处都安装了电灯时，只需用手拨动开关，就可以切断房屋的所有照明。他的思绪在黑暗中摸索了一会儿，他摘下眼镜，擦了擦眼镜，用手捂住眼睛，但没有看到任何光亮，直到他发现自己面对着一个完全不同的想法，意识到他下个月，我必须尽力给奥黛特寄六七千法郎而不是五法郎，只是为了给她一个惊喜，让她高兴。

In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet Odette at the Verdurins’, or rather at one of the open-air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard—to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected—for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (“straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left’) as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually ‘at the ball’ when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils—a new experience, this,—as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins’, and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from Méséglise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener’s skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and rose.
晚上，当他待在家里，直到到维尔迪兰家，或者更确切地说，在他们喜欢在布瓦特别是圣克劳德经常光顾的一家露天餐馆与奥黛特见面时，他就会去一家时髦的餐厅吃饭，他曾经是那里的常客。他不想与那些据他所知可能对奥黛特有用的人失去联系，同时也多亏了他们，他才能为她争取到一些特权或快乐。此外，他已经习惯了上流社会的优雅和舒适，在蔑视的同时，也逐渐产生了对它的迫切需要，结果是，当他达到了这样的地步时，在他看来，最简陋的住所与最豪华的宅邸完全一样，他的感官已经完全习惯了后者，以至于他一进入前者就会感到强烈的不适。 对于那些邀请他在他们的公寓里跳舞的收入微薄的小家庭，他也有同样的尊重——达到了他们永远不会怀疑的程度（“直接上楼到五楼，门在左边”）至于帕尔马公主，她举办了巴黎最华丽的派对；但当他发现自己和一家人的父亲们聚集在女主人的卧室里时，他并没有真正“参加舞会”的感觉，洗手台上铺满了毛巾，床变成了衣帽间，床罩上堆满了帽子和大衣，这给他带来了同样令人窒息的感觉，就像现在那些习惯了半辈子电灯的人从冒烟的灯或煤气灯中得到的感觉一样。需要熄灭的蜡烛。如果他外出就餐，他会在七点半叫车；当他换衣服的时候，他会一直想念奥黛特，这样他就不会孤单，因为对奥黛特的不断思念赋予他与她分离的时刻与那些时刻一样的奇特魅力。她就在他身边。他会钻进马车，开走，但他知道这个念头跟着他跳了出来，落在了他的膝盖上，就像一只宠物，他可以带到任何地方，并在餐桌上随身携带，不被其他客人注意到。他会抚摸、抚摸它，用它温暖自己，当一种倦怠的感觉席卷他时，他会做出轻微的颤抖动作，收缩他的喉咙和鼻孔——这是一种新的体验——当他系紧那束东西时哥伦拜恩在他的扣眼里。 一段时间以来，他一直感觉既不舒服也不高兴，特别是自从奥黛特把福什维尔带到维尔迪兰家后，他很想离开一段时间，到乡下休息。但当奥黛特在那里时，他永远鼓不起勇气离开巴黎，哪怕是一天。天气暖和；这是春天最美好的时光。尽管他开车穿过一座石头城市，把自己关在一座没有草也没有花园的房子里，但他眼前不断出现的是他拥有的一个公园，位于贡布雷附近，下午四点，在到达之前，他的眼前一直是他拥有的一个公园。芦笋苗床，得益于从梅塞格利兹吹过田野的微风，无论是在花园里的角树凉亭下，还是在池塘边，他都可以享受到芬芳的凉爽空气，周围环绕着勿忘我- 不是和虹膜；当他坐下来吃晚饭时，经过园丁熟练的手训练和缠绕，他的桌子上到处都是醋栗丛和玫瑰。

After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly—especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the ‘faithful’ before their normal time—that on one occasion the Princesse des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the Bois) observed:
晚饭后，如果他在布瓦或圣克劳德有一个提前的约会，他会突然从餐桌上起身离开家——尤其是如果有下雨的危险，这样就会在正常时间之前驱散“信徒”——有一次，德洛梅斯公主（在她家吃晚饭太晚了，斯万在咖啡送来之前就离开了，去布瓦岛上的维尔迪兰家族）观察到：

‘Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us all as a joke.’
“说实话，如果斯万年长三十岁，而且患有糖尿病，他这样逃跑也许还有理由。”他似乎把我们所有人当作一个笑话。”

He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette’s presence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature.
他说服自己，他无法去贡布雷享受春天的魅力，但至少可以在天鹅河或圣克劳德找到春天的魅力。但由于他心里只想着奥黛特，所以回家时，他不知道自己是否尝到了新叶的芬芳，也不知道月光是否已照耀。他会受到餐厅钢琴在花园里演奏的奏鸣曲中的小乐句的欢迎。如果花园里没有钢琴，维尔迪兰夫妇就会煞费苦心地从私人房间或餐厅里搬出一架钢琴；并不是因为斯旺现在重新受到青睐；而是因为斯旺现在重新受到青睐。离得很远。但是，为某人（甚至是他们不喜欢的人）安排一种巧妙的娱乐形式的想法会在准备过程中激发他们短暂的亲切感和感情。他时不时地提醒自己，又一个美好的春夜即将结束，他会强迫自己注意树木和天空。但是，奥黛特的出现总是让他陷入兴奋状态，加上他已经有一段时间几乎没有离开的发烧病痛，剥夺了他那种安静和舒适的感觉，而这种感觉是印象中不可或缺的背景。我们源自自然。

One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual banquet of an old comrades’ association, Odette had at once exclaimed across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the ‘faithful,’ in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:
一天晚上，当斯万同意和维尔迪兰一家一起吃饭，并在晚餐时提到他必须参加第二天的老同志协会的年度宴会时，奥黛特立刻在桌子对面当着所有人的面大声喊道。 ，在福什维尔面前，他现在是“忠实者”之一，在画家面前，在科塔尔面前：

‘Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha’n’t see you, then, till I get home; don’t be too late.’
“是的，我知道，明天你有宴会；那我回家之前就见不到你了；别太晚了。

And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette’s demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the ‘faithful,’ he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the ‘faithful’; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy.
虽然斯万还没有对奥黛特对其中一个或另一个“忠实者”表现出的友谊感到生气，一点也不认真，但当他听到她在所有人面前以那种平静的不谦虚的方式承认这一事实时，他感到一种极大的高兴。他们每天晚上定期见面，他在她家里的特权地位，以及这暗示着她对他的偏爱。确实，斯万经常反思奥黛特绝不是一个了不起的女人。他对一个明显比他低等的生物拥有至高无上的权力，当他听到向所有“忠实的”人宣布这一点时，并没有什么特别让他感到高兴的。但自从他发现，除了他之外，在其他几个男人看来，奥黛特似乎是一个令人着迷、令人向往的女人，她的身体对他的吸引力激起了他一种痛苦的渴望，想要绝对控制她的内心，哪怕是最微小的部分。他开始对晚上在她家里度过的那些时刻赋予了不可估量的价值，当他把她抱在膝盖上，让她告诉他她对这件事或那件事的想法时，他将这一宝贵的财富视为唯一的财富。他仍然紧握着他所有的尘世财产。因此，在这顿晚餐之后，他把她拉到一边，小心翼翼地热情地感谢她，试图通过他感激的程度向她表明她有能力给予他的快乐的相应强度，这是至高无上的快乐。只要他的爱持续下去，并且他仍然脆弱，就可以保证他免受嫉妒的攻击。

When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it.
第二天晚上，当他结束宴会时，天正下着倾盆大雨，他除了胜利之外一无所有。一位朋友提出用一辆封闭的马车带他回家，奥黛特邀请他来，并向他保证她不会等其他人，他可以带着平静的心情和平静的心情回家。心，没有在雨中出发，而是回家睡觉了。但也许，如果她发现他似乎没有坚持每天晚上无一例外地和她在一起的决心，她可能会变得粗心，而不能只为他保留一个他特别渴望的晚上。

It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep.
当他到达她家门口时，已是十一点多了，当他为没能早点离开而道歉时，她抱怨说确实很晚了；暴风雨使她身体不适，头疼，她警告他，不会让他停留超过半小时，半夜时她会送他走。过了一会儿，她觉得累了，想睡觉。

‘No cattleya, then, to-night?’ he asked, ‘and I’ve been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya.’
“那么，今晚没有卡特兰吗？”他问道，“我一直期待着一株漂亮的小卡特兰。”

But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: ‘No, dear, no cattleya tonight. Can’t you see, I’m not well?’
但她毫无反应；紧张地说：“不，亲爱的，今晚没有卡特兰。”你没看到吗，我身体不太好？

‘It might have done you good, but I won’t bother you.’
“这可能对你有好处，但我不会打扰你。”

She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its message: ‘She is there—expecting you,’ and now tortured him with: ‘She is there with the man she was expecting.’ He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger.
她恳求他在走之前把灯灭掉。他拉上她床边的窗帘，然后离开了她。但是，当他再次回到自己的房子时，他突然想到，也许奥黛特那天晚上正在等别人，她只是假装很累，她让他把灯关掉只是为了让他知道。他应该认为她要睡觉了，他一离开家，她就又把门点着了，并为今晚要作客的陌生人重新打开了门。他看着他的手表。他离开她已经过去了大约一个半小时。他出去，打了一辆出租车，把车停在她家附近，在一条与另一条街成直角的小街上，那条街位于她家的后面，他有时会沿着那条街去敲门。在她卧室的窗户上，让她让他进来。他离开了出租车；街道上空无一人，漆黑一片。他走了几码，几乎就在她家对面出来了。在所有一排窗户闪烁着微光的黑暗中，其中的灯光早已熄灭，他看到一扇，只有一扇，从百叶窗的板条之间溢出，像压酒机一样关闭在它神秘的地方。金色的汁液，充满整个房间的光，在许多个夜晚，当他拐进街道时，当他在远处看到它时，这盏灯就用它的信息让他的心欢欣鼓舞：“她在那里——期待着”你，”现在又折磨他说：“她和她所期待的那个男人在一起。”他必须知道是谁；他蹑手蹑脚地沿着墙走，直到到达窗户，但在百叶窗倾斜的栅栏之间，他什么也看不见。在寂静的夜里，他只能听到窃窃私语的声音。 当他看着那道光，在金色的气氛中移动，在紧闭的腰带后面，那看不见的、令人厌恶的一对时，当他听那低语声时，他遭受了多么痛苦，那低语声揭示了那个在他离开后悄悄溜进来的人的存在，奥黛特的背信弃义，以及她此刻与陌生人一起品尝的快乐。

And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost itg uncertainty, now that Odette’s other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago—though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette—now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette—Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a woman’s daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth.
然而他并不为自己的到来感到遗憾；迫使他离开自己家的痛苦，当它失去了不确定性时，也失去了它的尖锐性，现在，奥黛特的另一种生活，他在第一时刻突然无助的怀疑，肯定在那里，几乎在他的内心深处。在他眼前，在灯光的照耀下，抓住并关押了一个不知情的囚犯，在那个房间里，当他愿意时，他可以强行闯入，出其不意地抓住它。或者更确切地说，他会敲击百叶窗，就像他很晚才到那里时经常做的那样，通过这个信号，奥黛特至少会知道他知道，他已经看到了光，也听到了声音;而他自己，刚才还想象着她在嘲笑他，与另一个人分享他被欺骗的事实，而现在是他看到了他们，对他们的错误充满信心和坚持，被欺骗和陷入困境不是别人，正是他本人，他们相信他在一英里之外，但他本人就在那里，有一个计划，知道他将在另一分钟内去敲击百叶窗。也许，在那一刻他所感受到的（几乎是一种愉快的感觉）不仅仅是疑虑的解决、痛苦的舒缓；而是更多的东西。是一种智力上的乐趣。 如果说，自从他坠入爱河以来，一切都恢复了一些很久以前对他的微妙吸引力——尽管只有当一个想法、奥黛特的记忆照亮它们时——现在它是另一个奥黛特在年轻时勤奋好学的日子里表现出的才能，是奥黛特在新的生活中所激发的，对真理的热情，但对真理的热情也介于他和他的情妇之间，只从她那里接受光亮，她是一个私人的人。奥黛特的唯一对象（一种无限珍贵的对象，而且其绝对美几乎是非个人的）是奥黛特——奥黛特的活动、她的环境、她的计划和她的过去。在他生命中的其他时期，另一个人的日常小言小举对斯旺来说总是显得毫无价值。如果有人向他重复谈论这些事情，他会认为这无关紧要，而当他听的时候，他感兴趣的只是他心灵中最底层、最普通的部分。在这种时刻，他感到极其迟钝、毫无灵感。但在爱情的这个奇怪阶段，另一个人的个性变得如此扩大、如此深入，以至于他现在可以感觉到自己内心被唤起好奇心，想要了解一个女人日常活动的最细微的细节，就像他对知识的渴望一样。他曾经学过历史。 还有各种各样的行为，直到现在，他都会羞愧地退缩，比如今晚，在窗外，明天，就他所知，进行间谍活动，向不经意的证人提出巧妙的挑衅性问题，贿赂仆人现在，在他看来，在门口聆听，与破译手稿、权衡证据、解释古老纪念碑完全处于同一水平，也就是说，有许多不同的科学研究方法，每一种方法都有具有明确的智力价值，并且可以合法地用于探索真理。

As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one’s impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt—which he so desperately wanted to feel—that he had over them, lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man’s voice—he strained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette’s friends as he knew, the voice could be—asked:
当他的手悄悄伸向百叶窗时，一想到奥黛特现在知道他怀疑了她，他回来了，他把自己贴在她的窗外，他感到一阵羞愧。她经常告诉他，她对嫉妒的男人和暗中监视的恋人感到多么恐惧。他要做的事情将是极其尴尬的，她会永远憎恨他，而现在，暂时，只要他不敲门，也许即使是不忠的行为，她仍然爱他。人们常常不耐烦地坚持立即满足，从而牺牲了未来幸福的前景。但他对真相的渴望比对她的渴望更强烈，对他来说似乎更高尚。他知道，某些事件的真实故事，他愿意献出自己的生命，以便能够准确而完整地重建这些故事，他可以在那扇带有光条的窗户里阅读，就像在一个发光的金色木板上阅读一样。这些珍贵的手稿，其中蕴藏着丰富的艺术瑰宝，查阅这些手稿的学者不能不为之感动。他渴望了解真相所带来的满足感，真相在那份简短、转瞬即逝、珍贵的记录中，在半透明的纸页上，如此温暖、如此美丽，让他如此激动。此外，他所感受到的——他非常渴望感受到的——他对他们的优势，也许不在于知道，而在于能够向他们表明他知道。他踮起脚尖。他敲门。他们没有听到；他又敲了敲门；更响亮；他们的谈话停止了。一个男人的声音——他竖起耳朵，想在他认识的奥黛特朋友中辨别出这个声音是谁的——问道：

‘Who’s that?’
'那是谁？'

He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible, too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty, welcoming tone:
他无法确定这个声音。他又敲了敲门。先是窗户，然后百叶窗被打开。现在退休已经太晚了，而且她必须知道一切，以免显得太轻蔑、太嫉妒和好奇，他用一种漫不经心、热情、欢迎的语气喊道：

‘Please don’t bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light. I wanted to know if you were feeling better.’
‘请别打扰；我只是碰巧路过，看到了光。我想知道你是否感觉好些了。

He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette’s company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann’s mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold.
他抬起头来。两位老先生站在他对面的窗户里，其中一位手里拿着一盏灯。他可以看到他们之外的房间，一个他以前从未见过的房间。当他迟到奥黛特时，他养成了这样的习惯，即通过事实来识别她的窗户，因为这是一排窗户中唯一仍然亮着灯的窗户，否则都一样，这一次，他被灯光误导了，并且她敲了敲她家隔壁房子的窗户。他尽可能地道歉，然后匆匆回家，欣喜若狂，因为他的好奇心的满足使他们的爱情完好无损，而且，在奥黛特的陪伴下，他假装了这么长时间，表现出一种冷漠，但现在，他已经不再表现出冷漠的态度了。嫉妒，给她证明了他自己的激情过剩，在一对恋人中，这种激情最终完全免除了接受者足够爱对方的义务。他从未对她提起过这次不幸的遭遇，他自己甚至不再去想这件事。但时不时地，他的思绪在漫游的过程中会遇到这段未被察觉的记忆，将其惊醒，将其更深入地推入他的意识中，让他感到一阵尖锐的、根深蒂固的疼痛。仿佛这是一种身体上的疼痛，斯万的心灵却无力减轻。然而，就身体疼痛而言，由于它独立于心，心可以专注于它，可以注意到它已经减少，它已经暂时停止了。但伴随着这种精神上的痛苦，头脑仅仅通过回忆它，就重新创造了它。决定不去想它，就等于仍然想它，仍然受它的苦。 当他在与朋友交谈时忘记了自己的痛苦时，突然随口说出的一句话就会让他脸色​​大变，就像一个受伤的人被一只笨手笨脚的手触碰他酸痛的四肢时一样。当他离开奥黛特时，他很高兴，他感到平静，他想起了她对他谈论这个或那个男人时带着温柔的嘲讽的微笑，那是对他自己充满温柔的微笑；他想起了她头的重力，她似乎把头从轴心上抬起来，让它下垂，落在他的嘴唇上，就像她在马车上的第一个晚上所做的那样，仿佛违背了她的意愿。她依偎在他的怀里，用疲倦的眼神看着他，低着头的头似乎退到了肩膀之间，仿佛因寒冷而退缩。

But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,—with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another —of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber.
但随后，他的嫉妒，就像他爱情的影子一样，立刻给他带来了补充，与那天晚上她迎接他的新微笑相反，现在，反常的是，当她向另一个人表达爱意时，她正在嘲笑斯万——她低下头，但现在低下头落在别人的嘴唇上，以及（但给予了一个陌生人）她向他表达过的所有爱意的标记。正如人们可能会说的那样，他从她的房子里带走的所有这些美好的记忆不过是那么多的草图、粗略的计划，就像设计师向一个人提交的装饰方案的轮廓，使斯旺能够形成各种想法。她有能力为别人采取热情的态度，或燃烧或微弱。结果，他开始后悔在她的陪伴下尝到的每一种快乐，每一种他发明的新爱抚（而且很不谨慎地向她指出那是多么令人愉快），每一种他在她身上发现的新鲜魅力，因为他知道，一会儿之后，他们就会去丰富他的秘密酷刑室里收藏的工具。

A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette’s eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins’. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette’s tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: ‘That’s finished him off, or I’m very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,’ that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: ‘He need only have made himself pleasant and he’d have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time.’
当斯万想起几天前他第一次在奥黛特眼中看到的突然表情时，螺丝又重新转动起来。那是在维尔迪兰家吃过晚饭后。是否是因为福什维尔意识到他的妹夫萨尼埃特不喜欢他们，决定嘲笑他，以他为代价来炫耀，或者因为他被一些尴尬的言论惹恼了萨尼埃特对他说了这句话，尽管其他人没有注意到这句话，他们对其中可能隐藏的任何不礼貌的暗示一无所知，或者可能是因为他一段时间以来一直在寻找确保被逐出房子的机会福什维尔对萨尼埃特的无礼言论作出了这样的回应：他是一位对他太了解的客人，而且他心地善良，有时他自己也会因为他在房间里而感到尴尬。一连串的辱骂，不遗余力地侮辱他，由于恐惧，痛苦，受害人的恳求，他变得更加大胆，他喊得越大声，这个可怜的生物在询问了夫人之后。维尔迪兰没有得到任何答复，他是否应该留下来，他结结巴巴地离开了房子，眼里含着泪水。奥黛特面无表情地看着这一幕。但当萨尼埃特身后的门关上时，她就用几根钉子强迫自己脸上正常的表情垂下来，从而使自己达到与福什维尔相同的粗俗程度。她的眼睛里闪烁着恶意的微笑，对他的大胆表示祝贺，对这个可怜的受害者表示讽刺和同情。她用一种同谋的眼神看着他，这明显地暗示着：“他完了，不然我就大错特错了。” 你看到他看起来多么傻吗？他实际上在哭，”福什维尔当他的目光与她的目光相遇时，立刻从愤怒中清醒过来，或者说是假装愤怒，他仍然满脸通红，微笑着解释道：“他只需要让自己变得愉快，他就可以了。”还在这里；任何时候，善意的责骂对一个人都没有什么坏处。’

One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. ‘At any rate, this is true,’ she said to herself; ‘that’s always something to the good; he may make inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won’t be this, anyhow, that will give me away.’ But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere.
有一天，斯万下午一早就出门去拜访，却没有找到他想见的人在家，他突然想到要在一个小时去奥黛特那里，尽管他那时他通常不会去她家，他知道她总是在家里休息或写信，直到下午茶时间，如果不打扰她的话，他会很高兴见到她一会儿。门房告诉他，他相信奥黛特在里面。斯万按响了门铃，以为自己听到了声音，听到了脚步声，但没有人到门口。他又焦急又恼火，绕到她家后面的另一条小街上，站在她卧室的窗下。窗帘拉上了，他什么也看不见。他大声敲着窗玻璃，大声喊道；仍然没有人来。他发现邻居们都在盯着他看。他转过身去，心想，毕竟，他可能错误地认为自己听到了脚步声；但他并没有这么做。但他仍然全神贯注于怀疑，无法将注意力转向其他事情。等了一个小时后，他回来了。他在家里找到了她；她告诉他，当他按铃时，她正在屋里，但已经睡着了。铃声把她吵醒了；她猜想一定是斯万，就跑出去迎接他，但他已经走了。她当然听到了他敲窗户的声音。斯万立刻就能在这个故事中发现那些字面真相的片段之一，骗子们在受到意外打击时，会通过将他们必须发明的谎言引入其中来安慰自己，认为它可以安全地融入其中，并会借给他们。整个故事栩栩如生。 确实，当奥黛特刚刚做了一些她不愿意透露的事情时，她会煞费苦心地把它藏在心里的某个秘密的地方。但一旦她发现自己面对着那个她不得不撒谎的男人，她就变得不安，她所有的想法都像火焰中的蜡一样融化，她的创造力和推理能力都瘫痪了，她可能会搜查自己的大脑，但只会发现一片空白；尽管如此，她还是必须说点什么，而她想要隐瞒的事实就在她力所能及的范围之内，而事实是，这是唯一剩下的事情。她从上面撕下一小段，本身并不重要，她向自己保证，这毕竟是最好的做法，因为它是事实的细节，因此比谎言更危险。 “无论如何，这是真的，”她对自己说。 “这总是好事；他可以作出查询；他会发现这是真的；无论如何，这不会出卖我。”但她错了；她错了。正是这件事出卖了她；她没有考虑到，事实的这一片断细节具有锋利的边缘，除了与她任意分离的那些连续的事实片段外，这些边缘无法适应，无论其中有什么虚构的细节，这些边缘都无法适应。她可以把它嵌入其中，通过它们重叠的角度和她忘记填补的间隙，将继续表明它的正确位置在别处。

‘She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was myself, that she wanted to see me,’ Swann thought to himself. ‘But that doesn’t correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.’
“她承认她听到我按门铃，然后敲门，她知道是我自己，她想见我，”斯万心里想。 “但这与她不让我进去的事实并不相符。”

He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;—what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o’clock, when he had called,—a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette’s daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of which—supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one’s intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one’s disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members—is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for good cooking.
然而，他并没有让她注意这种前后矛盾，因为他认为，如果让奥黛特独自一人，也许会编造一些谎言，让他隐约看出真相；但他并没有提醒她注意这一点。她说话了；他没有打断她，而是怀着热切而悲伤的虔诚，收集着从她嘴里说出的话，感觉（而且正确地感觉，因为她说话时隐藏着真相），就像一层面纱一样。在圣所里，他们留下了模糊的印记，勾勒出那无限珍贵的、可惜的是，无法发现的真相的微弱轮廓；——那天下午，三点钟，当他打电话来时，她一直在做什么——他所讲述的真相除了这些伪造的、难以辨认的神圣痕迹外，它永远不会拥有更多的东西，而这种真理从此只存在于这个生物的秘密记忆中，他会在完全不知道其价值的情况下沉思它，但永远不会把它交给他。确实，他时不时地强烈怀疑奥黛特的日常活动本身并不那么有趣，而且她可能与其他男人建立的这种关系并不自然地在普遍意义上存在，或者对于每个人来说都是如此。理性的存在，一种病态的忧郁精神，能够感染发烧或煽动自杀。他意识到，在这样的时刻，那种兴趣、那种忧郁，只存在于他身上，就像一种疾病可能存在一样，而一旦他的疾病治愈了，奥黛特的行为，她可能给予的亲吻，就会变成一种疾病。再次像无数其他女性一样无害。 但是，斯万现在研究它们的痛苦好奇心只源于他自己，这一意识并不足以让他决定认为这种好奇心很重要，并采取一切可能的措施来满足它，这是不合理的。事实上，斯旺已经到了这样一个时代，他的哲学——就他而言，得到了当时流行哲学的支持，也得到了他度过了大半生的圈子的支持，这个圈子围绕着他。在《洛姆公主》中，人们认为，一个人的智力会随着一个人对一切事物的怀疑程度而增加，除了每个成员的个人品味之外，没有什么真实的和无可争议的东西被发现——不再是年轻人的，而是一种积极的、几乎是一种医学哲学，这种哲学是人们的哲学，他们不将自己的愿望固定在外部物体上，而是努力从已经花费的岁月的积累中分离出他们可以认为是特有的和永久的习惯和激情的明确残留物，他们首先会刻意安排，确保他们选择的生活方式不会被证明是不和谐的。 斯万认为，明智的做法是在生活中考虑到他因不知道奥黛特所做的事情而遭受的痛苦，就像他考虑到潮湿的气候总是导致他的湿疹一样。在他的预算中预计要花费相当大的一笔费用来获取有关奥黛特日常工作的信息，缺乏这些信息会使他不高兴，就像他为满足其他品味保留了一定的余地一样，他知道这些信息快乐是意料之中的（至少在他坠入爱河之前），比如他对收集东西的品味，或者对烹饪的品味。

When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept on saying: ‘What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you.’ He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the Trimavera.’ She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing.
当他提出告别奥黛特回家时，她恳求他再多呆一会儿，甚至强行扣留了他，在他开门要走的时候抓住了他的手臂。但他没有考虑到这一点，因为，在构成谈话的众多手势、演讲和其他小事件中，我们不可避免地会忽略那些隐藏着某种秘密的东西（没有注意到任何引起我们兴趣的东西）。我们的怀疑盲目地寻找真理，而我们却停下来审视其他事物，而这些事物背后并没有隐藏任何东西。她不断地说：“真是太可惜了！” “你从来没有机会在下午来过，而你一旦来了，我就会想念你。”他很清楚，她还没有足够爱他，以至于仅仅因为错过了他的来访而感到如此痛苦，但她是一个心地善良的女人，渴望给他带来快乐，当她做了任何惹恼他的事情时，他常常感到抱歉，他发现她在这种情况下感到抱歉是很自然的，因为她剥夺了他的快乐。和她在一起度过一个小时，这真是一种极大的乐趣，即使不是她自己，至少对他来说也是如此。尽管如此，这件事实在是太不重要了，以至于她那无法缓解的悲伤神情最终开始让他感到困惑。她比平时更让他想起《特里马维拉》画家笔下的一些女人的面孔。”在那一刻，她脸上露出了她们沮丧、心碎的表情，似乎随时准备屈服于沉重的负担之下。当他们只是让婴儿耶稣玩石榴，或者看着摩西把水倒进槽里时，悲伤就难以承受。同样的悲伤，他曾经在她脸上见过一次，但什么时候，他已经说不出来了。 然后，他突然想起来了；奥黛特在向夫人道歉时撒了谎。维尔迪兰那天晚上，晚餐结束后，她借口生病而没有参加，但实际上是为了能单独和斯旺在一起。当然，即使她是最谨慎的女人，她也不会为如此无辜的谎言感到悔恨。但奥黛特通常所说的谎言并不那么无辜，目的是为了防止被发现，否则她可能会与她的一位或另一位朋友陷入最可怕的困境。因此，当她撒谎时，她充满恐惧，感觉自己的防御能力微弱，对成功没有信心，她会因为精疲力尽而哭泣，就像孩子们有时在没有睡觉时哭泣一样。她还知道，通常来说，她的谎言会对她所讲的那个男人造成严重伤害，而且如果她讲得不好，她可能会发现自己受到他的摆布。因此，在他面前，她立刻感到卑微和有罪。当她不得不说出一个微不足道的社会谎言时，它所带来的危险联想以及它所唤起的记忆，会让她感到虚弱、疲惫感和悔罪感，并意识到自己做了错事。

What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann’s benefit, to give her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair.
她现在为了斯旺的利益编造了什么样的令人沮丧的谎言，让她露出痛苦的表情，哀伤的声音，在她强迫自己做出的努力和恳求宽恕的努力下，声音似乎变得动摇了？他有一个想法，她试图向他隐瞒的不仅仅是那天下午发生的事情的真相，而是更直接的事情，可能是尚未发生的事情，但现在随时可能发生，并且当它发生时，将揭示早期的事件。就在这时，他听到前门的铃声响起。奥黛特一直在说话，但她的话逐渐变成了含糊不清的呻吟。她对那天下午没有见到斯万、没有给他开门感到遗憾，这种遗憾已经融入了普遍的绝望之中。

He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as though some one were going away—probably the person whom Swann must on no account meet—after being told that Odette was not at home. And then, when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and murmured: ‘Poor darling!’ When finally he left her, she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. ‘If I saw what was in this,’ he argued, ‘I should know what she calls him, what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don’t look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter is posted.’
他听见大门关上的声音，还有马车的声音，仿佛有人在被告知奥黛特不在家后就要离开——很可能是斯万绝对不能见到的人。然后，当他想到，仅仅在他不习惯的时间来，他就扰乱了许多她不希望他知道的安排，他有一种沮丧的感觉。 ，几乎，苦恼。但自从他爱上了奥黛特，既然他习惯于把所有的心思都转向她，他可能对自己产生的怜悯，他只对她感到同情，并低声说：“可怜的亲爱的！”他离开了她，她拿起桌上的几封信，问他是否愿意帮她寄出去。他走到邮局，从口袋里掏出信件，在将每封信放入信箱之前，扫描了地址。除了最后一个是福什维尔以外，所有这些都是商人的。他把它握在手里。 “如果我看到里面的内容，”他争辩道，“我应该知道她怎么称呼他，她对他说了什么，他们之间是否真的有什么关系。”或许，如果我不向内看，我就会对奥黛特缺乏温柔，因为只有这样我才能摆脱怀疑，这种怀疑也许是对她的诽谤，无论如何，这一定会引起她的注意。痛苦，一旦这封信寄出，这种痛苦就永远不可能平息。

He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper, to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If, instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to read.
他离开邮局回家了，但他把最后一封信留在了口袋里。他点燃了一支蜡烛，把他不敢打开的信封靠近火焰。起初他什么也看不出来，但信封很薄，把它压在里面的硬卡片上，他就能透过透明的纸读到最后的话。这是一个冷酷正式的签名。如果不是福什维尔本人在看一封写给福什维尔的信，而是福什维尔读了一封写给斯万的信，他可能会在信中找到另一种更加温柔的语言！他牢牢地握住卡片，卡片来回滑动，信封太大，无法容纳，然后用手指和拇指移动它，在信封上有纸张的部分下方划出一行又一行。没有加倍，仅通过它就可以阅读。

In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette’s uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line ‘I was right,’ but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: ‘I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.’ To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard.
尽管采取了所有这些策略，他还是无法弄清楚。但这并不重要，因为他已经看到了足够多的内容，足以让自己确信这封信是关于一些无关紧要的琐事，与爱情毫无关系；但是，这并不重要。这与奥黛特的叔叔有关。斯万在这行的开头读得很清楚“我是对的”，但不明白奥黛特的做法是对的，直到突然出现了一个他起初无法解读的词，使整个句子变得易于理解：“我打开门是对的；”是我叔叔。’开门！当斯旺按响门铃时，福什维尔就在那里，她把他打发走了。这就是斯旺听到的声音。

After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: ‘Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.’ To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once, why have said, ‘I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.’ Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the visits that Odette had received about five o’clock, and could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann’s affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette’s life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o’clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without.
然后他读了整封信；最后，她为自己对待福什维尔如此不客气的行为而道歉，并提醒他，他把烟盒留在了她家，这正是斯旺第一次来访后她写给斯旺的信。但她对斯旺补充道：“你为什么不忘记你的心呢？”我绝对不应该让你把它拿回来。”对福什维尔来说，绝对不是这样的事。没有暗示他们之间有任何阴谋。事实上，他不得不承认，在这一切中，福什维尔所受到的待遇比他自己更糟糕，因为奥黛特写信给他，让他相信她的来访者是他的叔叔。由此可见，他，斯旺，是她所重视的男人，也是为了他，她才把另一个人送走的。然而，如果奥黛特和福什维尔之间没有任何关系，为什么不立即打开门，为什么说：“我打开门是对的；我打开门是对的，我打开门是对的。”是我叔叔。’对吧？如果她当时没有做错什么，福什维尔怎么可能解释她没有开门呢？斯旺一动不动地站在那里，心碎、困惑，但又很高兴。看着奥黛特毫无顾忌地递给他的这个信封，她对他的荣誉是那么绝对的信任；透过它的透明窗户，他看到了奥黛特生活的一个片段，以及他曾绝望地了解的一个事件的秘密历史，就像通过切入其表面的一个狭窄的、发光的切口看到的那样在她不知情的情况下。然后，他的嫉妒心为这一发现而欣喜若狂，仿佛这种嫉妒心有一个独立的存在，极其自私，贪婪地贪图一切能补充其活力的东西，甚至不惜牺牲斯旺本人。 现在它已经储备了食物，斯旺每天晚上都会因为奥黛特五点左右的来访而开始感到不安，并且可以设法找出福什维尔当时在哪里。因为斯万对奥黛特的感情仍然保留着从一开始就强加给她的形式，因为他对她度过一生的职业一无所知，而且精神上的昏睡使他无法用想象力来补充这种无知。起初，他并不是嫉妒奥黛特的一生，而是嫉妒那些他可能误解的事件使他认为奥黛特可能欺骗了他的时刻。他的嫉妒就像一只章鱼，先伸出第一条触手，然后是第二条，最后是第三条触手，先是牢牢地固定在那个时刻，下午五点钟，然后又固定在另一个时刻，然后又固定在另一个时刻。但斯旺无法发明他的痛苦。它们只是记忆，是外来痛苦的延续。

>From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann’s character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible.
>然而，从外部来看，一切都给他带来了新的痛苦。他决定将奥黛特与福什维尔分开，带她去南方几天。但他想象酒店里的每个男性都对她觊觎，而她也对他们觊觎回报。所以，昔日旅行时总要寻找新的人和人多的地方的他，现在可能会被视为野蛮地逃离人类社会，仿佛人类社会对他造成了残酷的伤害。当他在每个男人身上都看到了奥黛特的潜在情人时，他怎么可能不变成厌世者呢？因此，他的嫉妒甚至比他最初对奥黛特产生的快乐、热情的渴望更能改变斯万的性格，在世人的眼中，甚至彻底改变了这个性格的外在迹象。

A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette’s letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party.
斯旺截获并读了奥黛特写给福什维尔的信的那天晚上，一个月后，他去参加了维尔迪兰夫妇在布瓦举办的晚宴。当聚会散去时，他注意到夫人之间进行了一系列低声讨论。维尔迪兰和她的几位客人，以为他听到钢琴家被提醒第二天来参加查图的聚会；现在他，斯旺，没有被邀请参加任何聚会。

The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: ‘There must be no lights of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to see by.’
维尔迪兰夫妇只是低声说话，用语含糊其辞，但画家也许不假思索地大声喊道：“绝对不能有任何灯光，他必须在黑暗中演奏月光奏鸣曲，以便我们通过灯光看到。” .'

Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence, an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:
女士。维尔迪兰看到斯万就在听得见的范围内，他认为这种表达的双重愿望是让说话者保持安静，并保持自己在听者眼中的纯真外表，在一种强烈的空虚中被中和。其中，聪明共谋的坚定迹象被天真的微笑所覆盖，这是任何一个注意到错误的人都会采取的表达方式，因此，如果不是那些犯下错误的人，至少是那些犯下错误的人，其严重性就会立即暴露出来。这件事不应该在他的耳边说出来。奥黛特似乎突然陷入了绝望，仿佛她已经决定不再与生活中的巨大困难作斗争，而斯万焦急地数着他离开餐厅后开车的时间点还剩多少分钟。回到她家，他可以向她讨个说法，让她答应，要么她明天不去茶头，要么她也给他弄个邀请，让她在怀里安息一下痛苦。这仍然折磨着他。终于订好了马车。女士。维尔迪兰对斯旺说：

‘Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,’ trying, by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him from noticing that she Was not saying, as she would always have until then:
‘那么，再见。我希望我们很快就能见到你，”她试图通过友好的举止和克制的微笑，不让他注意到她并没有像以前那样说：

‘To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after.’ M. and Mme. Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann’s was drawn up behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into his own.
“那么，明天在Chatou，后天在我家。”M.和Mme。维尔迪兰让福什维尔上了他们的马车。斯旺的车停在车后面，他等他们的车启动后才帮奥黛特进入自己的车。

‘Odette, we’ll take you,’ said Mme. Verdurin, ‘we’ve kept a little corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.’
“奥黛特，我们带你去，”夫人说。维尔迪兰：“我们在德福什维尔先生旁边专门为你留了一个小角落。”

‘Yes, Mme. Verdurin,’ said Odette meekly.
“是的，夫人。维尔迪兰，”奥黛特温顺地说。

‘What! I thought I was to take you home,’ cried Swann, flinging discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her.
'什么！ “我以为我要带你回家，”斯旺大声喊道，把谨慎抛到九霄云外，因为马车门开着，时间很宝贵，以他现在的情况，没有她就不能回家。

‘But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...’
“但是夫人。维尔迪兰问我……”

‘That’s all right, you can quite well go home alone; we’ve left you like this dozens of times,’ said Mme. Verdurin.
‘没关系，你一个人回家就可以了；我们已经像这样离开你几十次了，”夫人说。韦尔迪兰。

‘But I had something important to tell Mme. de Crécy.’
“但我有一些重要的事情要告诉夫人。德·克雷西。”

‘Very well, you can write it to her instead.’
“很好，你可以写给她。”

‘Good-bye,’ said Odette, holding out her hand.
“再见，”奥黛特伸出手说道。

He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected.
他努力想笑，却只能露出沮丧的表情。

‘What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?’ Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. ‘I was afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn’t he say, straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can’t conceive how Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, ‘You belong to me!’ I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me.’ A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: ‘No, but, don’t you see, the filthy creature ...’ using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself—like Françoise at Combray when the chicken refused to die—the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin’s carriage had moved on, and Swann’s took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news.
“你觉得斯万乐意和我们一起表现出的样子怎么样？”维尔迪兰问她丈夫他们什么时候到家。 “我担心他会吃掉我，只是因为我们提出要把奥黛特带回来。诸如此类的事情实在是太糟糕了。他为什么不直接说我们的房子很乱呢？我无法想象奥黛特怎么能忍受这样的举止。他似乎一直在积极地说，“你属于我！”我将准确地告诉奥黛特我对这一切的想法，我希望她能有理智地理解我。”过了一会儿，她含糊其辞地补充道愤怒地说道：“不，但是，你难道没有看到吗，这个肮脏的生物……”无意识地使用，也许是为了满足同样模糊的需要来为自己辩护——就像贡布雷的弗朗索瓦丝，当鸡拒绝死亡时——这是一只无害的动物在临终痛苦中最后的抽搐，是从正在结束其生命的农民嘴里挤出来的。当女士。维尔迪兰的马车已经继续前行，斯万的马车取代了它的位置，他的马车夫看到了他的脸，问他是否身体不舒服，或者听到了坏消息。

Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the ‘little nucleus’ and extolling the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins’ drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame.
斯旺把他打发走了。他更喜欢步行，他就是步行穿过森林回家的。他大声自言自语，语气略带矫揉造作，就像他在描述“小核心”的魅力和赞扬维尔迪兰家族的宽宏大量时所用的语气一样。但是，正如奥黛特的谈话、微笑、亲吻对他来说变得同样令人厌恶，就像他曾经觉得它们很迷人一样，如果它们被转移到除了他自己之外的其他人身上，同样，维尔迪兰家的客厅，不到一个小时前，他仍然觉得很有趣，受到了对艺术的真正感情的启发，甚至受到了某种道德贵族的启发，现在奥黛特在那里遇见的不是他自己，而是毫无节制地爱着那里，向他展示了一切。荒谬，它的愚蠢，它的耻辱。

He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party next evening at Chatou. ‘Imagine going to Chatou, of all places! Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime in their smugness; they can’t really exist; they must all have come out of one of Labiche’s plays!’
他画了一幅第二天晚上在茶头举行的聚会的幻想画，看到这幅画，他厌恶得浑身发抖。 “想象一下去茶头，在所有的地方！就像打烊时间后很多窗帘布一样！老实说，这些人的自鸣得意是很崇高的。它们不可能真正存在；他们肯定都是从拉比什的一部戏剧中走出来的！

The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. ‘Could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one another like that. They’d imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul they would, if they didn’t all meet again to-morrow at Chatou!’ Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country, ‘for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a fool!’
科塔尔一家也会在那里；可能是布里肖。 “还有什么比这些小动物的生活更怪诞的吗？它们就这样互相依偎着。”他们会想象自己完全迷失了，以我的灵魂发誓，如果他们明天不在茶头再次见面的话，他们会的！’唉！那里也会有一位画家，一位喜欢牵线搭桥的画家，他会邀请福什维尔和奥黛特一起去他的工作室。他可以看到奥黛特，穿着一件对于这个国家来说太时髦的衣服，“因为她在这方面太粗俗了，而且，可怜的小东西，她真是个傻瓜！”

He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the ‘bore’ might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. ‘What a fetid form of humour!’ he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar. ‘How, in God’s name, can a creature made in His image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!’ he cried, tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. ‘God knows that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its limits, and mine is at an end,’ he concluded, as though this sacred mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from him.
他能听到夫人的笑话。维尔迪兰会在晚饭后讲一些笑话，无论这些笑话的目标是谁，总是让他觉得很有趣，因为他可以看到奥黛特嘲笑他们，和他一起笑，她的笑声几乎是他的一部分。现在他觉得他们可能会让奥黛特发笑的就是他。 “这真是一种恶臭的幽默！”他惊呼道，嘴角扭曲成一种厌恶的表情，这种表情如此强烈，以至于他能感觉到喉咙里的肌肉在衣领处僵硬。 ‘以上帝的名义，按照他的形象创造的生物怎么能在那些令人作呕的俏皮话中找到可笑的地方呢？即使是最不敏感的鼻子也一定会因这种浑浊的呼气而惊慌失措。实在令人难以置信的是，任何一个人都无法理解，仅仅让自己微笑，而牺牲了一个忠诚地向她伸出手的同胞，她就将自己陷入了泥潭，而这个泥潭将让她陷入困境。即使有世界上最好的意愿，也永远不可能营救她。我住在水坑上方好几英里的地方，这些肮脏的小害虫在水坑里四肢伸展、爬行、叫喊着它们廉价的下流话，我不可能被维尔迪兰的俏皮话溅到！”他喊道，抬起头，傲慢地挺直身体。 “天知道我曾真诚地试图将奥黛特从下水道中拉出来，并教她呼吸更高尚、更纯净的空气。 但人类的耐心是有限度的，而我的耐心已经到了尽头。”他总结道，仿佛将奥黛特从讽刺气氛中拉出来的神圣使命早在几分钟前就已开始，又仿佛他不是从那时起才承担起这项任务的。他突然想到，这些讽刺也许是针对他自己的，并且可能会产生使奥黛特与他疏远的效果。

He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by Beethoven’s music. ‘Idiot, liar!’ he shouted, ‘and a creature like that imagines that she’s fond of Art!’ She would say to Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for himself: ‘You can make room for M. de Forcheville there, can’t you, Odette?’... ‘“In the dark!’ Codfish! Pander!’ ... ‘Pander’ was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each other’s eyes, to feel for each other’s hands. He felt that there was much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in France.
他可以看到钢琴家坐下来弹奏《月光奏鸣曲》，还可以看到夫人的鬼脸。维尔迪兰害怕贝多芬的音乐会摧毁她的神经。 “白痴，骗子！”他喊道，“这样的生物还以为她喜欢艺术！”在熟练地暗示了福什维尔几句赞美之后，她会对奥黛特说，就像她经常为自己做的那样：“你可以在那里为德·福什维尔先生腾出地方，不是吗，奥黛特？”……““在黑暗中！”鳕鱼！ Pander！”……“Pander”也是他给音乐起的名字，这种音乐邀请他们静静地坐着，一起做梦，凝视彼此的眼睛，感受彼此的双手。他觉得对于艺术的严格审查态度毕竟有很多话要说，比如柏拉图所采用的、博须埃以及法国的旧式教育学派。

In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins’, which he had so often described as ‘genuine,’ seemed to him now the worst possible form of life, and their ‘little nucleus’ the most degraded class of society. ‘It really is,’ he repeated, ‘beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely people ‘in society’ (and, though one may find fault with them now and then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there is in that ‘Noli me tangere’ motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.’
总之，他经常将他们在维尔迪兰家过的生活描述为“真正的”，现在对他来说似乎是最糟糕的生活形式，而他们的“小核心”则是社会中最堕落的阶级。 “确实如此，”他重复道，“在社会阶梯的最底层，但丁的最底层。”毫无疑问，佛罗伦萨人的庄严话语指的是维尔迪兰家族！仔细想想，‘社会上’的人们（尽管人们可能会时不时地对他们指手画脚，但毕竟他们与那帮勒索者是两码事）肯定在拒绝时表现出了深刻的睿智。了解他们，甚至用他们弄脏他们的指尖。圣日耳曼郊区的座右铭“Noli me tangere”是多么明智的直觉啊。

He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had almost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night: ‘People ‘in society’ have their failings, as no one knows better than I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are impossible. So-and-so’ (a fashionable woman whom he had known) ‘was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there’s something complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they’re the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung.’
他早已从布瓦的小道和林荫道上出来了，几乎已经到了自己的家了，而且，他还没有摆脱悲伤的陶醉，也没有摆脱不真诚的心血来潮，而是越来越兴奋。他用虚假的语调、人造的响亮声音，在寂静的夜里继续大声朗诵：‘社会上的人有他们的缺点，没有人比我更清楚；’但毕竟，至少对他们来说，有些事情是不可能的。某某（他认识的一位时尚女性）“远非完美，但毕竟，人们确实在她身上发现了一种基本的微妙，她行为上的忠诚，使她无论发生什么，都无法这是一项重罪，在她和像维尔迪兰这样的老太婆之间划出了一道巨大的鸿沟。维尔迪兰！多好的名字呀！哦，它们有一些完整的东西，它们的打字准确度近乎完美。他们是令人厌恶的阶级中最完美的典范！感谢上帝，现在是我停止屈尊与这样的臭名昭著、这样的粪便乱交的时候了。

But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him from Odette alone;—so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their ‘infamy.’ Doubtless Swann’s voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; ‘I believe I have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!’ But it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table at their house:
但是，正如他在一个小时左右之前仍然认为维尔迪兰夫妇的美德一样，即使维尔迪兰夫妇确实拥有这些美德，如果他们没有偏爱和保护他的爱情，也不足以激发斯旺的兴趣。那种陶醉的状态让他对他们的宽宏大量变得温柔起来，这种陶醉，即使通过其他人的媒介传播，也可能是来自奥黛特一个人；——所以他现在的不道德行为（如果它真的存在的话）如果他们没有邀请奥黛特和福什维尔一起，而没有他的话，维尔迪兰家族中的人将无能为力，以阻止他的愤怒，让他痛斥他们的“耻辱”。毫无疑问，斯旺的声音比他自己的声音更敏锐。他拒绝说出那些充满对维尔迪兰家族和他们的圈子的厌恶的话，以及对他摆脱了他们的束缚而感到高兴的话语，除了用一种做作和修辞的语气，仿佛他的话是为了平息他的愤怒而不是为了平息他的愤怒。表达他的想法。事实上，后者在他尽情谩骂时，很可能（尽管他自己不知道）正忙着一件完全不同的事情，因为他一到家，刚关上身后的前门，他突然敲了一下额头，让仆人再次打开门，然后冲到街上大喊大叫，这次的声音很自然。 “我相信我已经找到了一种方法，可以被邀请参加明天在茶头举行的晚宴！”但这一定是一个糟糕的方法，因为斯旺先生没有被邀请；博士。科塔尔被传唤去参加该国的一起重大案件，他已经好几天没有见到维尔迪兰夫妇了，并且被阻止出现在查图。他们的房子：

‘Why, aren’t we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you might call a personal friend...’ ‘I sincerely trust that we sha’n’t!’ cried Mme. Verdurin. ‘Heaven preserve us from him; he’s too deadly for words, a stupid, ill-bred boor.’
“为什么，我们今晚不去见斯旺先生吗？”他可以说是你所谓的私人朋友……” “我真诚地相信我们不会！”夫人喊道。韦尔迪兰。 ‘愿上天保护我们免受他的侵害；他太致命了，无法用言语来形容，是一个愚蠢、没有教养的乡巴佬。

On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied: ‘Oh—oh—oh—oh—oh!’ traversing, in an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins’.
听到这些话，科塔尔表现出一种强烈的惊讶，同时又完全屈服，仿佛面对着一个与他以前所相信的一切相矛盾的科学真理，但却得到了不可抗拒的证据的支持；他怀着胆怯的情绪，低下头，捂着盘子，只是回答道：“哦——哦——哦——哦——哦！”他的力量有序地撤退，沿着递减的尺度，穿越到他存在的深处，他的整个声音。此后，维尔迪兰家就不再谈论斯万了。

And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him, as she had said in the early days of their love: ‘We shall meet, anyhow, to-morrow evening; there’s a supper-party at the Verdurins’,’ but ‘We sha’n’t be able to meet to-morrow evening; there’s a supper-party at the Verdurins’.’ Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Opéra-Comique, to see Une Nuit de Cléopâtre, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. ‘Yet I’m not really angry,’ he assured himself, ‘when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I’m disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Massé! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: ‘I shall not go,’ if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all.’ And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette’s spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem.
于是，斯万和奥杰特聚集在一起的客厅就成了他们见面的障碍。她不再像他们恋爱初期那样对他说：“无论如何，我们明天晚上就会见面；我们一定会见面的。”维尔迪兰家有一个晚宴，”但是“我们明天晚上不能见面；韦尔迪兰家有一个晚宴。”或者韦尔迪兰家正带她去喜剧歌剧院，去看《克利奥帕特之夜》，斯万可以从她眼中读到那种恐惧，生怕他会叫她不要去，这但就在不久前，他还情不自禁地在情妇的脸上飞过一个吻，但现在却激怒了他。 “然而，当我看到她多么渴望逃跑，在喧闹的粪堆里抓蛆虫时，”他向自己保证，“但我并不是真的生气。”我很失望;不是为了我自己，而是为了她；失望地发现，在与自己日常接触的生活了六个多月之后，她仍然无法改善自己的思想，甚至无法自发地消除对维克多·马塞的兴趣！更重要的是，她还没有达到这样的境界：在某些夜晚，当她被要求时，任何有哪怕一点点精致感情的人都应该愿意放弃娱乐。如果只是出于政策考虑，她应该有理智地说：“我不会去”，因为她现在的回答将一劳永逸地决定她灵魂的品质。’他说服自己，毕竟，他希望她那天晚上留在家里而不是去喜歌剧院，只是为了对奥黛特的精神价值有一个有利的评价，于是他采纳了这一建议。他用同样的推理方式对她进行推理，与他对自己使用的同样程度的不真诚，甚至程度更高，因为在她的情况下，他也屈服于用她自己的自尊来俘获她的欲望。

‘I swear to you,’ he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the theatre, ‘that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cléopâtre (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the effect—I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your Nuit de Cléopâtre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due warning.’
“我向你发誓，”在她出发去剧院前不久，他对她说，“如果我是一个自私的人，我希望你不要去，因为你应该拒绝，因为今晚我还有一千件其他的事情要做，如果你告诉我你不去的话，我会觉得自己被欺骗了，自己也陷入了困境，并且会非常恼火。但我的职业、我的乐趣并不是一切；我也必须想你。也许有一天，当我看到我与你不可挽回地分离时，你将有权责备我没有在决定性的时刻警告你，在这一时刻我觉得我要对你做出判断，那些严厉的判断之一是爱无法长久抵抗。你看，你的《Nuit de Cléopâtre》（多好的标题啊！）与要点无关。我必须知道的是，你是否确实是那些心智甚至魅力最低等的生物之一，是那些无法放弃快乐的可鄙生物之一。因为如果你是这样，怎么会有人爱你，因为你甚至不是一个人，一个确定的、不完美的、但至少是可感知的实体。你是一滴无形的水，会沿着它可能遇到的任何斜坡淌下来，是一条没有记忆、没有思考能力的鱼，它在水族箱里的一生都会不断地撞向墙壁，每天一百次玻璃，总是误认为是水。你是否意识到你的回答会产生这样的效果——我不是说让我从那一刻起不再爱你，这是不言而喻的，而是当我意识到你不是一个人时，让你在我眼中不再那么有吸引力，你在世界上的一切之下却没有智慧将自己提升一英寸？ 显然，我应该更愿意请你放弃你的“Nuit de Cléopâtre”（因为你强迫我用如此卑鄙的名字玷污我的嘴唇），就好像这是一件无关紧要的事情一样，希望尽管如此，你还是会去的。但是，既然我决定权衡一下你，让如此严重的问题取决于你的回答，我认为向你发出适当的警告更为光荣。’

Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty. Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would ‘never’ as she told him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, ‘get there in time for the Overture.’
与此同时，奥黛特表现出情绪和不确定性不断增加的迹象。虽然她无法理解他长篇大论的意义，但她明白这应该包括在责备或恳求的场景中，而她对人类行为方式的熟悉使她能够在不理会所说的话的情况下，理解这些场景。得出这样的结论：除非相爱，否则男人不会创造；从他们相爱的那一刻起，服从他们就是多余的，因为以后他们只会更加相爱。因此，如果她没有注意到天色已晚，她会非常平静地听斯万讲话，而且如果他继续讲下去，她“永远”不会像她带着可爱的微笑告诉他的那样，固执地坚持下去。但有点羞愧，“及时到达那里，听序曲。”

On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. ‘Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,’ he had told her, ‘can’t you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission—how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed!’ In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann’s discovering that she had not told him the truth.
在其他场合，他曾向自己保证，最能让他不再爱她的一件事就是她拒绝放弃撒谎的习惯。 “即使从卖弄风情的角度来看，纯粹而简单，”他告诉她，“你难道看不出来，当你堕落到撒谎时，你会失去多少吸引力吗？”坦率地承认——你可以弥补多少错误！真的，你远没有我想象的那么聪明！”然而，斯旺向她解释了她不撒谎的所有理由，但徒劳无功。他们本可以成功地推翻任何普遍的谎言体系，但奥黛特没有这样的体系；只要她希望斯万对她所做的一切一无所知，不告诉他，她就满足了。因此，谎言对她来说只是一种特殊的权宜之计。能够让她决定是否应该利用谎言的一件事也是一个特殊的、偶然的原因，即斯旺发现她没有告诉他真相的风险。

Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account.
从身体上来说，她正在经历一个不幸的阶段。她越来越胖了，从前那种富有表现力、悲伤的魅力、惊讶、渴望的表情，似乎都随着她的青春期而消失了，结果，在斯旺发现她的那一刻，她就变得最珍贵了。明显不太好看。他会连续几个小时凝视她，试图重新找回他曾经在她身上看到但再也找不到的魅力。然而，斯万知道，在这个陌生的新蛹中，潜伏着的仍然是奥黛特，仍然是同样反复无常的性情，狡猾而回避，这足以让斯万继续以一如既往的热情寻求着迷住她。然后他会看着她两年前拍的照片，会记得她是多么的精致。这会让他得到一点安慰，因为他为了她而自愿承受了所有的痛苦。

When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to Meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme. Verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris: ‘She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you’re with us? Anyhow, I’ll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.’
当维尔迪兰一家带她去圣日耳曼、查图或默兰时，如果天气好的话，他们常常会提议留在那里过夜，直到第二天才回家。女士。维尔迪兰会尽力消除这位钢琴家的顾虑，因为他的姨妈还留在巴黎：“她会很高兴有一天能摆脱你。”当她知道你和我们在一起时，她到底怎么会焦虑呢？无论如何，我会把你们都纳入我的羽翼之下；她可以把责任归咎于我。

If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first finding out which of the ‘faithful’ had anyone whom they must warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compiègne, on the painter’s advice, to watch the sun setting through the forest—after which they went on to the Château of Pierrefonds.
如果这次尝试失败，维尔迪兰先生将出发穿越全国，直到他来到电报局或其他某种信使那里，首先找出哪些“忠实者”有必须警告的人。但奥黛特会感谢他，并向他保证，她不会向任何人传达任何信息，因为她已经一劳永逸地告诉斯万，她不可能在所有这些人面前向他发送信息，而不会让自己受到损害。有时她会连续缺席几天，维尔迪兰家族带她去看德勒的坟墓，或者按照画家的建议去贡比涅观看日落穿过森林——之后他们继续前往城堡。皮埃尔丰。

‘To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.’
“想到她可以和我一起参观真正历史悠久的建筑，我花了十年时间研究建筑，不断受到真正重要的人的轰炸，以接管博韦或圣卢德诺，并且拒绝接受除她以外的任何人；相反，她带着最低等、最残酷的堕落的生物走去，为路易·菲利普和维奥莱·勒·杜克的石化排泄物而欣喜若狂！我应该说，一个人几乎不需要太多的艺术知识就能做到这一点；不过，可以肯定的是，即使没有任何特别灵敏的嗅觉，人们也不会故意选择在厕所里度过假期，以便在它们散发出的芬芳气味的范围内。

But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds—alas, without allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said, that would ‘create a dreadful impression,’—he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover’s library, the railway timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o’clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines.
但当她动身前往德勒或皮埃尔丰时——唉，不允许他出现在那里，仿佛偶然出现在她身边，因为，正如她所说，那会“给人留下可怕的印象”——他就会陷入困境。情人图书馆里最令人陶醉的浪漫，是铁路时刻表，他从中得知如何在下午、晚上、甚至早上与她会合。方式？更重要的是，还有权力，有权利加入她。毕竟，时刻表和火车本身不适合狗。如果通过印刷广告仔细告知公众，早上八点有一列开往皮埃尔丰的火车，十点到达那里，那只能是因为去皮埃尔丰是合法行为，并且得到了政府的许可。奥黛特就显得多余了；而且，这种行为的动机可能与见到奥黛特的愿望完全不同，因为那些从未听说过她的人每天都会这样做，而且数量如此之多，足以证明为发动机加油的劳力和费用是合理的。

So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc’s work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compiègne.
所以事情就这样发生了；如果他选择去皮埃尔丰，她无法阻止他。现在，这正是他发现他确实选择做的事情，而且如果他像旅行的公众一样不熟悉奥黛特，那么此刻他也会这么做。很长一段时间以来，他一直想对维奥莱·勒·杜克作为修复者的工作形成更明确的印象。鉴于当时的天气，他非常想在贡比涅的森林里漫步一整天。

It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: ‘What, you here?’ and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him. ‘So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!’ she would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go.
确实，她禁止他进入今天吸引他的地方，这确实是一种运气。今天！哎呀，如果他不顾她的禁止，去那里的话，当天就能见到她了！但是，如果她在皮埃尔丰遇到了某个无关紧要的人，她会明显高兴地向他打招呼：“什么，你在这里？”并会邀请他来旅馆看她。她住在维尔迪兰家，如果，另一方面，她在那里遇到的是他自己，斯万，她会生气，会抱怨她被跟踪，结果会减少对他的爱，甚至可能会转身离开。当她看到他时愤怒。 “那么，无论在哪里，我一天都不准离开！”回来后她会责备他，但事实上，不准走的却是他本人。

He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compiègne and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann’s consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Château, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;—innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided heart. ‘We mustn’t, on any account,’ he would warn M. de Forestelle, ‘run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn’t go a yard without meeting them.’ And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiègne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little ‘group,’ he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: ‘No, I’m afraid not; I can’t go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is there.’ And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of Compiègne, as though it had been that of the ‘Pays du Tendre’; he surrounded himself with photographs of the Château of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.
他突然有了一个想法，为了设法访问贡比涅和皮埃尔丰，而不让人认为他的目的是会见奥黛特，他得到了他的一位朋友，福雷斯泰尔侯爵的邀请，他在法国拥有一栋乡间别墅。那个街区。斯万向这位朋友提出了这个计划，但没有透露其不可告人的目的，他欣喜若狂。十五年后，斯旺终于同意下来参观他的庄园，他毫不掩饰自己的惊讶，而且由于他（他告诉他）不想留在那里，所以答应至少要花几天时间，去参观一下他的庄园。他在该地区散步和游览。斯万想象自己已经和德福雷斯特尔先生在一起了。甚至在他见到奥黛特之前，即使他没能在那儿见到她，踏上这片土地将会是多么令人高兴，因为他不知道在任何时候都能找到她的确切地点。他会感到她突然出现在他周围令人兴奋的可能性：在城堡的庭院里，现在在他眼中很美丽，因为他是为了她才去参观的；城里的每条街道都让他觉得浪漫；沿着森林的每一个小路，都被夕阳的深沉而温柔的光芒染成玫瑰色；——无数的、可供选择的藏身之处，在他不确定的无处不在的希望、他快乐、流浪和分裂的心中，他会同时飞向这些藏身之处。 “无论如何，”他会警告德福雷斯特尔先生，“我们决不能碰上奥黛特和维尔迪兰一家。”我刚刚听说他们今天在皮埃尔丰。人们有足够的时间在巴黎见到他们；如果一个人不能走一码而不遇到他们，那么来这里就太不值得了。” 而他的东道主也无法理解，为什么一到目的地，斯旺就会在一小时内改变二十次计划，把贡比涅所有酒店的餐厅都检查一遍，却拿不定主意安顿下来。尽管他在其中任何一个地方都没有发现维尔迪兰一家的踪迹，但他似乎正在寻找他声称最想避免的东西，事实上，一旦他发现它，他就会避免，因为如果他来的话看到这一小群人，他会表现出刻意的冷漠，立即匆匆离去，因为他很满意自己看到了奥黛特和她，尤其是她在他显然没有想她的时候看到了他。但不是;她立刻就会猜到，他是为了她才来这里的。当德福雷斯泰尔先生来接他时，已经到了出发的时间，他便告辞道：“不，恐怕不行；”我今天不能去皮埃尔丰。你看，奥黛特就在那儿。”尽管如此，斯万还是很高兴，因为他觉得，如果他是凡人中唯一的一个人，那天没有权利去皮埃尔丰，那是因为他实际上对奥黛特来说是某个人。与其他凡人不同的人，她的爱人；因为这种对他个人自由旅行的普遍权利的限​​制只是这种奴役的多种形式之一，而这种爱对他来说是如此珍贵。决定了，还是不要冒着跟她吵架的风险，耐心等待她回来。他整天都在仔细研究贡比涅森林的地图，就好像那是“Pays du Tendre”的地图一样。他身边堆满了皮埃尔丰城堡的照片。 当她可能回来的那一天到来时，他再次打开时刻表，计算出她必须乘坐哪趟火车，以及如果她推迟出发，还剩下哪些火车可供她乘坐。他没有离开家，因为担心错过电报，他也没有上床睡觉，以防她乘末班火车来时，决定半夜来访，给他一个惊喜。是的！前门铃响了。开门似乎有些迟缓，他想叫醒门房，他探出窗外向奥黛特喊道，如果是奥黛特的话，尽管他已经下楼十几次亲自送达命令了。 ，他们很有能力告诉她他不在家。进来的只是一个仆人。他注意到过往的马车不断发出隆隆声，这是他以前从未关注过的。他能听见他们的声音，一个接一个，从很远的地方传来，又越来越近，不停地经过他的门，并把一条不适合他的信息带到远处。他等了整整一夜，但毫无结果，因为维尔迪兰一家意外地回来了，而奥黛特从中午就到了巴黎。她没想到要告诉他；她不知道该怎么办，独自一人在剧院度过了一个晚上，很早就回家睡觉了，睡得很安稳。

As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments as these, in which she forgot Swann’s very existence, were of more value to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins’ and had hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets. But their faces—a collective and formless mass—escaped the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann’s brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried out: ‘Heaven help me!’ as people, after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann’s daily life—when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed—by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call ‘romantic’; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lapérouse. Sometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood; at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In Swann’s mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of ‘inquiry agents’ to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead for twenty years.
事实上，她从来没有想过他。在这样的时刻，她忘记了斯万的存在，对奥黛特来说更有价值，比她所有的不忠更能让他依附于她。因为就这样，斯万一直处于痛苦的激动状态，而在以前，当他在维尔迪兰家没能找到奥黛特并整晚都在寻找她时，这种状态曾一度有效地使他的兴趣变成了爱情。他也没有度过快乐的日子（就像我后来在贡布雷度过的童年一样），在这些日子里，他会忘记夜晚带来的痛苦。在他的日子里，斯旺必须在没有奥黛特的情况下度过这些日子。正如他时不时对自己说的那样，让这么漂亮的女人独自在巴黎外出，就像把一个装满珠宝的箱子留在街中央一样鲁莽。在这种心情下，他会对路人怒目而视，仿佛他们是一群扒手。但他们的脸——一群无形的集体——逃脱了他的想象，因此未能点燃他的嫉妒之火。这种努力耗尽了斯旺的大脑，直到他把手放在眼睛上，大声喊道：“上帝帮助我！”就像人们在努力掌握外部世界的现实问题时将自己陷入智力狂热之后，或者灵魂不朽，通过非理性的信仰行为来缓解他们疲惫的大脑。 但是，斯万日常生活中所有最简单的行为——当他吃饭、打开信件、散步或睡觉时——都不断地、不可分割地与他缺席的情妇的想法融为一体，因为他对不得不执行任务感到遗憾。那些没有她的行动；就像美丽的菲利伯特的名字首字母一样，在布劳的教堂里，奥地利的玛格丽特因为她的悲伤和对他的渴望，到处都与她自己的名字交织在一起。有时，他不会呆在家里，而是去不远处的一家餐馆吃午饭，不久前他就被那家餐馆的精美烹饪所吸引，但现在他只去那里吃一顿饭。这些理由既神秘又荒谬，人们称之为“浪漫”；因为这家餐厅（顺便说一句，它仍然存在）与奥黛特居住的街道同名：Lapérouse。有时，当她去某个地方短暂访问时，几天后她才会想到让他知道她已经回到了巴黎。然后她会非常简单地说，不惜一切代价用从事实中借来的一点片段来遮盖自己（就像她曾经采取的那样），她刚刚在那一刻到达了早上的火车。她所说的是谎言；至少对奥杰特来说，这是一个谎言，前后矛盾，缺乏（如果是真的的话）她对自己实际到达车站的记忆的支持；当她说这句话的时候，她甚至无法在脑海中形成自己所说的话，因为她的脑海中出现了一个矛盾的画面，无论她假装下车的那一刻，她确实在做什么完全不同的事情。火车。 然而，在斯万的心里，这些话没有遇到任何反对，变得坚定而坚定，直到它们假定了一个不容置疑的不可摧毁的真理，以至于如果某个朋友碰巧告诉他，他是乘同一趟火车来的，并且没有看到奥黛特，斯万就会他会确信是他的朋友在日期或时间上犯了错误，因为他的版本与奥黛特所说的话不一致。这些话在他看来从来都不是假的，除非在听到这些话之前他就怀疑它们会是假的。要让他相信她在撒谎，预先的怀疑是必不可少的。然而，这也足够了。鉴于此，奥黛特所说的一切在他看来都是可疑的。她有没有提到一个名字：显然是她的一位情人的名字；一旦这个假设形成，他就会花几个星期的时间来折磨自己。有一次，他甚至联系了一家“调查代理人”公司，以查明未知对手的地址和职业，而在他被证明出国之前，这个对手将让他不得安宁，而他（最终得知）是谁？奥黛特的叔叔，已经去世二十年了。

Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited—at Forcheville’s, at the painter’s, or at a charity ball given in one of the Ministries—he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which—while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray—seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter’s studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incohérents, to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect, made Odette’s return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)—in these words, which Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: ‘Can’t you wait a minute for me? I’m just going; we’ll drive back together and you can drop me.’ It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette’s gate, he had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann: ‘Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn’t stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and he’s not at all pleased if I have visitors when he’s here. Oh, if you only knew the creature as I know him; isn’t that so, my love, there’s no one that really knows you, is there, except me?’
尽管她通常不允许他在公共聚会上与她见面，说人们会说话，但偶尔会发生这样的情况，在他和她各自受邀参加的晚会上——在福什维尔家，在画家家，或者在某个部委举办的慈善舞会上——他发现自己和她在同一个房间。他可以看到她，但不敢留下来，因为担心她似乎在窥探她在其他人的陪伴下所享受的快乐，从而惹恼了她，而他则像我一样焦急地开车回家，然后上床睡觉。几年后，当他来贡布雷和我们一起吃饭的晚上，他要上床睡觉——这对他来说似乎是无限的，因为他无法看到他们的结局。 而且，有一两次，他从这样的夜晚中获得了一种人们倾向于称之为平静的幸福（这不是源于焦虑突然终止的如此剧烈的反应吗），因为它在于心灵的平静：他在画家工作室里看了一会儿狂欢，正准备回家。他把奥黛特抛在了身后，她变成了一个才华横溢的陌生人，周围都是男人，对他们来说，她的目光和她的欢乐，这不是他的，似乎暗示着某种淫荡的快乐，可以在那里或其他地方（可能是在不相干的舞厅） ，想到她可能会继续下去，他就浑身发抖）这让斯旺比想到他们实际的身体结合更加嫉妒，因为这更难以想象；他正要打开门准备走，这时他听到自己用这句话叫了回来（这句话，通过切断与聚会的联系，使他如此震惊的可能的结局，使聚会本身在回想起来显得无辜，使奥黛特回家成为一件事不再是不可想象和可怕的，而是温柔和熟悉的，一个在他的马车里紧贴在他身边的东西，就像他自己日常生活的一部分；一个剥夺了奥黛特外表上多余的光彩和欢乐的东西，表明这只是她暂时伪装的，为了他，而不是为了任何神秘的快乐，她已经厌倦了这种伪装）——用这句话来说，奥黛特在他身后扔出了这句话。跨过门槛：“你就不能等我一下吗？”我正要走；我们一起开车回去，你可以送我。确实，有一次福什维尔要求同时开车回家，但当他到达奥黛特家门口时，他恳求让他也进来，她用一根手指指着斯旺回答道： '啊！这取决于这位先生。你必须问他。很好，如果你坚持的话，你可以进来，就一会儿，但你不能呆太久，因为，我警告你，他喜欢坐下来和我安静地交谈，如果我这样做，他一点也不高兴。当他在这里时有访客。哦，如果你像我一样了解这个生物就好了；不是吗，亲爱的，除了我，没有人真正了解你，不是吗？’

And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: ‘I feel sure you haven’t written yet to your friends, about dining with them on Sunday. You needn’t go if you don’t want to, but you might at least be polite,’ or ‘Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I’m going to make you work, I can tell you,’ which proved that Odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his.
斯旺也许更被她在福什维尔面前这样对他讲话的景象所感动，不仅是这些温柔的偏爱之词，而且还有某些批评，例如：“我确信你没有写过”还有你的朋友，周日和他们一起吃饭。如果你不想去的话，你可以不必去，但你至少可以有礼貌，”或者“现在，你把关于维米尔的文章留在这里了，这样你明天可以再做一点吗？真是个懒骨头啊！我可以告诉你，我会让你工作的。”这证明奥黛特一直与他的社交活动和文学作品保持联系，他们确实有共同的生活。当她说话时，她对他露出了一个微笑，他将这微笑理解为她完全属于他。

And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette’s house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette’s real life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette’s life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her—and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been Odette’s bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann’s life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on—like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his longing,—a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity.
然后，当她正在给他们泡橙汁时，突然间，就像一盏安装不当的灯的反光镜开始在一个物体周围投射出巨大而奇妙的阴影，在它后面的墙上，这些阴影随着时间的推移而收缩和收缩。当他迷失在物体本身的阴影中时，他对奥黛特形成的所有可怕和令人不安的想法都融化了，消失在站在他眼前的迷人生物身上。 他突然怀疑，在奥黛特家的灯光下度过的这一个小时，也许毕竟不是一个人为的时间，是为他的特殊用途而发明的（目的是隐藏那不断出现的令人恐惧和美味的东西）在他的脑海里，但他无法对它形成一个令人满意的印象，奥黛特现实生活的一个小时，当他不在场时，她的生活，戏剧性的财产和纸板水果，但也许是奥黛特真正的一个小时生活;如果他本人不在场，她就会为福什维尔拉出同一张扶手椅，为他倒上的不是任何不知名的啤酒，而是她现在递给他们俩的橙汁。奥黛特所居住的世界并不是他花时间把她安置在其中的那个可怕而超自然的世界——这个世界也许只存在于他的想象中，而是真实的宇宙，没有散发出特殊的阴郁气氛，包括他现在可以坐下来写那张桌子，现在他被允许品尝这杯饮料；他怀着同样的好奇和钦佩和感激之情思考着所有的物体，因为如果在吸收他的梦想的过程中，它们使他摆脱了痴迷，那么反过来，它们本身也因吸收而变得丰富。它们向他展示了他的幻想的明显实现，并且引起了他的兴趣。它们在他眼前成形、变得坚实，同时也抚慰了他不安的心。啊! 命运允许他与奥黛特共用一个住所，这样在她的房子里他就应该是在自己的房子里。如果当他问仆人午餐吃什么时，他从答复中得知的是奥黛特的菜单；如果早上奥黛特想去布洛涅森林大道散步，尽管他不想出去，但他作为一个好丈夫的责任还是有义务陪着她，背着她当她太热时，她会穿斗篷；晚上，晚饭后，如果她想留在家里，不穿衣服，如果他被迫留在她身边，按照她的要求做；那么，斯万生活中的所有琐碎细节，现在在他看来是如此阴郁，仅仅因为它们同时构成了奥黛特生活的一部分，会多么彻底地呈现出来——就像那盏灯，那杯橙汁，那把扶手椅吸收了他那么多的梦想，实现了他那么多的渴望——一种超量的甜蜜和神秘的坚固。

And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette’s daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest—as he had several times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then was.
然而他倾向于怀疑，他如此渴望的状态是一种平静、和平，这不会创造出有利于他的爱情的气氛。当奥黛特对他来说不再是一个总是缺席、遗憾、想象的生物时；当他对她的感情不再是奏鸣曲中的乐句给他带来的那种神秘的不安，而是持续不断的爱意和感激之情，当他们之间建立起正常的关系，这将结束他的忧郁疯狂;那么，毫无疑问，奥黛特的日常生活行为对他来说似乎没有什么内在的兴趣——就像他已经好几次感觉到的那样，例如，当他读完的那天，它的信封，她写给福什维尔的信。他以科学的超然态度审视自己的病痛，就好像他为自己接种了疫苗以研究其效果一样，他告诉自己，当他的病痊愈后，奥黛特会做什么或不做什么对他来说将是无关紧要的。但在他病态的状态下，说实话，他害怕死亡本身，不过是这样的康复，事实上，这相当于他当时的一切的死亡。

After these quiet evenings, Swann’s suspicions would be temporarily lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning, would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet.
经过这些安静的夜晚后，斯万的怀疑会暂时平息。他会祝福奥黛特的名字，第二天早上，他会订购最吸引人的珠宝送给她，因为她一夜之间对他的好意激起了他的感激之情，或者渴望看到它们重复出现，或者对她的爱突然爆发，需要这样的出口。

But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine that Odette was Forcheville’s mistress, and that, when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the Verdurins’ landau, in the Bois, on the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away, solitary, crushed,—she must have employed, to draw Forcheville’s attention to him, while she murmured: ‘Do look at him, storming!’ the same glance, brilliant, ma/icious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins’.
但有时，悲伤又会占据他的心。他会想象奥黛特是福什维尔的情妇，当他们俩坐在布瓦维尔迪兰家的四轮大篷车深处注视着他时，在查图举行聚会的前一天晚上，他没有被邀请参加，而他他脸上的绝望表情连他的马车夫都注意到了，恳求她和他一起回家，但徒劳无功，然后转身走开，孤独，沮丧——她一定是用了这个办法，吸引福什维尔的注意力到他身上，而她低声说道：“看他，猛烈的攻击！”同样的眼神，灿烂、恶毒、斜视、狡猾，就像福什维尔把萨尼埃特赶出韦尔迪兰家的那个晚上一样。

At such times Swann detested her. ‘But I’ve been a fool, too,’ he would argue. ‘I’m paying for other men’s pleasures with my money. All the same, she’d better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we’d better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn’t seem particularly keen; she hasn’t said yes or no yet. Let’s hope that she’ll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!’ And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out—as he tried to convince himself—that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter.
在这种时候，斯万厌恶她。 “但我也曾是个傻瓜，”他会争辩道。 “我用我的钱来换取其他男人的快乐。尽管如此，她最好还是小心一点，不要太频繁地拉绳子，因为我很可能会停止给她任何东西。无论如何，我们最好暂时取消额外的恩惠。想一想，就在昨天，当她说她想去拜罗伊特度过这个季节时，我真是个蠢货，竟然提出要为我们两个人提供巴伐利亚国王在那里的那些快乐的小地方之一。但她似乎并没有特别热衷。她还没有说“是”或“不是”。我们希望她会拒绝。天哪！想想和她一起听瓦格纳两周，她对音乐的兴趣就像鱼对小苹果的兴趣一样；他的仇恨，就像他的爱一样，需要在行动中表现出来，他以不断推动他的邪恶想象为乐，因为，由于他指控奥黛特背信弃义，他更加厌恶她，如果事实证明——正如他试图说服自己的那样——她确实犯了这些罪，他就能利用惩罚她的机会，将他满溢的愤怒倾倒在她身上。就这样，他甚至以为他会收到她的一封信，信中她会向他要钱买拜罗伊特的房子，但警告他不要亲自去那里，正如她答应福什维尔和维尔迪兰一家会邀请他们一样。哦，如果她有这样的胆量，他会多么喜欢它。 他会多么高兴地拒绝，起草那封报复性的答复，他通过选择和大声朗诵其中的条款来自娱自乐，就好像他真的收到了她的信一样。

The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would be a bar to his.
第二天，她的信就来了。她写道，维尔迪兰夫妇和他们的朋友表示希望参加瓦格纳的这些演出，如果他愿意给她钱，那么在经常去他们的演出之后，她终于可以了。的房子，有幸在她的房子里招待维尔迪兰一家。关于他，她一句话也没说；人们理所当然地认为，他们在拜罗伊特的存在将成为他的障碍。

Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours.
然后，那个毁灭性的答案，他连夜仔细排练过的每一个字，都没有冒险希望它能被使用，他很满意地把它传达给了她。唉!他非常确定，凭借她所拥有的或可以轻易获得的钱，她将能够在拜罗伊特买一套房子，因为她希望这样做，因为她无法区分巴赫和巴赫。克拉皮松。那么就让她接受吧；她必须更加节俭地生活，仅此而已。没有办法（如果他回复给她寄几千法郎的钞票的话）每天晚上在她租来的城堡里组织那些精致的小晚餐，之后她可能会心血来潮（这，有可能（尚未抓住她）落入福什维尔的怀抱。无论如何，这次令人厌恶的远征，不会是斯旺要付出代价的。啊!如果他能设法阻止这一切，如果她能在出发前扭伤脚踝，如果要送她去车站的马车司机同意（无论贿赂有多大）将她偷偷带到某个地方，这个背信弃义的女人可以被隔离一段时间，她的眼睛里闪烁着与福什维尔同谋的微笑，这就是奥黛特在过去四十八小时里为斯万变成的样子。

But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: ‘Look at him storming!’ began to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: ‘You mustn’t stay long, for this gentleman doesn’t much like my having visitors when he’s here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!’ that same smile with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone.
但她的这种状态并没有持续很长时间。几天后，那双闪闪发亮、狡猾的眼睛失去了亮度和口是心非，那张可恶的奥黛特对福什维尔说：“看看他暴风雨来了！”的画面开始变得苍白并消失。然后，另一个奥黛特的脸渐渐重新出现，在他面前升起，光芒四射，那个奥黛特也微笑着转向福什维尔，但微笑中除了对斯旺的感情之外别无他物，她说： “你不能久留，这位先生不太喜欢我在他这里的时候有访客。哦！如果你像我一样了解这个生物就好了！”她常常带着同样的微笑感谢斯旺的一些礼貌，她非常珍视这种礼貌，感谢她在一次严重危机中向他请教的一些建议。她的生活，当她可以独自转向他时。

Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities.
然后，他会问自己，是什么促使他写了那封令人发指的信，也许，直到那时，她才认为他有能力写这封信，这封信必定使他从高处、从卑微的地位降下来。凭借他的慷慨和忠诚，他在她的尊敬中为自己赢得了至高无上的地位。他对她来说会变得不那么亲切，因为她爱他的正是因为她在福什维尔或其他任何地方都找不到的那些品质。正是为了他们，奥黛特经常向他表示相互的善意，这在他嫉妒的时刻毫无意义，因为这不是相互欲望的标志，实际上是一种感情而不是爱情的证明，但重要性他再次开始感觉到，他的怀疑自然而然地放松了，而阅读有关艺术的书籍或朋友的谈话给他带来的分心往往加速了他的怀疑，使他的热情不再那么严格要求互惠。

Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann’s jealousy had for the moment driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire.
现在，经过这次钟摆的摆动，奥黛特自然地又回到了斯万的嫉妒暂时驱使她离开的地方，从他发现她迷人的角度来看，他在自己心目中的她充满了温柔，带着一种温柔。她的眼神里流露出同意的神情，美丽得让他情不自禁地把嘴唇移向她，就好像她真的在房间里等待他亲吻一样。他对她那迷人而慈祥的目光存有感激之情，那目光强烈得仿佛她真的这样看着他，而这不仅仅是他的想象，为了满足他的欲望而描绘的。

What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own.
他给她带来了多大的痛苦啊！当然，他找到了足够的理由来表达自己的怨恨，但如果他没有如此热烈地爱她，这些理由还不足以让他感到怨恨。他难道没有对其他女人怀有同样严重的不满吗？尽管如此，他今天仍然愿意为她们提供服务，因为他不再爱她们，所以对她们不再感到愤怒？如果有一天他发现自己对奥黛特也处于同样的冷漠状态，那么他就会明白，正是他的嫉妒才导致他在这种欲望中发现了一些残暴的、不可原谅的东西（毕竟，所以一种自然的愿望，源于孩子般的纯真，也源于她天性中的某种微妙），当有机会时，她能够报答维尔迪兰夫妇的热情款待，并在她的房子里扮演女主人自己的。

He returned to the other point of view—opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities—from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him.
他回到了另一种观点——与他的爱和嫉妒的观点相反，他有时出于一种心理上的公平而诉诸这种观点，以便考虑到不同的可能性——他试图从中形成一种奥黛特的新判断，基于这样的假设：他从未爱过她，她对他来说只是一个像其他女人一样的女人，她的生活（当他本人不在场时）没有什么不同，是一种编织的纹理暗中远离他，并与他为敌。

Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness.
为什么相信她会在那里和福什维尔或其他男人一起享受令人陶醉的快乐，而这些快乐是她和他在一起时从未体验过的，而这些快乐都是他的嫉妒在所有元素中制造出来的？在拜罗伊特，就像在巴黎一样，如果福什维尔真的想起了他，那也只会是某个在奥黛特的生命中举足轻重的人，一个他不得不为之让路的人，当他们在她家见面时。如果福什维尔和她不顾他的反对，一起到了那里，取得了胜利，那么正是他徒劳地阻止她去那里，从而取得了胜利，而如果他批准了她的计划，就这一点而言，这是他的计划。完全有道理，她会显得是他的劝告在那里，她会觉得自己被送到那里，被他安置在那里，并且为了她从招待那些经常招待她的人中获得的乐趣，这是为了告诉他她将不得不承认自己的债务。

And if—instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him, without having seen him again—he were to send her this money, if he were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy—the sight of her face—which he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette’s person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in Swann’s life, when the sereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:—this other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it.
如果——而不是让她就这样离开，与他背道而驰，没有再见到他——他应该给她寄这笔钱，如果他鼓励她踏上这段旅程，并且不遗余力地走下去为了让她感到舒适和愉快，她会高兴、感激地跑到他身边，他会感到喜悦——看到她的脸——他已经有近一个星期没有体会过这种喜悦了，这种喜悦是其他任何人都无法替代的。 。当斯万能够毫无反感地描绘出她的形象时，他能再次看到她微笑中的友善，他不再因为嫉妒他的爱而强加将她从每一个对手身边夺走的欲望，爱再次成为一种对奥黛特这个人给他带来的感觉的品味，一种他在欣赏（就像一个奇观）或在质疑（就像一个现象）中发现的快乐，一个人的诞生她的眼神、她的微笑的形成、她说话的语调。这种与其他快乐不同的快乐最终在他心中产生了对她的需要，而只有她，通过她的存在或她的信，才能满足这种需要，几乎与另一种需要一样无私，几乎一样艺术，一样反常。斯万生活中这个新时期的特点是，在前几年的平静和抑郁之后，出现了一种精神上的富足，他不知道自己的生活为何如此丰富，就像一个人在生活中一样。健康脆弱的人从某个时刻开始变得更强壮，长出肉来，一段时间内似乎走上了完全康复的道路：——这种另一种需要，同样是在他身上独立于可见的物质世界而发展起来的，是需要听音乐并学习了解它。

And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile.
因此，通过他的疾病的化学过程，在他出于爱而产生嫉妒之后，他又开始对奥黛特产生温柔和怜悯。她又变成了原来的奥黛特，迷人又善良。他对自己对她的粗暴行为充满了悔恨。他希望她能来找他，而且在她来之前，他希望已经为她谋取了一些快乐，以便看到她的感激之情在她的脸上浮现出来，塑造出她的微笑。

So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which he set most store.
同样，奥黛特也确信几天后他会像以前一样温柔顺从地来到她身边，恳求她和解，她已经习惯了，不再害怕惹他不高兴，甚至生气。 ，只要对她有利，就拒绝他最看重的恩惠。

Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see her again.
也许她没有意识到，在争吵期间，他对她是多么真诚，他告诉她，他不会给她钱，但会尽其所能地伤害她。也许她也没有意识到，他仍然是多么真诚，即使不是对她，至少是对他自己，在其他场合，为了他们未来的关系，向奥黛特表明，他没有她也能做到，考虑到他们之间仍有可能破裂，他决定等一段时间再去见她。

Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested. Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief, again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For, upsetting all Swann’s calculations, Odette’s acceptance had entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old.
有时已经过去好几天了，在此期间她并没有给他带来新的焦虑。因为，从接下来他将拜访她的几次来看，他知道他可能不会得到任何巨大的快乐，但更可能的是，一些烦恼会结束他发现自己的平静状态，他写信给她说，他很忙，在他建议的任何一天都无法见到她。与此同时，她写来一封信，要求他推迟其中一次会议。他问自己，为什么？他的怀疑、他的悲伤再次占据了他的心。他发现自己陷入了新的焦躁状态，他再也无法忍受他在之前相对平静的状态下所做的安排了；他会跑去找她，并坚持在接下来的每一天都要见到她。而就算她没有先写信，只要她承认了他的信，就足以让他见不到她就无法安息。因为，奥黛特的接受打乱了斯万的所有算计，彻底改变了他的态度。就像每个拥有贵重物品的人一样，为了知道如果他暂时停止拥有它会发生什么，他将贵重物品从他的脑海中分离出来，正如他所想的那样，让其他一切都保持在原来的状态。那里。但是，整体中某个部分的缺席不仅如此，它不仅仅是部分的遗漏，它是所有其他部分的干扰，一种从旧的状态中无法预见的新状态。

But at other times—when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday—it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks’ separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,—by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday—suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were ‘ordinary’ or ‘preference’ shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),—and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities.
但在其他时候——当奥黛特要出去度假时——他选择借口进行一些琐碎的争吵后，决定不给她写信，也不去看她，直到她回来为止。严重破裂的出现（并期待着回报），她也许会认为这是最终的分离，其中大部分是不可避免的，因为她要离开，而事实上，他只是允许分离开始比必须早一点。他立刻就能想象奥黛特因既没有收到他的来访，也没有收到他的来信而感到困惑、焦虑和苦恼，而她的这张照片平息了他的嫉妒，使他很容易改掉见到她的习惯。毫无疑问，在奇怪的时刻，在他大脑的最深处，他的决心把它推开了，并且由于间隔的长度，他同意的三个星期的分离，他很高兴能够考虑一下奥黛特回来后他会再次见到她的想法；但他也没有那么不耐烦，开始问自己是否不会欣然同意将如此轻松的禁欲期加倍。到目前为止，这种情况只持续了三天，比他以前见不到奥黛特的时间要短得多，也没有像这次那样预先计划好分离。 然而，时不时地，他的思想中出现了一些微小的矛盾迹象，或者他的身体出现了弱点，——通过煽动他将现在视为一个特殊的时刻，一个不受规则约束的时刻，一个需要谨慎本身的时刻。允许他利用快乐的舒缓效果，并给他的意志（直到其努力可能达到任何目的的那一刻到来）放假——暂停他的意志的行动，停止发挥其抑制性控制；或者，即使没有这个，他也想到了一些他忘记问奥黛特的信息，比如她是否已经决定将她的马车重新漆成什么颜色，或者，关于某些投资，它们是否“普通”或者她希望他购买的“优先”股（因为向她表明他可以在没有见到她的情况下生活，这很好，但如果在那之后，马车必须重新粉刷，如果股票不产生股息） ，他本来会做很多好事），突然之间，就像一根被拉伸的橡皮筋被松开，或者气动机器中的空气被撕开，从遥远的地方再次见到她的想法在它所依附的时间里，跳回到当下和直接可能性的领域。

It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to have any place in Swann’s mind since, having proved to himself—or so, at least, he believed—that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an Odette almost unknown.
它就这样弹了回来，没有遇到任何进一步的阻力，事实上，如此不可抗拒，以至于斯万在看着他必须与奥黛特分开的两周逐渐临近结束时，远不如他被保留时那么不高兴。等了十分钟，他的马车夫才把要带他去见她的马车驶过来，他在焦急和喜悦中度过了这几分钟，在这几分钟里，他重新抓住了一千次，把他所有的感情财富都挥霍在这上面，他与奥黛特会面的想法，在他以为那是那么遥远的时刻，由于如此突然的反应，它再次出现并出现在他的意识的表面。事实上，这个想法不再成为其进程中的障碍，不再拖延地想办法抵制它的到来，从那时起，这种愿望在斯万的脑海中就不再占有任何位置，已经向他自己证明了——或者说，在至少，他相信，他很容易就能抵制它，他不再认为推迟分离计划有任何不便，现在他确信只要他愿意，就可以实施该计划。此外，再次见到她的念头再次出现在他的脑海中，带着一种新奇、一种诱惑、一种毒力，所有这些长期的习惯都已经衰弱了，但在这段时间的匮乏中，这一切都获得了新的活力，不是三天的，而是一整天的。两周（禁欲期可以通过预期来计算，因为它已经持续到指定的最后日期），并将在此之前一直存在的、很容易被牺牲的快乐转变为一种意想不到的幸福，他无力抗拒。 最后，这个想法又回到了他的脑海中，由于他自己不知道奥黛特在发现他没有生命迹象时可能会想到什么，可能会做什么，因此他现在要去见那个人。令人着迷的揭露一个几乎不为人知的奥黛特。

But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came, now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann’s love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable, or indeed possible.
但是，正如她以为他拒绝给她寄钱只是一种佯攻，她在他现在问她的问题中只看到了一个借口，关于重新粉刷她的马车，或者购买股票。 。因为她无法重建他所经历的这些危机的几个阶段，而且在她对这些危机形成的一般概念中，她没有试图理解它们的机制，只关注她事先知道的东西，它们是必要的、永不失败的和始终相同的终止。这是一个不完美的想法（尽管结果可能更加深刻），如果有人从斯旺的角度来判断它，他无疑会认为奥黛特无法理解他，就像吗啡狂症或痨病患者一样，每个人都说服了他。他感到自己被击退了，一是在他正要摆脱自己根深蒂固的习惯的那一刻，被一些外部事件所击退，二是在他即将最终痊愈的那一刻，由于意外的不适，他感到他自己被医生误解了，他对这些假装的偶然事件并没有同样的重视，据他说，这些假装的偶然事件只是一种伪装，为了让他的病人能够察觉，一个人的恶习和另一个人的病态状态，事实上，当他们正在酝酿着正常和健康的梦想时，这些问题一直沉重地、无法治愈地压在他们身上。事实上，斯万的爱已经达到了这样的阶段：医生和（在某些感情的情况下）最大胆的外科医生都扪心自问，是否要剥夺病人的恶习，或者根除他的疾病。合理的，或者确实可能的。

Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge. When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded complexion, returned on certain days. ‘Really, I am making distinct headway,’ he would tell himself on the morrow, ‘when I come to think it over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out of being in bed with her; it’s an odd thing, but I actually thought her ugly.’ And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette’s person, indeed, no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, ‘It is she!’ as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. ‘She?’—he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp—the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann’s love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation.
当然，斯万对这种爱的程度没有直接的了解。当他试图测量它时，有时他会发现它缩小了，几乎缩小到了零。例如，在他爱上奥黛特之前的几天里，他对她富有表现力的面容和苍白的肤色有一种非常温和的喜欢，几乎达到了不喜欢的程度，但在某些日子里，这种喜欢又回来了。 “真的，我正在取得明显的进展，”第二天他会告诉自己，“当我仔细考虑一下时，我发现昨晚和她在床上我几乎没有得到任何快乐;这很奇怪，但我实际上觉得她很丑。”当然他是真诚的，但他的爱远远超出了肉体欲望的范畴。确实，奥黛特这个人在其中不再占有任何重要地位。当他的目光落在桌子上奥黛特的照片上时，或者当她来看他时，他很难辨认出她的脸，无论是在肉体还是在纸板上，他的脑海里充满了痛苦和持续的焦虑。他几乎惊讶地对自己说：“是她！”就像突然有人以一种超然的、外化的形式向我们展示我们自己的一种弊病，而我们却发现它与我们所遭受的痛苦毫无相似之处。 “她？”——他试图问自己这是什么意思；因为它就像爱，就像死亡（而不是那些模糊的疾病概念），是一种人们不断质疑的东西，以便让自己进一步探究它，因为担心这个问题找不到答案，实质内容将逃脱我们的掌握——人格之谜。 而这种病，就是斯万的爱，迄今为止已经成倍增长，与他所有的习惯、他所有的行为、他的思想、他的健康、他的睡眠、他的生活，甚至与他死后的希望紧密地交织在一起。 ，与他完全合而为一，以至于在不几乎完全摧毁他的情况下将其夺走是不可能的；正如外科医生所说，他的病例已经过手术了。

By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette’s eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants’ liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of ‘young Swann,’ as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, ‘every fruit visited and examined, one by one, by myself.’ And ii the sequel, by the cordiality with which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most of all, that ‘every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself’ had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which he rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the ‘right places’ and the art of ordering things from shops.
由于这种爱，斯旺已经远离了所有其他兴趣，以至于当他偶然重新出现在时尚界时，提醒自己他的社会关系就像一个精美的环境（尽管她无法形成任何非常精确的环境）。在奥黛特的眼中，也许仍然会增加一点他自己的价值（事实上，如果他们没有被他的爱本身贬低的话，他们可能会这样做，对奥黛特来说，他的爱本身贬低了它所触及的一切，似乎在谴责这种爱）在她不认识的地方和人中间感到痛苦的同时，他会在那里感受到同样超然的快乐感，就像他从一本小说或一幅画中得到的那样描绘了有闲阶级的娱乐；就像在家里一样，他常常享受着他的家庭的顺利效率、他自己的衣柜和仆人的制服的漂亮、他的投资的稳健性，就像他在圣彼得堡读到的书一样津津有味。西蒙是他最喜欢的作家之一，他的著作《凡尔赛宫的日常生活机械》是由西蒙女士撰写的。曼特农吃吃喝喝，或者鲁利精明的贪婪和盛大的排场。在某种程度上，这种超然不是绝对的，斯万之所以能尝到这种新的快乐，是因为他可以暂时移居到自己的那些少数而遥远的部分，而这些部分对他的爱和他的爱来说几乎是陌生的。疼痛。在这方面，我的曾祖母赋予他的“年轻的斯旺”的个性，与查尔斯·斯旺更加个性化的个性不同，是他现在最高兴的。 有一次，因为那天是帕尔马公主的生日（而且因为她经常可以间接地为奥黛特派上用场，让她有座位参加晚会和周年庆之类的事情），他决定派人去他给她一篮子水果，不太确定在哪里或如何订购，他把这个任务委托给了他母亲的一个表弟，她很高兴为他做一份委托，写信给他，强调了这一事实她并没有在同一个地方选择所有的水果，而是来自克拉波特的葡萄，它们是这里的特产，来自若雷的草莓，来自切维的梨，他们总是有最好的，很快，“每一种水果都经过了检查和检查”一个接一个，我一个人。”接下来，通过公主对他的诚挚谢意，他已经能够判断出草莓的味道和梨子的成熟度了。但是，最重要的是，“我一个人拜访过的每一个水果和一个接一个的考生”都让他的思绪转移到了一个他很少去的地方，这给他的痛苦带来了安慰，尽管这是他作为继承人的权利。一个富裕而受人尊敬的中产阶级家庭，世代相传“正确地点”的知识和从商店订购商品的艺术。

Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was ‘young Swann’ not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times—when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than ‘young Swann,’ was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had ‘kept up’ with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother’s wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann.
事实上，他已经忘记了自己是“年轻的斯万”，当他再次扮演这个角色的时候，他不会感受到比其他时候更强烈的快乐——事实上，当他长大了的时候厌倦了快乐；如果说中产阶级人民的友善程度不如贵族阶级那么热情（尽管对他们来说，他只是“年轻的斯旺”，但更受人奉承，因为在中产阶级心目中，友谊更重要）与尊重是分不开的），对于斯旺来说，没有任何一封来自王室人士的来信，为他提供一些王室娱乐，这封信要求他作为见证人，或者仅仅出席某人家庭的婚礼。父母的老朋友；他们中的一些人一直“跟上”他，比如我的祖父，在这些事件的前一年，他邀请他参加我母亲的婚礼，而其他人几乎不认识他，但他们认为，有责任表明对儿子、对已故斯旺先生的当之无愧的继承人的礼貌。

But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Françoise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one’s idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind’s eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,—since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins’ ‘faithful,’—when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily.
但是，由于他与众多时尚界人士的亲密关系由来已久，从某种意义上说，他们也是他的房子、他的服务和他的家庭的一部分。当他的思想停留在他辉煌的关系上时，他感到同样的外部支持，同样的坚实的安慰，就像当他看到他的祖先留给他的精美庄园，精美的银子，精美的桌布一样。想到如果他突然生病并被限制在家里，他的贴身男仆会本能地跑去寻找沙特尔公爵、罗伊斯亲王、卢森堡公爵和夏吕斯男爵。 ，给他带来了同样的安慰，就像我们的老弗朗索瓦丝一样，她知道有一天，她会穿着自己漂亮的衣服被埋葬，上面写着她的名字，根本没有缝补（或者缝补得如此精美，以至于它只是增强了人们对裁缝师的技艺和耐心），这件裹尸布从她脑海中的持续形象中汲取了某种令人满意的感觉，即使不是真正的财富和繁荣，至少是自尊。 但最重要的是——因为在他的每一个行动和想法中，都与奥黛特有关，斯万不断地被一种未承认的感觉所征服和动摇，即他对她来说，也许并不比任何人都不那么可爱，但至少不那么受欢迎，即使是维尔迪兰家族中最令人厌烦的“忠实者”，当他进入一个自己是品味至高典范的世界，一个不遗余力地吸引他的人，一个人们真诚地遗憾没有见到他的人时，他再次开始相信更幸福的生活的存在，几乎对它产生了兴趣，就像一个病人在床上躺了几个月并严格节食时，当他拿起报纸并阅读有关官方宴会或环西西里岛游轮的广告。

If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann’s accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann’s house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, ‘I am always free’ and ‘What can it matter to me, what other people think?’ now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: ‘Ah, he! He is not in the least like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his friendship for me. He’s not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public.’ This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. ‘I should like to speak to you about her,’ he went on, ‘you, who know what a woman supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn’t see Odette in the light in which you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won’t even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn’t you say a few words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her?’
如果说他不得不向他那些时髦的朋友们找借口不去拜访他们，那么他也正是因为拜访了她才向奥黛特找借口。他仍然付钱给他们（每个月月底都会问自己，鉴于他可能已经耗尽了她的耐心，并且肯定经常去看她，他是否给她寄四千法郎就足够了），并且为每个这次拜访他找到了一个借口，一件他必须给她带来的礼物，一些她需要的信息，德·夏吕斯先生，他曾见过德·夏吕斯先生实际上要去她家，而且他坚持要斯万陪他一起去。而且，如果没有任何借口，他会请求德·夏吕斯先生立即去找她，并在谈话过程中，仿佛自发地告诉她，他刚刚想起了一些他必须对斯万说的事情，并且请她给斯万家发个口信，请他当场到她那里来；好吗？但斯万通常在家里等待，但没有结果，德·夏吕斯先生在晚上晚些时候告诉他，他的装置没有成功。结果，如果她现在经常离开巴黎，即使她在那里，他也几乎看不到她。当她爱上他时，她常常说：“我总是自由的”和“别人怎么想对我来说有什么关系？”现在，每当他想见她时，她都会诉诸礼数或请求参与。当他谈到要参加慈善娱乐活动，或私人聚会，或她要出席的第一晚时，她会劝说他希望在公共场合宣传他们的关系，他把她当作一个女人来对待。街头。 事情发展到了这样的程度，为了避免自己在任何地方都被禁止与她见面，斯旺想起她认识我的叔叔阿道夫，并且对他怀有深深的依恋，而他本人也是阿道夫的朋友。那天去他位于贝勒查斯街的小公寓里见他，请他利用自己的影响力来影响奥黛特。碰巧的是，当她向斯旺谈到我叔叔时，她总是用一种诗意的语气说：“啊，他！他一点也不像你；他一点也不像你。他对我的友谊是一件精致、伟大、美丽的事情。 “他不是那种不关心我、在公共场合随处可见的人。”这让斯万很尴尬，他不知道自己该用什么样的言辞来谈论这个问题。奥黛特对我叔叔说。他首先提到了她的卓越性、先验性、她天使般的超人性的公理、她无法表达的美德的启示，这些美德是不可能形成的。 “我想和你谈谈她，”他继续说道，“你知道奥黛特是一个多么至高无上的女人，一个多么可爱的存在，一个多么天使般的奥黛特。但你也知道巴黎的生活是什么。每个人都不会以你我有幸见到她的眼光来看待奥黛特。所以有人认为我的行为相当愚蠢；她甚至不允许我在户外、在剧院见到她。现在你，她对你有如此巨大的信心，你就不能替我对她说几句话，只是为了向她保证，她夸大了我在街上向她鞠躬可能对她造成的伤害吗？’

My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet he; everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette’s lover, had left Swann dumb foundered. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral ‘lightness,’ of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a ‘gay’ life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon’s Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the Côte d’Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: ‘You do look sad!’ It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being ‘kept’; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Crécy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the ‘ladies’ men’ of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: ‘What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Crécy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they’re true, are always based upon other people’s ideas”; he would reflect that this legend—even if it were authentic—was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun’s setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golde; tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable t restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: ‘So that is how yo thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I wa being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!’ Sometime ... at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew—if only indirectly—the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations.
我叔叔建议斯万几天内不要见到奥黛特，之后她会更加爱他；他建议奥黛特让斯万来见他；任何地方，只要他高兴就可以。几天后，奥黛特告诉斯万，她刚刚猛然惊醒。她发现我叔叔和其他男人一样；他曾试图通过殴打的方式带走她。她让斯旺平静下来，斯旺一开始还想冲出去挑战我叔叔决斗，但当他们再次见面时，他拒绝与他握手。他对这次决裂更加感到遗憾，因为他希望，如果他有时能再次见到我叔叔阿道夫，并设法与他在严格保密的情况下交谈，能够让他澄清有关某些谣言。奥黛特过去在尼斯过的生活。因为我叔叔阿道夫过去常常在那里过冬，斯旺认为他可能确实就是在那里第一次认识奥黛特的。有人在他耳边说了几句话，说的是一个似乎是奥黛特情人的男人，这让斯旺哑口无言。但是，在他知道之前，他认为最可怕、最不可能相信的事情，一旦他知道了，却永远融入了他的悲伤之中。他承认了它们，但他无法再理解它们的不存在。只是，他们每个人在走过的过程中都留下了不可磨灭的痕迹，改变了他对情妇的印象。 事实上，他一度觉得自己能够理解，这种道德上的“轻松”，他永远不会怀疑奥黛特，是众所周知的，而且在巴登或尼斯，当她过去花几个小时在某个地方呆了几个月，她就享有一种多情的恶名。为了质问他们，他试图再次与某些具有这种特征的人取得联系；但他并没有这样做。但他们知道他认识奥黛特，此外，他害怕让他们想起她，害怕让他们再次追随她的脚步。 但对他来说，直到那时，没有什么比巴登或尼斯的国际化生活更乏味的了，现在他得知奥黛特也许曾经在那些地方过着“同性恋”的生活。快乐的城市，尽管他永远无法弄清楚这是否仅仅是为了满足她不再感到的对金钱的渴望，或者是出于某种反复无常的本能，这种本能随时可能在她身上复活，他会在麦克马洪的《七十年代》的早期，他在无底的深渊中瘦身，在无能为力的痛苦中，盲目和头晕，在这个无底深渊中，他自己的那些年被吞没了，在那里，人们在英国大道上度过了冬天，在下面度过了夏天巴登的石灰岩，在那些年里会发现一种悲伤但灿烂的深刻性，就像诗人借给他们的那样；如果这能帮助他理解那些仍然让他在微笑或眼中感到困惑的东西，他会致力于重建那些日子里构成蔚蓝海岸日常巡游的所有无关紧要的细节。奥黛特，比那些翻遍十五世纪佛罗伦萨现存文献、试图进一步深入《春》、《美丽的万娜》或《波提切利的维纳斯》的灵魂的美学家更加热情。他常常坐着，不跟她说一句话，只是凝视着她，做着梦。她会评论道：‘你看上去确实很悲伤！” 不久之后，他从认为她是一位优秀的人，可以与他所认识的最好的女人相媲美的想法转变为“保留”她；然而，通过相反的过程，他已经从奥黛特·德·克雷西（也许对度假者来说太熟悉了）回到了尼斯和巴登的“女士”男人，回到了这张脸，脸上的表情如此往往是温柔的，对于这种本性来说是如此的人性。他会问自己：“说到底，尼斯的每个人都知道奥黛特·德·克雷西是谁，这意味着什么？”这类声誉，即使是真实的，也总是基于其他人的想法”；他会反思，这个传说——即使它是真实的——对奥黛特来说是外在的东西，并不是她固有的顽皮和根深蒂固的性格；那个可能被引入歧途的生物是一个眼神坦率的女人，一颗对他人苦难充满怜悯的心，一个被他紧紧抱在怀里用手指探索的温顺的身体，一个他可能会拥有的女人。如果有一天他成功地使自己成为她不可或缺的一部分，那么有一天他就会完全占有她。她在那里，经常很累，她的脸因对未知事物的热切、狂热的关注而显得空白，这让斯万痛苦不已。她会用双手把头发向后梳；她的额头，整个脸似乎都变大了；然后，突然间，一些普通人的思想，一些有价值的情感，就像所有生物在休息或冥想时可以自由表达自己一样，会像一道金光一样从她的眼睛里闪现出来。 立刻，她的整张脸都亮了起来，就像一片灰色的风景，被云层包裹着，突然，在太阳落山的那一刻，云层被一扫而空，沉闷的景象变形了。奥黛特此时的生活，甚至她似乎在做梦的未来，斯万都可以与她分享。似乎没有任何邪恶的干扰对他们产生任何影响。尽管这些时刻变得罕见，但它们并没有白白发生。通过记忆的过程，斯旺将这些碎片连接在一起，消除了它们之间的间隔，像用熔化的金子一样铸造了奥黛特契约的形象，它充满了仁慈和宁静，他稍后将为她制作（正如我们将看到的）在这个故事的第二部分）其他奥黛特永远无法从他那里赢得的牺牲。但那些时刻是多么罕见，他现在也很少见到她了！即使是晚上的聚会，她也不会在最后一刻才告诉他她是否能够见到他，因为考虑到他总是有空，她首先希望确定没有其他人愿意来参加。她。她会辩称，她必须等待一个非常重要的答复，即使在她让斯万来她家之后，如果她的任何朋友在晚上中途邀请她加入在某个剧院里，或者晚饭后，她会高兴得跳起来，飞快地穿衣服。 随着她上厕所的进展，她所做的每一个动作都让斯万更接近不得不与她分开的时刻，那时她会以不可抗拒的力量飞走；但他却无法忍受。当她终于准备好时，她对着镜子最后看了一眼，因为她渴望好看，所以紧张而明亮，在嘴唇上涂了一点药膏，把一缕头发固定在额头上，然后叫来了她的斗篷。带有金色的天蓝色丝绸；如果斯旺挂着流苏，他就会显得那么可怜，以至于她会无法克制地做出不耐烦的举动，冲向他：“这就是你感谢我让你留在这里直到最后一刻的方式！”我以为我对你很好。好吧，下次我会更清楚的！”有时……冒着惹恼她的风险，他下定决心要找出她去了哪里，甚至梦想与福什维尔结成防御联盟，福什维尔也许有能够告诉他。但无论如何，当他知道她和谁一起度过这个夜晚时，他很少无法在他无数的熟人中找到一个认识（即使只是间接认识）与她一起出去的男人的人，并且能够认识她。轻松获得有关他的这样或那样的信息。当他写信给他的一位朋友，请他尝试对某个问题或其他问题做出一点说明时，当他不再用没有答案的问题困扰自己并转移到另一些人则面临着审讯的压力。诚然，斯万对于他所收到的这些信息并没有多少了解。 了解一件事并不总是能让我们阻止它的发生，但毕竟我们知道的事情即使不在我们手中，至少也在我们的脑海中，我们可以根据自己的选择处置它们，这给了我们一种可以控制它们的力量的错觉。每当德·夏吕斯先生和奥黛特在一起时，他就非常高兴。他知道德·夏吕斯先生和她之间绝不会发生什么不愉快的事情，德·夏吕斯先生和她去任何地方都是出于对他自己的友谊，他会毫不费力地告诉他她所做的一切。 。有时她会如此坚决地向斯旺宣布，他不可能在某个特定的晚上见到她，她似乎非常热切地期待着某种郊游，以致斯旺非常重视德·夏吕斯先生的存在这一事实。有空陪她。第二天，他不敢向德·夏吕斯先生提出很多问题，但他会表现得不太明白他的第一个答案，强迫他回答更多问题，之后每回答一个问题，他就会感到自己越来越放心，因为他很快就明白了。得知奥黛特在最天真无邪的放荡中度过了她的夜晚。

‘But what do you mean, my dear Mémé, I don’t quite understand.... You didn’t go straight from her house to the Musée Grévin? Surely you went somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don’t know how amusing you are, my dear Mémé. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That’s strange. After all, it wasn’t a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Mémé; I’m exceedingly fond of you.’
“但是你的意思是，我亲爱的梅梅，我不太明白……你没有直接从她家去格雷万蜡像馆吗？”你肯定先去了别的地方吧？不？这很奇怪！你不知道你有多有趣，我亲爱的梅梅。但事后她继续参加“黑色聊天”，这是多么奇怪的想法啊！我想这是她的主意吧？不？你的？真奇怪。毕竟，这并不是一个坏主意。她在那里肯定认识几十个人吧？不？她从来没有跟任何人说过话？多么非凡啊！然后你们就这样坐在那里，只有你和她，就你们两个人吗？我可以想象你坐在那里！你是一个值得尊敬的人，我亲爱的梅梅；我非常喜欢你。

Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, ‘I saw Mme. de Crécy yesterday; she was with a man I didn’t know.’), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,—how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: ‘She didn’t know a soul; she never spoke to a soul.’ How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery.
斯旺现在很轻松。对他来说，经常发生这样的情况：当他与对他的爱一无所知的朋友、他几乎不听的朋友交谈时，听到某些超然的句子（例如，“我昨天见到了德·克雷西夫人；她和他在一起”）。一个我不认识的人。”），这些句子落入他的心里，立刻凝固成固体，变得像石笋一样坚硬，把他烧焦了，撕裂了，因为它们躺在那儿，无法移动，——相比之下，多么迷人，是这样的话：“她不认识任何人；她从不跟任何人说话。”它们在他体内流淌得多么自由，多么流畅，多么飘逸，多么容易呼吸！然而，过了一会儿，他告诉自己，如果奥黛特更喜欢这些而不是他的陪伴，她一定会觉得他很无聊。而它们的微不足道，虽然让他放心，却让他痛苦，仿佛她对它们的享受是一种背叛的行为。

Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette’s presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: ‘This is delightful; I’m becoming neurasthenic.’ After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle.
即使他无法发现她去了哪里，也足以减轻他当时感到的痛苦，因为奥黛特的存在，她的陪伴的魅力，是唯一的特殊性（从长远来看，这种特殊性是有用的，就像如果奥黛特只允许他在她外出时留在她的房子里，等待她回来的那一刻，那就足够了，他的寂静与安宁将流淌进他的内心，在那里，所有关于那段时光的记忆都被混合和迷失了，这些记忆被一些巫术、一些被诅咒的咒语使他想象为，不知何故，与其他人不同。但她不会；他必须回家；一路上他强迫自己制定各种计划，不再去想奥黛特。他甚至在脱衣服的时候，脑子里翻腾着各种快乐的想法：他怀着轻松的心情，期待着明天去看一些最喜欢的艺术作品，于是他跳进了房间。睡觉并关掉灯；但他一准备睡觉，放松了他自己都没有意识到的自我控制，这已经成为一种习惯，一阵冰冷的颤抖使他的身体抽搐起来，他突然抽泣起来。他也不知为何，只是擦干眼睛，笑道：“这真是令人高兴；我变得神经衰弱了。”此后，他一想到第二天他必须重新开始尝试找出奥黛特一直在做什么，必须利用他所有的影响力设法见到她，他就无法摆脱彻底的疲惫。 。 这种对没有休息、没有变化、没有结果的活动的强迫是一种如此残酷的祸害，以至于有一天，他注意到胃部肿胀，想到自己可能患有致命的肿瘤，他感到一种真正的喜悦。 ，他不需要再关心任何事情，他的疾病将主宰他的生活，让他成为一个玩物，直到不远的终点。如果说，在这个时期，他常常渴望死亡，尽管他自己也没有承认，但与其说是为了逃避痛苦的尖锐，不如说是为了逃避斗争的单调。

And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him.
然而他还是希望能活到他不再爱她的那一天，那时她没有理由对他撒谎，到最后他可以从她那里得知，在他去看她的那天，他是否下午，她有没有在福什维尔的怀里。常常连续几天怀疑她爱上了别人，这会分散他的注意力，让他不再关心福什维尔的问题，使这对他来说几乎无关紧要，就像持续的健康状况不佳的新发展一样，这似乎是一种持续的不良健康状况的新发展。没有多少时间把我们从他们的前辈手中解救出来。甚至有些日子他也没有受到任何怀疑的折磨。他以为自己已经痊愈了。但第二天早上，当他醒来时，他在同一个地方感到同样的疼痛，这种感觉在前一天，可以说被不同印象的洪流冲淡了。但它并没有离开它的位置。确实，正是这种剧烈的疼痛，让他清醒了过来。

Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to ‘the day when I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,’ if, when he felt unwell and had thought, ‘Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,’ he remembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an ‘Oh, no! It’s not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can’t be accepted and are declined in advance.’ And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann’s jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: ‘That’s a gentleman who was in my friend’s box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,’ that explanation would set Swann’s suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrified all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by. Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely.
由于奥黛特从未向他透露过那些每天占用她大量时间的极其重要的事情的信息（尽管他在世上生活了足够长的时间，知道这些事情只不过是快乐），所以他无法坚持下去任何时间长度的努力去想象它们；他的大脑会变得一片空白；然后他会把一根手指放在疲惫的眼睑上，就像他擦拭眼镜一样，然后完全停止思考。然而，在这片未曾探索过的土地上，某些职业时不时地出现，奥黛特模糊地把这些职业与对远房亲戚或老朋友的某种义务联系起来，因为他们是她唯一习惯提到的人。在斯旺看来，阻止她见到他似乎构成了她生活中必要的、不可改变的环境。因为她时不时提到“我和朋友去竞技场的那一天”的语气，如果他感到不舒服并想到“也许奥黛特会好心来看我” ，”他突然记起，就在那些日子里，他会用“哦，不！”来纠正自己。邀请她来是不值得的；我早该想到的，今天是她和朋友去竞技场的日子。我们必须把自己限制在可能的范围内； “我们没有必要浪费时间去提出那些不能被接受和提前拒绝的事情。”而奥黛特肩负的去竞技场的职责，斯万因此让位给了他，在他看来，这不仅仅是本身是不可避免的；但它所烙印的必然性似乎使得一切与它有遥远联系的事物都变得合理和合法。 如果奥黛特在街上向路人行礼致意，这引起了斯旺的嫉妒，那么她在回答他的问题时，就会把这个陌生人与她经常谈到的两三个最重要的职责联系起来。他;例如，如果她说：“那是一位绅士，那天在我朋友的包厢里；”和我一起去竞技场的那个人，”这个解释让斯万打消了疑虑。毕竟，这位朋友在竞技场的包厢里不可避免地会遇到除奥黛特以外的其他客人，但他从未试图或成功地对他们形成任何连贯的印象。哦！他多么想认识她，那个去竞技场的朋友，他多么想她邀请他和奥黛特一起去那里。他多么乐意为了一个习惯见到奥黛特的人而牺牲他所有的熟人，无论她是美甲师还是商店里的女孩。与皇后相比，他会为他们付出更多的麻烦，花费更多的费用。难道他们不会根据他们对奥黛特生活的了解，为他提供一种有效的止痛剂来缓解他的痛苦吗？如果他赶紧去和奥杰特保持着友好关系的那些卑微的人中的一个或另一个一起度过他的日子，他会感到多么高兴，要么是出于某种不可告人的动机，要么是出于真正的纯朴本性。他多么愿意把自己的住所永远固定在某个肮脏但令人羡慕的房子的阁楼上，奥黛特去过那里，但从未带他去，如果他和那个退休的小裁缝住在一起，他很乐意假装是他的情人。 ，他会被拜访过。奥黛特几乎每天都这样。 在那些几乎是贫民窟的地区，生活多么简朴，可以说是卑微，但令人愉快，充满了宁静和幸福，他会同意无限期地领导。

It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette’s face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: ‘My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write.’ (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying ‘my’ and ‘mine’ when she referred to him: ‘You are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,’ nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: ‘You know, you will never be like other people!’—she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: ‘He’s not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!’ and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh:
有时又会发生这种情况，当她见到斯万后，看到一个他不认识的男人走近时，他可以从奥黛特脸上看出她脸上的悲伤表情，那天他来福什维尔的时候她就露出了悲伤的表情。在那里。但这种情况很少见。因为，在那些日子里，尽管她必须做所有的事情，而且她害怕人们会怎么想，但她确实设法见到了斯万，现在她态度中的主要品质是自信；因为，在那些日子里，她的态度中最主要的品质是自信；因为，在那些日子里，尽管她必须做所有的事情，而且她害怕人们会怎么想，但她确实设法见到了斯旺，现在，她态度中的主要品质是自信。一种鲜明的对比，也许是一种无意识的报复，也许是一种胆怯情绪的自然反应，在他们友谊的早期，她在他面前，甚至在他不在的时候，都感受到了这种胆怯的情绪，当她开始写给他的信时，她用”亲爱的，我的手在颤抖，我几乎无法写字。”（至少她是这么假装的，而且这种情感中一定有一点是真诚的，否则她就不会急于放大和强调它。 ）所以斯万当时对她很满意。我们的双手不会颤抖，除非是为了我们自己，或者是为了我们所爱的人。当他们不再控制我们的幸福时，我们在他们面前会变得多么平静、多么轻松、多么勇敢！在跟他说话时，在现在给他写信时，她不再使用那些她试图让自己产生他属于她的幻觉的词语，从而在提到他时创造了说“我的”和“我的”的机会： “你是我在这个世界上的全部；这是我们友谊的芬芳，我会保留它，”也没有对他谈论未来，谈论死亡本身，就像谈论他们必须分享的一次冒险一样。那时候，无论他对她说什么，她都会钦佩地回答：“你知道，你永远不会像别人一样！””——她会凝视着他那长长的、略显秃顶的脑袋，那些只知道他的成功的人过去常常这样想：“如果你愿意的话，他通常不好看，但他很聪明；那一簇头发，那副眼镜，那笑容！’也许更多的是出于好奇，想了解他的真实面目，而不是成为他的情妇，她会叹息道：

‘I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!’
“我真希望我能知道你脑子里装的是什么！”

But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: ‘Ah! so you never will be like other people!’
但现在，无论他说什么，她都会用时而恼怒时而宽容的语气回答：‘啊！所以你永远不会像其他人一样！

She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme, or the ‘likenesses’ in a child whose family one has known: ‘He’s not positively ugly, if you like, but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!’ realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which divides, at a few months’ interval, the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold’s), and would say:
她会凝视着他的头，他的头几乎没有因为最近的焦虑而变老（尽管现在人们这样想，通过同样的心理过程，人们可以发现一首交响乐的含义，而人们已经阅读了一首交响乐的节目） ，或者一个已知家庭的孩子的“相似之处”：“如果你愿意的话，他并不丑陋，但他确实相当荒谬；那副眼镜，那一簇头发，那笑容！”在暗示的滋养下，他们在想象中意识到，每隔几个月，将热心情人的头与戴绿帽子的头分开的看不见的边界），并且会说：

‘Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of yours.’
‘哦，我真希望我能改变你；让你的头脑变得有些道理。

Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only Odette’s way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling himself greedily upon her words: ‘You can if you like,’ he would tell her.
他总是准备好相信他所希望的真理，如果只是奥黛特对他的行为方式留下了怀疑的余地，他就会贪婪地投入到她的话中：“如果你愿意，就可以，”他会告诉她。

And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is only fair to add that in those other women’s hands the noble task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. ‘If she didn’t love me, just a little,’ he told himself, ‘she would not wish to have me altered. To alter me, she will have to see me more often.’ And so he was able to trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann’s orders which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: ‘Don’t have him again when you come to me,’ just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to him:
他试图向她解释，安慰他、控制他、让他工作将是一项崇高的任务，许多其他女人所要求的就是被允许全身心投入，尽管这对她来说是公平的。补充说，在其他女人手中，在斯旺看来，这项崇高的任务只不过是对他行动自由的轻率和无法容忍的侵犯。 “如果她不爱我，哪怕只是一点点，”他告诉自己，“她就不会希望我被改变。”为了改变我，她必须更经常地见到我。”因此，他能够在她在他身上发现的这些缺点中找到至少她的兴趣，甚至可能是她的爱的证据；事实上，现在她给他的东西太少了，以至于他不得不把她时不时禁止他做的各种事情视为她对他感兴趣的证据。有一天，她宣布她不喜欢他的车夫，她认为他可能在让斯万与她作对，而且无论如何，他并没有表现出她希望看到的对斯万命令的迅速和尊重。她觉得他想听她说：“当你来找我时，不要再拥有他”，就像他可能希望她吻他一样。于是，她心情很好，就这么说了；他深受感动。那天晚上，当他与德·夏吕斯先生交谈时，他很高兴能够公开谈论她（因为他现在所说的最琐碎的言论，即使是对那些从未听说过她的人，总是有某种提到奥黛特），他对他说：

‘I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and she certainly takes an interest in what I do.’
“尽管如此，我相信她爱我；她现在对我很好，而且她当然对我所做的事情感兴趣。”

And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said: ‘Hullo! that isn’t Loredan on the box?’ with what melancholy joy would Swann answer him:
如果，当他出发去她家，和一位朋友一起坐上马车时，他的朋友会在途中某个地方送他，他的朋友会说：“哈啰！”盒子上不是洛雷丹吗？”斯万会带着多么忧郁的喜悦回答他：

‘Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren’t take Loredan when I go to the Rue La Pérouse; Odette doesn’t like me to have Loredan, she thinks he doesn’t suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I’ve only to take Rémi there; I should never hear the last of it!’
'哦！天哪，不！我可以告诉你，我去拉佩鲁斯街时不敢带洛雷丹；奥黛特不喜欢我有洛雷丹，她认为他不适合我。一个人到底该做什么？女人，你知道，女人。我亲爱的朋友，她一定会生气的。哦，主啊，是的；我只要带雷米去那儿就行了；我永远不应该听到最后一个！

These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it, he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: ‘There was a time when Odette loved me more,’ but he never formed any definite picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said: ‘Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back,’ and ‘At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,’ so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days.
奥黛特现在对斯旺采取的这些新的态度，冷漠、无精打采、易怒，无疑让他很痛苦。但他并没有意识到自己遭受了多少痛苦；因为奥黛特对他的冷淡是有规律的，日复一日，只有通过直接对比她现在的样子和最初的样子，他才能衡量出变化的程度。已经发生了。现在这种变化是他深深的、隐秘的伤口，让他日夜痛苦，每当他觉得自己的思绪离它太近时，他就会迅速将其转移到另一个通道，生怕让自己承受太深的痛苦。他可能会含糊地对自己说：“曾经有一段时间，奥黛特更爱我。”但他从未对那段时间形成任何明确的印象。正如他在书房里有一个柜子，每次他进出房间时，他都会把柜子转到一边以免经过，因为他把她送给他的菊花锁在柜子的一个抽屉里。当他用马车带她回家时的第一个晚上，以及她在信中说：“你为什么不忘记你的心？”我不应该让你把它拿回来”，“无论白天还是晚上，无论你需要我，只要给我发个消息，然后按照你的意愿处置我”，所以他心里有一个地方可以他决不允许他的思想侵入它太近，如果需要的话，迫使它们通过长时间的推理来逃避它，这样他们就不必经过它的范围。那个让他回忆起幸福时光的地方。

But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party.
但有一天晚上，当他出去参加一个聚会时，他如此细致的谨慎被打破了。

It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte’s, on the last, for that season, of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the Marquise’s, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:
那是在圣埃维尔特侯爵夫人家，那个演出季的最后一个晚上，她邀请人们聆听音乐家的演奏，这些音乐家后来为她的慈善音乐会服务。斯万本来打算依次去前几个晚上，但始终无法下定决心，当他为这次聚会穿衣服时，德·夏吕斯男爵来访，他提出了一个邀请和他一起去侯爵夫人家，如果他的陪伴能帮助斯万在到达那里时不那么无聊，不那么不高兴的话。但斯旺对他表示感谢：

‘You can’t conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don’t suppose she’ll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I’m sure she would be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you’ll find her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if there’s anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three take; anything you can think of. I don’t count upon seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole, you’ve only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me—you know what I feel about you!’
“你无法想象我会对你的陪伴感到多么高兴。但如果你愿意去见奥黛特，我就能得到最大的快乐。你知道你对她的影响有多大。我想她今晚不会去任何地方，除非她去看她的老裁缝，而且我相信如果你和她一起去那里，她会很高兴。无论如何，在那之前你会在家里找到她的。尽量让她开心，并给她一些合理的建议。如果你明天能安排一些让她高兴的事情，我们三个人可以一起做的事情。也尝试对夏天进行试探。看看她是否想做点什么，比如我们三个都可以乘坐的游船；任何你能想到的。我本人今晚并不指望能见到她。不过，如果她想让我来，或者你发现了漏洞，你只需要给我发一条电话给我。 de Saint-Euverte 一直工作到午夜；之后我就在这里。非常感谢你为我所做的一切——你知道我对你的感觉！

His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac’s ‘tigers’—now ‘grooms’—. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him.
他的朋友答应，一把他送到圣尤韦尔特家门口，他就答应按照斯万的意愿去做。到达那里，他想到德·夏吕斯先生将在拉佩鲁兹街过夜，心里感到宽慰。但他们对与奥黛特无关的一切，尤其是时尚生活的细节，都表现出一种忧郁的冷漠态度，这种状态赋予了他们一种魅力，这种魅力可以在任何不再是我们欲望的对象中找到。 ，以它自己的面目出现在我们面前。下了马车，在女主人在仪式场合很乐意向客人提供的对她们家庭生活的虚构总结的前景中，她们在其中表现出对服装和布景的准确性的极大重视，斯旺有趣地发现巴尔扎克的“老虎”——现在的“新郎”——的继承人和继任者。通常，当女主人出国时，他们会跟着她，但现在，他们戴着帽子，穿着靴子，被派到门外，在房子前面的碎石路上，或者在马厩外面，因为园丁可能会在街道尽头被抽出来接受检查。他们的几个花坛。他一直必须在活人与画廊肖像之间寻找类比的特殊倾向在这里再次体现出来，但以一种更积极、更普遍的形式；现在他已经脱离了整个社会，它以一系列的图片呈现在他面前。 在衣帽间里，在过去，当他还是一个时尚人士时，他会穿着大衣进去，然后穿着晚礼服出来，但对那里发生的事情没有任何印象，他的他现在第一次注意到，在他度过的那一两分钟里，他的心思要么还在他刚刚离开的聚会上，要么已经在他即将被带入的聚会上了。被如此迟到的客人的意外到来惊醒了，分散的一群华丽而轻松的动物，巨大的仆人在长凳和箱子上打瞌睡，直到他们指着他们高贵的灵缇犬的轮廓，站起来聚集在一起围着他转了一圈。

One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions, tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his ‘things.’ But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity.
其中一个，面容特别凶猛，与某些文艺复兴时期绘画中的刽子手没有什么不同，这些画代表了处决、酷刑等，以一种无情的神态向他走来，要拿走他的“东西”。他的棉手套柔软得恰到好处，以至于当他走近斯万时，他似乎立刻表现出对自己本人的彻底蔑视和对他帽子的最温柔的尊重。他小心翼翼地接住了它，他的动作精确得几乎有些过分挑剔，而他的微妙则因他强大的力量而显得几乎令人感动。然后他把它传给了他的一个卫星，一个新手和胆怯的人，他愤怒地向各个方向投来目光，表达了压倒他的恐慌，并表现出了野生动物在被囚禁的最初几个小时内所有的愚蠢的激动。

A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna’s paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race—if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams—fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master’s Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer’s Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Man-tuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator’s purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man’s simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent’s writhing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the ‘Staircase of the Giants,’ and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker’s, in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to the old dressmaker’s, since there was no other, no service stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter’s lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate), scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya’s sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall which—just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides—displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Ben-venuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith—an allegory of alarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot—to be looking out, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart.
几英尺外，一个穿着制服的魁梧大伙子站着沉思，一动不动，雕像般，毫无用处，就像曼特尼亚最混乱的画作中那个纯粹装饰性的战士一样，迷失在梦中，靠在他的盾牌上，而他周围都是战斗、流血和死亡；他脱离了围在斯旺身边的同伴，似乎决心对这一场景保持漠不关心，他用他残忍的绿眼睛模糊地注视着这一幕，仿佛这是无辜者的大屠杀或圣人的殉难。詹姆士。他似乎正是从那个消失的种族中诞生的——如果它确实曾经存在过的话，除了在圣芝诺的重画和埃雷米塔尼的壁画中，斯旺在那里与它接触过，而且它仍然梦想着——它的果实。大师的帕多瓦模型或阿尔伯特·杜勒尔的撒克逊人模型对古典雕像的浸渍。他那一绺微红的头发本来就皱巴巴的，但用光亮剂粘在头上，他的处理方式与希腊雕塑中的情况一样，满团画家从未停止过研究，如果按照其创作者的目的，它代表的只是人，至少设法从人的简单轮廓中提取出如此丰富的多样性，可以说是从整个生气勃勃的自然中借来的，一头头发，通过其卷曲的光泽波动和喙状点，或者在其拉绒头发的华丽三层王冠的覆盖下，可以立刻让人联想到一束海藻、一群雏鸽、一床风信子和一条扭动的蛇背。 还有一些同样巨大的楼梯被安置在一座巨大楼梯的台阶上，由于它们的装饰性存在和马尔莫雷式的不动性，使得它值得被命名，就像总督宫里那座神加冕的楼梯一样，“楼梯”巨人队”，斯万现在踏上了这条路，他为奥黛特从未登上过它而感到悲伤。啊，另一方面，他会多么高兴地沿着黑暗、恶臭、危险的航班飞向小裁缝店，在她的阁楼上，他很乐意支付歌剧院每周一次的舞台包厢的费用当奥黛特来的时候，她有权在那里度过一个晚上，其他日子也是如此，因为有权利谈论她，生活在他不在时她经常见到的人中间，因此，他们，他们之间似乎保守着他情妇生活中某些比他所知道的更真实、更难以接近、更神秘的秘密。 然而，在通往老裁缝店的那个令人羡慕的、令人羡慕的楼梯上，因为大楼里没有其他的、没有服务楼梯，人们在晚上看到每扇门外都有一个空的、未洗的牛奶罐，准备早上的巡查，在门垫上；在那一刻，斯旺正在攀爬那座卑鄙的巨大楼梯，楼梯在他的两侧，在不同的高度，在门房小屋的窗户或一组房间的入口处的墙壁上的每一个弯曲之前，代表部门他们负责室内服务，并向客人表示敬意，包括一名看门人、一名管家、一名管家（这些值得尊敬的人，他们在自己的领地里度过了半独立的一周，他们在那里用餐他们自己就像小店主一样，明天可能就会沦为某个成功的医生或工业巨头的平民服务），在被允许穿上华丽的制服之前，他们会一丝不苟地执行所有强加给他们的指示。他们只是每隔很长一段时间才穿衣服，在这种情况下，他们并没有感到完全放松，他们各自站在门口的拱廊上，他们辉煌的盛况被民主的良好友谊所调和，就像圣人在他们的壁龛里，还有一个巨大的引座员，穿着瑞士卫队时装，就像教堂里的执事一样，当每个新来的人经过他身边时，他都会用他的手杖敲击人行道。斯万来到楼梯顶上，身后跟着一个面色苍白、脑后扎着一根小辫子的仆人，就像戈雅的圣器管理员或老戏剧中的一个小帐篷一样。在办公室里，仆人们像公证人一样坐在巨大的登记册前，庄严地站起来，写下了他的名字。 接下来，他穿过一个小大厅，里面——就像某些房间被它们的主人安排来作为一件艺术品的背景一样（它们的名字就来源于此），而且，在它们经过精心设计的空旷中，除此之外什么也没有——展示当他走进去的时候，他看到了这样的景象，就像本-韦努托·切利尼（Ben-venuto Cellini）创作的无价的武装守望者雕像，一个年轻的男仆，他的身体微微前倾，在深红色的护颈上方竖起一张更加深红色的脸，从这张脸中似乎涌出了一股洪流。火焰、胆怯和热情，当他用急躁、警惕、绝望的眼神刺穿房间门上的奥比松挂毯时，他出现了，带着军人般的冷漠或超自然的信仰——一个寓言警报的化身，警觉的化身，暴乱的纪念——天使或哨兵，从地牢或大教堂的塔楼向外张望，等待敌人的逼近或审判的时刻。斯万现在只需进入音乐厅，门就被一个带着锁链的引座员打开了，引座员在他面前低下头，仿佛把一座被征服城市的钥匙交给了他。但他想到了那一刻，如果奥黛特允许的话，他可能就在这座房子里，而他记得瞥见门垫上有一个空牛奶罐，这让他心痛不已。

He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,—instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged—were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréaute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General’s monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Bréaute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments.
当挂毯窗帘的另一边，仆人的景象取代了客人的景象时，他很快就恢复了对人类男性普遍丑陋的感觉。但即使是这些丑陋的面孔，当然对他来说是最熟悉的，也显得有些新奇和不可思议，因为他们的特征，对他来说不再是识别这个或那个人的实际用途的象征，而在此之前，他们已经它们仅仅代表了许多需要追求的快乐，需要避免的无聊，或者需要得到承认的礼貌——它们是静止的，可以仅通过美学坐标来测量，在它们的曲线和角度的自主性中。而在这些人身上，斯万现在发现自己挤满了人，没有任何东西（甚至他们中的许多人都戴着单片眼镜，以前最多只能让斯万说这样的话—— ——所以戴着单片眼镜），这种习惯不再局限于习惯的一般含义，所有这些习惯都是一样的，现在并没有给他带来每一种习惯的个性感。也许是因为他并不认为德·弗罗贝维尔将军和德·布雷奥特侯爵在门内交谈，只不过是一幅画中的两个人物，而他们是把他推选为骑师的老朋友，有用的人。俱乐部并在决斗中为他提供支持，将军的单片眼镜像炮弹碎片一样粘在他那张普通的、伤痕累累、胜利而专横的脸上，在前额的中间，它使他半盲，就像单眼闪烁的前额一样。独眼巨人，在斯旺看来是一个巨大的伤口，接受它可能是光荣的，但暴露它肯定不体面，而M. 德·布雷奥特（de Bréaute）外出时戴着珍珠灰色手套、碎花帽和白色领带，作为节日徽章，用它代替了熟悉的眼镜（就像斯旺本人那样），无聊，粘在另一只眼镜上。侧面，就像在显微镜载玻片上准备的标本一样，一种无限微小的目光，充满了友好的感觉，并且在高耸的天花板、愉快的聚会、有趣的节目和卓越的茶点上不断闪烁。

‘Hallo! you here! why, it’s ages since I’ve seen you,’ the General greeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, ‘You’re looking well, old man!’ while M. de Bréauté turned with, ‘My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?’ to a ‘society novelist’ who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the ‘r’:—‘I am observing!’
‘哈喽！你在这里！哎呀，我已经好久没见到你了，”将军向斯万打招呼，注意到他脸上紧张的表情，得出结论，这可能是一场严重的疾病让他离开了，然后继续说，“你看起来很好，老伙计！”德·布雷奥特先生转身对一位刚刚把自己的单片眼镜戴在眉毛和脸颊上的“社会小说家”问道，“我亲爱的朋友，你到底在这里做什么？”他在心理调查和对性格进行无情分析时使用了这个工具，现在他带着神秘而重要的神情回答道，滚动着“r”：“我正在观察！”

The Marquis de Forestelle’s monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp’s head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto’s Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair.
福雷斯泰尔侯爵的单片眼镜又小又无框，通过强迫眼睛不断地痛苦地收缩，眼睛上的单片眼镜像多余的软骨一样结痂，其存在令人费解，其实质难以想象，这使他的脸忧郁的优雅，让女人们认为他在恋爱时会遭受极大的痛苦。但德·圣康德先生的脸像土星一样，戴着一个巨大的环，是一张脸的重心，每时每刻都在与玻璃相关的时候重新镇定下来，而他的红鼻子和肿胀的讽刺嘴唇则努力地努力着。通过她们的鬼脸，上升到抛光圆盘上闪烁的稳定智慧火焰的水平，并看到自己比世界上最迷人的眼睛更喜欢聪明，堕落的年轻女性，她们梦想着人造的魅力和精致。感官的幸福；然后，在他身后的是德·帕兰西先生，他有着巨大的鲤鱼头和瞪大的眼睛，在节日聚会的人流中缓慢地上下移动，每时每刻都张开他的大下颌，仿佛在寻找自己的方位，他的神态是：他随身携带的只是他的水族馆玻璃墙的一个偶然的、或许纯粹是象征性的碎片，这一部分的目的是暗示整体，这让斯万想起了帕多瓦乔托《恶习与美德》的狂热崇拜者，他身边的不公正现象枝繁叶茂的树枝让人想起笼罩着他秘密巢穴的森林。

Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of ‘uncertain’ age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte inter, mezzo (Liszt’s ‘Saint Francis preaching to the birds’) which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: ‘It isn’t possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!’; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head—transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely ‘I can’t help it’) so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Fran-quetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory no unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible characterer like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter’s marriage. The thought filled her with anger—and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes’s, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there—a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, ‘After all, it isn’t for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is.’ And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the ‘stuck-on’ head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of ‘bearing’ which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon’s conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as ‘at my cousins the Guermantes’s,’ ‘at my aunt Guermantes’s,’ ‘Elzéar de Guermantes’s health,’ ‘my cousin Guermantes’s box.’ If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes’s, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us ‘extend’ so as to develop the expansion of our chests.
斯万在夫人的压力下走进了房间。 de Saint-Euverte，为了聆听长笛演奏的奥菲欧咏叹调，他在一个角落里占据了一个位置，不幸的是，他的视野被两位年龄“不确定”的女士所限制，坐着康布勒梅侯爵夫人和弗朗克托子爵夫人肩并肩，因为她们是表兄弟，她们常常在聚会上在房间里闲逛，每个人都抓着自己的包，后面跟着她的女儿，像人一样互相寻找对方。在火车站，他们永远不能休息，除非他们用扇子或手帕在座位上做标记，预订了两把相邻的椅子；女士。德·康布尔梅夫人，因为她几乎不认识任何人，所以更高兴有一个同伴，而夫人。相反，德·弗朗克托非常受欢迎，她认为向她所有的好朋友表明，她更喜欢与一个默默无闻的乡村表弟在一起，她与她有共同的童年记忆，这是有效和新颖的。斯万满怀讽刺的忧郁，看着他们听着长笛之后传来的钢琴间中音（李斯特的《圣弗朗西斯向鸟儿布道》），并跟随这位演奏家令人晕眩的飞行；女士。德·弗兰奎托焦急地看着她，她的眼睛从她的头开始，仿佛他的手指如此敏捷地跳过的琴键是一系列的秋千，他可能从其中任何一个坠落到一百英尺高的地面上，现在偷窃并偷走。然后她用惊讶和难以置信的眼神看着她的同伴，就像谁应该说：“这不可能，我永远不会相信一个人可以做到这一切！”女士。 德·康布勒梅，作为一个受过良好音乐教育的女人，用她的头打拍子——暂时变成了节拍器的钟摆，其从一个肩膀到另一个肩膀的动作迅速而迅速（以那种看起来患者眼中流露出的狂野遗弃，不再能够分析自己的痛苦，也不再急于控制它，而只是说“我无能为力”）如此强烈，以至于她的钻石耳环每时每刻都会陷入修剪之中她不得不把头发上的那串黑葡萄拉直，尽管她不断加速的动作没有受到任何干扰。在夫人的另一边（前面不远）。德·弗朗凯托，是加拉东侯爵夫人，全神贯注于她最喜欢的沉思，即她自己与盖尔芒特家族的血缘关系，她从公开和私下中获得了大量的荣耀，其中不乏耻辱，最辉煌的装饰品那所房子对她有些疏远，也许因为她只是一个令人厌烦的老太婆，或者因为她是一个可耻的老太婆，或者因为她出身于家庭的下层分支，或者很可能根本没有任何原因。当她发现自己坐在一个她不认识的人旁边时，就像此时她坐在夫人旁边一样。 de Franquetot，她深感痛苦，因为她自己对与盖尔芒特的联系的意识无法以可见的特征从外部表现出来，就像在拜占庭教堂的马赛克中，将一个放在另一个下面，刻在旁边的垂直柱子上的那些某些神圣人物应该说的话。 此刻她在想，自从她的表弟洛姆公主结婚六年以来，她从未收到过她的邀请，甚至没有接到过她的电话。这个想法让她充满了愤怒——同时也充满了自豪。因为，通过告诉所有对从未在夫人那里见到她而表示惊讶的人。德·洛姆斯的说法是，这是因为在那里遇到了玛蒂尔德公主的风险——她自己的家人，最真实、最忧郁的正统主义者，永远不会原谅她，她逐渐相信这实际上是她的原因。她没有去看望她的小表弟。她记得，确实，她曾多次询问过夫人。德斯·洛姆斯想知道他们会如何见面，但她只是以一种混乱的方式记得这件事，此外，她不仅通过低声咕哝着来中和这种有点羞辱的回忆，“毕竟，迈出第一步的不是我；而是我。”我至少比她大二十岁。”这些未说出口的话让她更加坚强，她骄傲地把肩膀向后一甩，直到它们似乎与她的半身像分开，而她的头几乎水平地靠在它们身上，让人想起“粘”上的野鸡头被带到餐桌上，上面装饰着它的羽毛，富丽堂皇。她一点也不像野鸡，生来就具有矮胖、阳刚的身材；但连续的屈辱使她向后倾斜，就像人们可以在悬崖边上扎根的树木中观察到的那样，它们被迫向后生长以保持平衡。 由于她为了安慰自己与盖尔芒特家族的其他人不太一样，不得不不断地对自己重复说，正是由于她的原则和骄傲的不妥协的僵化，她才很少见到他们，不断的迭代逐渐改变了她的身体，赋予了她一种被平民视为教养标志的“举止”，甚至有时在俱乐部里老绅士疲惫的眼睛里点燃了瞬间的火花。 。有没有人对女士进行过迫害？德加拉东的谈话与这种分析形式的对话，通过注意到其中几个术语的相对频率，将为他提供密码信息的钥匙，他会立即指出其中没有任何表达，甚至是最常见的言语形式。几乎经常是“在我表弟盖尔芒特家”、“在我姨妈盖尔芒特家”、“埃尔泽尔·德·盖尔芒特的健康状况”、“我表弟盖尔芒特的包厢”。如果有人向她谈到一位杰出人物，她会回答说，尽管她她本人并不认识他，她在盖尔芒特姨妈家里见过他数百次，但她会用如此冰冷的语气、如此空洞的声音说出这个回答，以至于人们立刻就很清楚，如果她不知道就名人个人而言，这是因为所有顽固的、根深蒂固的原则，她的拱形肩膀向后伸展休息，就像体操教练让我们在梯子上“伸展”以发展胸部的扩张一样。

At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s that evening, did in fact arrive. To shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision—so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due—to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might, so to speak, ‘count double’) to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she called ‘exaggerating,’ and always made a point of letting people see that she ‘simply must not’ indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist’s. When he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately—with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish—to clutch at one’s heart.
此刻，洛梅斯公主原本没有预料到会出现在夫人身边。那天晚上，de Saint-Euverte 确实到了。为了表明她不希望在她居高临下的房子里受到任何特别的关注，她的上级地位得到了特别的关注，她进入房间时双臂紧贴在身体两侧，即使在房间里没有人可以挤过去，也没有人试图从她身边挤过去。故意站在后面，一副在适当位置的样子，就像一位国王站在剧院门口等待的队伍中，但管理层没有收到他的到来警告；并严格限制她的视野——以免显得在宣传她的存在并声称她应得的考虑——研究地毯上或她自己裙子上的图案，她站在那儿在她看来，她是最谦虚的（她很清楚，一旦注意到她的存在，德·圣德·埃维尔特夫人就会发出一声狂喜的叫声，让她解脱出来）。德·康布勒梅，然而，她并不认识他。她观察了邻居表达她对音乐的热情的哑剧，但她没有模仿。这并不是说，她第一次同意在夫人身上呆几分钟。在 de Saint-Euverte 的家中，洛姆斯公主不会希望（因此她前来对女主人表现出的礼貌行为可以说是“加倍”）表现出尽可能的友好和乐于助人。 但她对她所谓的“夸张”有一种天生的恐惧，并且总是刻意让人们看到她“绝对不能”沉迷于任何与她所在圈子的基调不相符的情感表现。尽管这样的表现总是给她留下深刻的印象，但由于那种模仿精神，类似于胆怯，这种精神在最自信的人中通过接触陌生的环境而产生，即使它不如自己的环境，但她还是很感动。他们自己的。她开始问自己，这些手势是否可能不是正在播放的音乐的必要伴奏，这首音乐可能与她以前听过的所有音乐属于不同的类别;是否不参加这些音乐并不表示她自己无法理解音乐，也不表示她对女主人不礼貌。结果，为了通过妥协依次表达她两种矛盾的倾向，她有时只会拉直肩带，或者在金色的头发中摸索珊瑚或粉红色珐琅的小球，上面磨砂小钻石，形成了它简单而有效的装饰，带着冷漠的兴趣，研究着她热情的邻居，而在另一个时候，她会用扇子打几条酒吧的时间，但是，为了不丧失她的独立性，她会打败与钢琴家的时间不同。当他完成了李斯特间奏曲并开始了肖邦的前奏曲时，夫人。德·康布勒梅转向夫人。 de Franquetot 脸上带着温柔的微笑，充满了亲密的回忆，以及对表演的满意（一个称职的法官的满意）。 她在少女时代就被教导要爱抚和珍惜那些长脖子、蜿蜒的生物，肖邦的乐句，如此自由，如此灵活，如此有触觉，它们首先在远离方向的地方寻找它们的最终安息之地他们开始的地方，人们可能期望他们达到的点，这些短语在那些奇妙的旁路中转移自己，只是为了更故意地返回——带着更有预谋的反应，更精确，就像在一个水晶碗上，如果你敲击它，它会响起并跳动，直到你痛苦地大声哭泣——抓住一个人的心。

Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of ‘really musical’ people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having ‘got as far’ as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead. But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured ‘How charming it is!’ with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot’s head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not ‘of her generation,’ she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to ‘force’ a card, began with: ‘How is your husband?’ in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: ‘Why; he’s never been better in his life!’ And she went on laughing.
她在一个没有朋友或访客的外省家庭长大，几乎没有被邀请参加舞会，她在她那座古老庄园的孤独中胡思乱想，过度设定节奏，时而缓慢爬行，时而充满激情，旋转，气喘吁吁，为那些想象中的华尔兹情侣，像鲜花一样聚集在一起，离开舞厅片刻聆听，风在松树间叹息，在湖岸上，看到突然向她走来一个身材修长的年轻人，戴着白手套，声音洪亮、陌生又虚假，与世间恋人的梦想更加不同。但如今，这种音乐的老式美感似乎变得有些陈旧了。几年前，它失去了“真正的音乐人”的尊重，失去了它的独特性和魅力，甚至那些品味很差的人也不再在其中找到更多的乐趣，而他们几乎不喜欢这种乐趣。承认。女士。德·康布勒梅偷偷地看了她一眼。她知道她年轻的儿媳妇（对她的新贵族家庭充满敬意，除了与智力有关的事情之外，在智力方面，她已经“深入”到了和谐和希腊字母，她特别开明）鄙视肖邦，当她听到他演奏时病得很重。但她发现自己摆脱了这位瓦格纳主义者的审视，她坐在一群与她同时代的人中，距离很远。德·康布雷默让自己沉浸在精致的记忆和感觉的溪流中。洛姆斯公主也被感动了。 虽然她没有任何音乐方面的天赋，但大约十五年前，她接受了圣日耳曼郊区一位音乐女教师的指导，她是一位天才的女人，在她生命的最后一刻，却陷入了贫困，七十岁时，她开始把钱捐给她老学生的女儿和孙女。这位女士现在已经死了。但她的方法，她迷人的触感的回声，时不时地在她的学生的手指中变得生动起来，即使是那些在其他方面相当平庸、放弃了音乐、几乎从未打开过钢琴的学生。女士也是如此。德斯·洛梅斯可以让她的头来回摇摆，完全意识到原因，并且完美地欣赏钢琴家演奏这首前奏曲的方式，因为她已经熟记于心了。他开始说的那句话的结束语已经在她的唇边响起。她低声说道，“多么迷人啊！”，重音放在形容词的开头辅音上，这是她优雅的象征，她感觉自己的嘴唇如此浪漫地压缩，就像一朵美丽的含苞待放的花朵的花瓣，她本能地带来了她的眼睛变得和谐，用一种模糊而感伤的目光照亮了它们。与此同时，夫人。德加拉东已经到了对自己说，她见到洛姆公主的机会如此之少，这是多么令人恼火，因为她想通过不向她鞠躬来给她一个教训。她不知道她的表弟在房间里。女士的运动。弗兰奎托的头显露了公主的面目。立刻夫人。 德加拉东冲向她，惹恼了她所有的邻居。尽管决心保持一种疏远和冰冷的态度，这应该提醒在场的每个人，她不想与一个人保持友好关系，在这个人的房子里，人们可能会发现自己在任何一天都与玛蒂尔德公主亲密接触，并且对她来说由于她不是“她这一代人”，所以她没有义务去主动取悦，她觉得有必要通过一些不置可否的言论来改变这种尊严和矜持的态度，这将证明她的提议是合理的，并会迫使公主进行对话；因此，当她到达她的表弟夫人那里时。德·加拉登表情严肃，伸出一只手，仿佛在试图“强行”一张牌，她开始问道：“你丈夫怎么样？”如果王子认真的话，她也会用同样焦急的语气。患病的。公主突然大笑起来，这是她的特色之一，她的目的是立即向集会的其他人表明她正在取笑某人，同时也通过将她的特征集中在她生动的嘴唇和周围来增强她自己的美丽。眼睛闪闪发亮，回答道：“为什么？”他这辈子从来没有这么好过！”她继续笑。

Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince’s health, said to her cousin:
女士。德加拉东然后挺直了身子，也许是因为她仍然对王子的健康状况感到不安，她的表情更加冰冷，对她的表弟说：

‘Oriane,’ (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) ‘I should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your opinion of it.’
“奥丽安娜，”（德·洛梅斯夫人立即带着有趣的惊讶看着看不见的第三者，她似乎要叫他来见证她从未授权德·加拉东夫人使用她的教名）“如果你明天晚上，我会进去听一分钟，听莫扎特的单簧管五重奏。我想听听你对此的看法。

She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour, and to want the Princess’s opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge.
与其说她是在发出邀请，不如说是在请求帮助，她想听听公主对莫扎特五重奏的看法，尽管这道菜是一位新厨师发明的，而他的才华最重要的是一位美食家的到来。判断。

‘But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now—that I adore it.’
“但我很了解那个五重奏。我现在可以告诉你——我喜欢它。

‘You know, my husband isn’t at all well; it’s his liver. He would like so much to see you,’ Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work of charity for the Princess to appear at her party.
‘你知道，我丈夫身体不太好；这是他的肝脏。他非常想见到你，”夫人。德加拉东的活动又恢复了，这使得公主出席她的派对成为了一项慈善事业。

The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away—by the sudden arrival of her husband’s mother, by an invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country—from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty ‘Guermantes set’—in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from Mérimée, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and Halévy—she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come.
公主从来不喜欢告诉人们她不会去他们家。她每天都会写信来表达她的遗憾，因为她丈夫的母亲突然到来，他哥哥的邀请，歌剧院，去乡下旅行，她从未参加过某个聚会。一时梦想着要去。通过这种方式，她让许多人感到满足，觉得她与他们关系亲密，她很乐意来到他们的家里，只是因为发生了一些王子事件而阻止了她这样做，而他们很高兴地发现，与自己卑微的娱乐活动竞争。然后，由于她属于那种机智的“盖尔芒特派”——其中保留着一些警觉的心态，剥夺了所有常见的短语和传统的情感，这些可以追溯到梅里美，并在梅亚克和哈莱维的戏剧中找到了它的最终表达——她调整了它的公式，以适应她的社交活动，将其转化为礼貌，这种礼貌总是努力变得积极和精确，以接近简单的事实。她永远不会向女主人表达她对参加聚会的焦虑。她发现向她透露所有各种小事件会更愉快，而这些小事件将取决于她是否可以来。

‘Listen, and I’ll explain,’ she began to Mme. de Gallardon. ‘To-morrow evening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can’t possibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the house, I know there won’t be anyone else there, so I can slip away.’
“听着，我会解释的，”她对夫人说道。德·加拉东. “明天晚上我必须去找我的一个朋友，他多年来一直缠着我安排一天。如果她之后带我们去剧院，那么我就不可能来找你了，尽管我很想来；但如果我们只是呆在房子里，我知道那里不会有其他人，所以我可以溜走。

‘Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?’
“告诉我，你见过你的朋友斯旺先生吗？”

‘No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must catch his eye.’
'不！我亲爱的查尔斯！我从来不知道他在这里。他在哪里？我必须引起他的注意。

‘It’s a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte’s,’ Mme. de Gallardon went on. ‘Oh, I know he’s very clever,’ meaning by that ‘very cunning,’ ‘but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the sister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.’
“他竟然来到老圣埃弗特家，这真是一件有趣的事，”夫人说。德加拉东继续说道。 “哦，我知道他很聪明”，意思是“非常狡猾”，“但这没有什么区别；”我喜欢这里的一个犹太人，她是两位大主教的妹妹和嫂子。”

‘I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,’ said the Princesse des Laumes.
“我很惭愧地承认，我一点也不感到震惊，”洛姆斯王妃说道。

‘I know he’s a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones, that it’s all just a pretence; is that true, d’you think?’
“我知道他是一名皈依犹太教的犹太人，还有他的父母和祖父母。但他们确实说，皈依的人比信奉宗教的人更糟糕，这只是一个借口；你认为这是真的吗？

‘I can throw no light at all on the matter.’
“我对这件事根本无法给出任何解释。”

The pianist, who was ‘down’ to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes’s paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin’s music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile.
这位钢琴家正“沮丧”地演奏了肖邦的两首曲子，在完成前奏曲后，他立即开始攻击一首波兰舞曲。但有一次女士。德加拉东告诉她的表弟，斯旺在房间里，肖邦本人可能会从坟墓里复活，在没有德加拉东夫人的情况下依次演奏他的所有作品。德斯·洛姆斯对他丝毫不感兴趣。她属于人类的两个分支之一，其中另一半对它不认识的人的不懈好奇被对它所认识的人的持久兴趣所取代。与圣日耳曼郊区的许多女性一样，在她可能发现自己所在的任何房间里，即使她没有什么特别要对他说的事情，她的另一位成员的存在也会占据她的注意力，将其排除在外。所有其他考虑因素。从那一刻起，公主希望斯旺能够看到她，她什么也做不了，只能把脸转过来（就像一只驯服的小白鼠，把一块糖放在它的鼻子前，然后又拿走）。斯旺所在的方向挤满了一千种亲密默许的迹象，但没有一个与肖邦音乐背后的情感毫无关系，而且，如果他移动，相应地转移她磁性微笑的方向。

‘Oriane, don’t be angry with me,’ resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable, ‘people do say about your M. Swann that he’s the sort of man one can’t have in the house; is that true?’
“奥丽安娜，别生我的气，”夫人继续说道。德加拉东永远无法克制自己牺牲自己最高的社会抱负，并希望有一天她能成为一种让世界眼花缭乱的光芒，说出一些令人不快的事情来立即获得秘密的满足感，“人们确实会谈论你的”斯旺先生说他是那种不能出现在家里​​的人；真的吗？'

‘Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it’s true,’ replied the Princesse des Laumes, ‘for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he’s never been to your house once.’
“为什么，在所有人中，你应该知道这是真的，”洛姆斯公主回答道，“因为你一定问过他一百次了，而他却从来没有去过你家一次。”

And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after her father-in-law, who was ill.
令她的表弟再次感到羞愧的是，她又爆发出一阵大笑，这让每个想听音乐的人都感到震惊，但却引起了夫人的注意。出于礼貌，德·圣厄韦尔特一直待在钢琴旁边，现在他第一次看到了公主。女士。 de Saint-Euverte 见到夫人更加高兴。德洛姆，她想象自己仍在盖尔芒特，照顾生病的公公。

‘My dear Princess, you here?’
“我亲爱的公主，你在吗？”

‘Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I’ve been hearing such lovely things.’
“是的，我把自己藏在一个角落里，我一直听到很多可爱的事情。”

‘What, you’ve been in the room quite a time?’
“什么，你已经在房间里待了很长时间了？”

‘Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long because I couldn’t see you.’
‘哦，是的，相当长的一段时间，却又显得很短；只是因为我看不到你所以时间才长而已。

Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined it with:
女士。 de Saint-Euverte 向公主提供了自己的椅子，但公主拒绝了：

‘Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn’t matter in the least where I sit.’ And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: ‘There now, that hassock, that’s all I want. It will make me keep my back straight. Oh! Good heavens, I’m making a noise again; they’ll be telling you to have me ‘chucked out’.’
‘哦，拜托，不！你为什么要？坐在哪里一点都不重要。”并且故意挑选，为了更好地展现一位真正伟大女士的朴素，一个没有靠背的矮座：“现在，那个垫子，这就是我想要的。它会让我保持背部挺直。哦！天哪，我又发出噪音了；他们会告诉你把我‘赶出去’。”

Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other ‘party-night’, Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess’s eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other’s having ‘thought of her’ in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist’s fate but the piano’s, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole.
与此同时，钢琴家的速度加倍，音乐爱好者的情绪达到了高潮，一个仆人正在托盘上分发茶点，并把勺子弄得嘎嘎作响，而且，就像每一个“派对之夜”一样，女士。德·圣埃维尔特正在向他打手势，让他离开房间，但他没有看到。一位新婚的新娘被告知年轻女子永远不应该显得无聊，她脸上笑容灿烂，试图吸引女主人的目光，以表达她对对方“考虑到她”的感激之情。令人愉快的一种娱乐。然而，尽管她仍然比夫人更冷静。德·弗兰奎托，随着飞舞的手指，她不免有些不安。令她惊慌的不是钢琴家的命运，而是钢琴的命运，钢琴上有一根点燃的蜡烛，在每个最强音处跳动，即使不会点燃它的灯罩，至少也会把蜡洒在乌木上。最后她再也按捺不住了，跑上钢琴平台的两级台阶，扑到蜡烛上调整烛台。但当她的手刚伸到最后一个和弦时，这首曲子就完成了，钢琴家站了起来。尽管如此，这位年轻女子所表现出的大胆举措，以及由此导致的她和钢琴家之间尴尬的脸红的时刻，总体上给人留下了良好的印象。

‘Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?’ asked General de Froberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her for a moment. ‘Odd, wasn’t it? Is she one of the performers?’
“公主，你看到那个女孩刚才做了什么吗？”走到夫人身边的德·弗罗伯维尔将军问道。女主人德·洛姆斯暂时离开了她。 ‘奇怪，不是吗？她是表演者之一吗？

‘No, she’s a little Mme. de Cambremer,’ replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: ‘I am only repeating what I heard just now, myself; I haven’t the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the country, but I don’t believe anyone knows them, really. They must be ‘country cousins’! By the way, I don’t know whether you’re particularly ‘well-up’ in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I’ve no idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do with themselves when they’re not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s parties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food. ‘Universal providers,’ you know. You must admit, they’re rather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire the same ‘supers’ every week? It isn’t possible!’
“不，她是个小夫人。”德·康布勒梅，”公主漫不经心地回答道，然后，她更加兴奋了：“我只是重复一下我刚才听到的，我自己；我完全不知道是谁说的，是我身后的某个人说他们是夫人的邻居。 de Saint-Euverte 在这个国家，但我不相信有人认识他们，真的。他们一定是‘乡下表兄弟’！顺便说一句，我不知道你是否在我们所看到的辉煌社会中感到特别“富裕”，因为我不知道这些令人惊叹的人是谁。你认为他们不在夫人身边时会做什么呢？ de Saint-Euverte 的派对？她一定是把他们和音乐家、椅子和食物一起点了进来。 “通用提供商”，你知道的。您必须承认，他们相当出色，将军。但她真的有勇气每周雇佣同样的“超级员工”吗？这是不可能的！

‘Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,’ protested the General.
“哦，不过康布勒默是一个很好的名字；将军也抗议道。

‘I see no objection to its being old,’ the Princess answered dryly, ‘but whatever else it is it’s not euphonious,’ she went on, isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to which the Guermantes set were addicted.
“我不认为它是旧的，”公主干巴巴地回答道，“但无论它是什么，它都不悦耳，”她继续说道，将“悦耳”这个词隔离在引号之间，盖尔芒特家族的设定有点矫揉造作。上瘾。

‘You think not, eh! She’s a regular little peach, though,’ said the General, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. ‘Don’t you agree with me, Princess?’
‘你以为不会，嗯！不过，她是个普通的小桃子。”将军说道，他的目光从未离开过夫人。德康布雷默。 “你不同意我的看法吗，公主？”

‘She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman, that’s not very nice—for I don’t suppose she’s my generation,’ replied Mme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half wishing to oblige the General: ‘Not very nice... for her husband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I might have introduced you to her,’ said the Princess, who, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort. ‘And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,’ she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her appearance. ‘Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I’ve been here, he’s gone to see those friends of his—you know them too, I’m sure,—who are called after a bridge—oh, yes, the Iénas.’
“她太过于向前推进；我认为，对于如此年轻的女性来说，这不太好——因为我不认为她是我这一代人，”夫人回答道。 des Laumes（最后一个词似乎对加拉东和盖尔芒特来说很常见）。然后，看到德·弗罗伯维尔先生仍然注视着夫人。德·康布勒梅，她补充道，半是出于对这位女士的恶意，半是想满足将军的要求：“对她的丈夫来说……不太好！”很抱歉我不认识她，因为她似乎很吸引你； “我本来可以把你介绍给她的。”公主说道，如果她认识这个年轻女子，她很可能不会做这样的事情。 “现在我必须说晚安，因为我的一个朋友正在举办生日聚会，我必须去祝她一切顺利，”她谦虚而真实地解释道，减少了她要去参加的时尚聚会。仪式的简单程度可能会极其无聊，但她必须出席，而且她的外表会有些感人的地方。 “此外，我还得把盆子捡起来。”当我来这里的时候，他去看望了他的那些朋友——我确信你也认识他们——他们以一座桥的名字命名——哦，是的，耶纳斯一家。

‘It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!’ said the General. ‘I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,’ he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, ‘that Empire nobility, well, of course, it’s not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it’s very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes.’
“这是一座桥之前的一场战斗，公主；这是一场胜利！”将军说道。 “我的意思是，对像我这样的老士兵来说，”他继续说道，擦了擦单片眼镜并把它戴上，就好像他正在给下面的伤口敷上新的敷料，而公主本能地把目光移开，“那个帝国贵族嗯，当然，这不是同一件事，但是，毕竟，就其本身而言，它是同类中非常好的；他们是真正像英雄一样战斗的人。

‘But I have the deepest respect for heroes,’ the Princess assented, though with a faint trace of irony. ‘If I don’t go with Basin to see this Princesse d’Iéna, it isn’t for that, at all; it’s simply because I don’t know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it’s not what you think; he’s not in love with her. I’ve nothing to set my face against! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?’ she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. ‘Anyhow, it isn’t that at all. They’re people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he’s told me about their house; it’s quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their furniture is ‘Empire’!’
“但我对英雄怀有最深切的敬意。”公主同意道，尽管语气中带着一丝讽刺。 “如果我不和巴森一起去看这位耶娜公主，那根本不是为了这个；只是因为我不认识他们。盆地认识他们；他崇拜他们。哦，不，不是你想的那样；他不爱她。我没有什么可以反对的！再说了，当我公开反对他们的时候，又有什么好处呢？”她悲伤地问道，因为全世界都知道，自从洛姆斯王子与他迷人的表弟结婚那天起，他就一直不忠。给她。 「总之，根本不是那样的。」他们是他认识很久的人，他们对他非常好，这非常适合我。但我必须告诉你他告诉我关于他们房子的事情；已经足够了。你能想象吗，他们所有的家具都是‘帝国’！”

‘But, my dear Princess, that’s only natural; it belonged to their grandparents.’
“但是，我亲爱的公主，这是很自然的；它属于他们的祖父母。

‘I don’t quite say it didn’t, but that doesn’t make it any less ugly. I quite understand that people can’t always have nice things, but at least they needn’t have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous style—cabinets covered all over with swans’ heads, like bath-taps!’
“我并不是说没有，但这并没有让它变得不那么丑陋。我很明白，人不可能总是拥有美好的东西，但至少不需要拥有光怪陆离的东西。你怎么说？我想不出还有什么比那种丑陋的风格更具有破坏性、更自鸣得意的了——柜子里布满了天鹅的头，就像浴缸的水龙头一样！

‘But I believe, all the same, that they’ve got some lovely things; why, they must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...’
“但我仍然相信，他们有一些可爱的东西；为什么，他们一定有那张著名的马赛克桌子，上面写着……条约”

‘Oh, I don’t deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view. But things like that can’t, ever, be beautiful ... because they’re simply horrible! I’ve got things like that myself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they’re up in the attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that’s not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but—I don’t know them! D’you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn’t know.’ She assumed a tone of childish gravity. ‘And so I am just doing what I was taught to do. Can’t you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.’
‘哦，我不否认，从历史的角度来看，他们可能有足够有趣的东西。但这样的事情永远不会是美丽的……因为它们太可怕了！我自己也有类似的东西，是从孟德斯奇斯传到盆地的。只是，他们在盖尔芒特的阁楼上，没有人看到他们。但毕竟这不是重点，我会和盆地一起飞去看他们；如果我认识他们的话，我什至会去看他们的狮身人面像和黄铜，但是——我不认识他们！你知道吗，当我还是个小女孩的时候，我就被教导说拜访不认识的人是不礼貌的行为。”她的语气显得孩子气而严肃。 “所以我只是在做我被教导要做的事情。难道你没看到那些好人，一个完全陌生的女人闯进了他们的房子吗？为什么，我可能会受到最敌意的接待。

And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression.
她风骚地增强了这个想法带到她嘴唇上的微笑的魅力，让她的蓝眼睛盯着将军，一种温柔的、梦幻般的表情。

‘My dear Princess, you know that they’d be simply wild with joy.’
“我亲爱的公主，你知道他们会欣喜若狂。”

‘No, why?’ she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so. ‘Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if they’re anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people I do know; I’m sure if I had to see people I didn’t know as well, even if they had ‘fought like heroes,’ I should go stark mad. Besides, except when it’s an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I’m not sure that ‘heroism’ takes one very far in society. It’s often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one’s arm to Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big ‘crushes.’ And as I never give any...’
“不，为什么？”她极其活泼地问道，要么是为了显得没有意识到这是因为她是法国第一夫人之一，要么是为了很高兴听到将军这样告诉她。 '为什么？你怎么知道？也许他们会认为这是可能发生的最不愉快的事情。我对他们一无所知，但如果他们和我一样，我会觉得见到我认识的人就够无聊的了；我确信，如果我必须见到我不认识的人，即使他们“像英雄一样战斗”，我也会发疯。此外，除非是像你这样的老朋友，人们对他的认识很远，否则我不确定“英雄主义”能让一个人在社会上走得很远。举办一场晚宴通常已经够无聊的了，但如果有人必须向斯巴达克斯伸出一只手臂，让他把一只手臂打倒……！真的不;我永远不会派人去找维辛格托里克斯来制作第十四个。我确信，我应该留住他，以度过真正的“迷恋”。而且因为我从不给予任何……”

‘Ah! Princess, it’s easy to see you’re not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it, all right, the ‘wit of the Guermantes’!’
'啊！公主，很容易看出您不是无缘无故的盖尔芒特人。好吧，你也有你的一份，“盖尔芒特家族的智慧”！

‘But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could make out why. Do you really know any others who have it?’ she rallied him, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches—even if the Princess had to make them herself—as were in praise of h wit or of her beauty. ‘Look, there’s Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don’t you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!’
“但人们总是谈论盖尔芒特家族的智慧；我一直不明白为什么。你真的认识其他人吗？”她用涟漪般的笑声唤起他，她的五官集中，为她的动画服务，她的眼睛闪闪发光，闪耀着只有才能点燃的快乐的阳光。通过这样的演讲——即使公主必须自己做——就像赞扬她的智慧或她的美丽一样。 “看，斯万正在和你的坎布勒默女人说话；在那儿，在老圣埃弗特旁边，你没看到他吗？请他给你介绍一下。不过快点，他好像就要走了！”

‘Did you notice how dreadfully ill he’s looking?’ asked the General.
“你有没有注意到他看起来病得很厉害？”将军问道。

‘My precious Charles? Ah, he’s coming at last; I was beginning to think he didn’t want to see me!’
“我亲爱的查尔斯？啊，他终于来了；我开始以为他不想见我！

Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous—with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess—a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:
斯旺非常喜欢德洛梅公主，一看到她，他就想起了盖尔芒特，这座靠近贡布雷的庄园，以及他深爱着的整个国家，为了不与奥黛特分离，他不再去拜访这个国家。他养成了一种半艺术半多情的态度——他总能用这种方式取悦公主——每当他沉浸在旧的社会氛围中时，他就会很自然地表现出这种态度，并且也希望表达出为了满足他自己对国家的渴望，他说：

‘Ah!’ he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, ‘Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess.’
“啊！”他大声喊道，或者更确切地说，用一种能立即让夫人听到的方式吟诵。 de Saint-Euverte，他向他讲话，并与夫人。德洛梅斯，他为谁说话，“看我们迷人的公主！你看，她是特意从盖尔芒特来听圣方济各向鸟儿传教的，她才刚刚来得及，像一只可爱的小山雀，就去摘了一些小臀部和山楂，把它们插在自己的头发上。 ;甚至上面还残留着一些露珠，一点点白霜一定会让下面的公爵夫人发抖。它确实非常漂亮，我亲爱的公主。

‘What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that’s too wonderful! I never knew; I’m quite bewildered,’ Mme. de Saint-Euverte protested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann’s way of speaking. And then, examining the Princess’s headdress, ‘Why, you’re quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,—oh, it’s a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn’t tell me, even.’
'什么！公主是故意从盖尔芒特来的？但这也太美妙了吧！我一直都不知道;我很困惑，”女士。德·圣埃弗特以一种古怪而简单的方式提出抗议，他不太习惯斯万的说话方式。然后，检查公主的头饰，‘哦，你说得很对；’它是从……我该说什么呢，不是栗子，不，——哦，这是一个令人愉快的想法，但是公主怎么知道我的节目中会出现什么内容呢？音乐家们甚至没有告诉我。”

Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter, both because Swann’s wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing.
斯旺习惯于和一个他一直保持着殷勤称呼的女人在一起时，对她表示微妙的恭维，而大多数人不会也不需要理解，所以他没有屈尊向夫人解释。 de Saint-Euverte 说他一直在用隐喻的方式说话。至于公主，她笑得很开心，一方面是因为斯万的机智受到了她的剧组的高度赞赏，另一方面是因为她每次听到对自己的赞美都会觉得它微妙而令人难以抗拒的有趣。

‘Indeed! I’m delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you also her neighbour in the country?’
'的确！查尔斯，如果我的小屁股和山楂得到你的认可，我很高兴。但是告诉我，你为什么要向那个康布勒梅人鞠躬，你也是她在乡下的邻居吗？

Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann, had drifted away.
女士。德·圣埃维尔特见公主似乎很高兴与斯万交谈，就走开了。

‘But you are, yourself, Princess!’
“但你就是你自己，公主！”

‘I! Why, they must have ‘countries’ everywhere, those creatures! Don’t I wish I had!’
'我！哎呀，这些生物，他们一定到处都有“国家”！我不希望我有吗！

‘No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to come to Combray. I don’t know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.’
“不，不是康布雷默人；她自己的人。她是勒格朗丁人，常来贡布雷。我不知道你是否知道你是贡布雷伯爵夫人，分会欠你一份应得的报酬。

‘I don’t know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I’m ‘touched’ for a hundred francs, every year, by the Curé, which is a due that I could very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!’ she said with a laugh.
“我不知道分会欠我什么，但我知道每年我都会被本堂神‘感动’一百法郎，这是我完全可以没有的欠款。”但可以肯定的是，这些坎布尔马有一个相当惊人的名字。它及时结束了，但结局很糟糕！”她笑着说。

‘It begins no better.’ Swann took the point.
“一切都开始不了了之。”斯旺明白了这一点。

‘Yes; that double abbreviation!’
'是的;那个双重缩写！’

‘Some one very angry and very proper who didn’t dare to finish the first word.’
“一个非常生气又非常正经的人，不敢把第一个字说完。”

‘But since he couldn’t stop himself beginning the second, he’d have done better to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of taste—but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,’ she went on in a coaxing tone, ‘I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name Cam-bremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It’s only when I see you that I stop feeling bored.’
“但既然他无法阻止自己开始第二个，他最好完成第一个并结束它。我们正在沉浸在最精致的幽默中，我亲爱的查尔斯，在最好的品味中——但是我现在再也见不到你了，这是多么令人厌烦，”她用哄骗的语气继续说道，“我真的很喜欢和你说话。你。想象一下，我无法让弗罗伯维尔那个白痴看出康布雷默这个名字有什么有趣的地方。确实同意生活是一件可怕的事情。只有当我看到你时，我才不再感到无聊。”

Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life—the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann’s utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the ‘tone’ of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette.
这可能不是真的。但斯旺和公主看待生活中的小事的方式是一样的——其结果，如果不是原因，就是他们的表达方式甚至发音之间的密切相似。这种相似性并不引人注目，因为没有两件事比他们的声音更不同了。但是，如果有人费心去想象斯万的话语，去掉了包裹着它们的响亮声，去掉了它们出现的小胡子，就会发现它们是相同的短语，相同的语调，具有盖尔芒特家族的“语气”。放。在重要问题上，斯旺和公主没有共同的想法。但由于斯万变得如此忧郁，总是处于颤抖的状态，然后泪流满面，他有同样的需要讲述他的悲伤，就像一个杀人犯必须告诉别人他的罪行一样。当他听到公主说生活是一件可怕的事情时，他感到非常安慰，就好像她向他谈到了奥黛特一样。

‘Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear friend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could spend a most pleasant evening together.’
“是的，生活是一件可怕的事情！我们必须经常见面，我亲爱的朋友。你的优点就是你不开朗。我们可以一起度过一个最愉快的夜晚。

‘I’m sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It’s supposed to be very ugly down there, but I must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror of ‘picturesque spots’.’
“我确信我们可以；为什么不来盖尔芒特呢？我婆婆一定会高兴极了。那里本来应该很丑陋，但我必须说，我发现这个街区一点也不缺乏吸引力；我对“风景如画的地方”感到恐惧。

‘I know it well, it’s delightful!’ replied Swann. ‘It’s almost too beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it’s a country to be happy in. It’s perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water’s edge... I should be quite wretched!’
“我很了解，这太令人愉快了！”斯旺回答道。 “对于目前的我来说，它太美丽了，太有活力了；”这是一个让人感到快乐的国家。也许是因为我曾经住过那里，但那里的事物对我来说也是如此。一阵风起，玉米地开始骚动，我就感觉有人会突然出现，我会听到什么消息；还有那些水边的小房子……我应该很可怜吧！

‘Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there’s that appalling Rampillon woman; she’s seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what it was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she’s just married off her daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),—perhaps both—to each other! Oh, no, I remember now, she’s been dropped by her Prince... Pretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha’n’t come and invite me to dinner. Anyhow, I’m going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won’t you let me carry you off and take you to the Princesse de Parme’s, who would be so pleased to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he’s meeting me there. If one didn’t get news of you, sometimes, from Mémé... Remember, I never see you at all now!’
'哦！我最亲爱的查尔斯，保重；还有那个可怕的朗皮永女人；她见过我；把我藏在某个地方，快点再告诉我一次，她发生了什么事；我很困惑；她刚刚与她的女儿或她的情人（我记不清了）——也许是两者——结婚了！哦，不，我现在想起来了，她被她的王子抛弃了……假装在说话，这样可怜的老贝蕾妮丝就不会来邀请我吃饭了。无论如何，我要去。听着，我最亲爱的查尔斯，既然我已经见到你了，千载难逢，你能不能让我带你去帕尔马​​公主家，她会很高兴见到你（你知道），就此而言，还有盆地；他在那里见我。有时，如果有人没有从梅梅那里得到你的消息……记住，我现在再也见不到你了！”

Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the risk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme’s, of missing a message which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter, at home.
斯旺拒绝了。告诉德·夏吕斯先生这一点后，离开夫人。 de Saint-Euverte's，他会直接回家，他不想冒风险，现在前往帕尔马公主的家，错过他一直希望看到的信息聚会期间，一名男仆写的，他也许会在家里找到它，留在自己的搬运工那里。

‘Poor Swann,’ said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; ‘he is always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel that it’s really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn’t even interesting, for they tell me, she’s an absolute idiot!’ she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus.
“可怜的斯万，”夫人说。那天晚上，德斯·洛姆斯对她的丈夫说： “他总是很有魅力，但他看起来确实非常不高兴。你会亲眼看到的，因为他答应有一天会和我们一起吃饭。我确实觉得，一个像他这样聪明的人竟然让自己遭受那种毫无趣味的生物的折磨，这真是荒谬，因为他们告诉我，她绝对是个白痴！”她用智慧总结道。那些自己并不恋爱的人总是表现出这种倾向，他们认为聪明人应该只对那些值得他花时间的人感到不高兴。这就像惊讶地发现，居然有人在普通杆菌这样微不足道的生物的命令下屈尊死于霍乱。

Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape, General de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme. de Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her.
斯旺现在想回家，但是，正当他逃跑时，德·弗罗伯维尔将军抓住了他，并要求把他介绍给夫人。 de Cambremer，他不得不回到房间去找她。

‘I say, Swann, I’d rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages, what do you say?’
“我说，斯旺，我宁愿嫁给那个小女人，也不愿被野蛮人杀死，你说呢？”

The words ‘killed by savages’ pierced Swann’s aching heart; and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation. ‘Ah!’ he began, ‘some fine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer whose remains Dumont d’Urville brought back, La Pérouse...’ (and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). ‘He was a fine character, and interests me very much, does La Pérouse,’ he ended sadly.
“被野蛮人杀害”这三​​个字刺痛了斯旺的心。他立刻觉得有必要继续谈话。 “啊！”他开始说道，“一些美好的生命就这样失去了……你记得，杜蒙·迪维尔带回了那位探险家的遗体，拉·佩鲁斯……”（他立刻高兴起来再次，就好像他给奥黛特起了名字一样）。 “他是一个很好的人物，我很感兴趣，拉佩鲁斯也是如此，”他悲伤地结束道。

‘Oh, yes, of course, La Pérouse,’ said the General. ‘It’s quite a well-known name. There’s a street called that.’
“哦，是的，当然，拉彼鲁斯，”将军说。 ‘这真是一个众所周知的名字。有一条街叫那条街。”

‘Do you know anyone in the Rue La Pérouse?’ asked Swann excitedly.
“你在拉佩鲁斯街上认识什么人吗？”斯旺兴奋地问道。

‘Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That’s a house that will be really smart some day, you’ll see!’
“只有夫人。”德·尚利沃（de Chanlivault），那个好朋友肖斯皮埃尔（Chaussepierre）的妹妹。那天晚上她举办了一场非常有趣的戏剧晚会。你会看到，有一天这栋房子会变得非常聪明！”

‘Oh, so she lives in the Rue La Pérouse. It’s attractive; I like that street; it’s so sombre.’
“哦，原来她住在拉佩鲁斯街。”它很有吸引力；我喜欢那条街；太阴沉了。

‘Indeed it isn’t. You can’t have been in it for a long time; it’s not at all sombre now; they’re beginning to build all round there.’
‘确实不是。你不可能已经在其中呆了很长时间；现在一点也不阴沉了；他们开始在那里建造。

When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General’s name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard ‘such a lot about him’ since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune.
当斯旺最终将德弗罗伯维尔先生介绍给年轻的夫人时。德·康布尔梅，因为这是她第一次听到将军的名字，她急忙在嘴唇上勾勒出喜悦和惊讶的微笑，如果她一生中从未听到过任何事情，她也会用这种微笑来迎接他。别的;因为，由于她还不认识新家庭的所有朋友，所以每当有人出现在她面前时，她就认为他一定是其中之一，并认为她会表现出听过“这么多”的机智。自从结婚以来，每当谈到他时，她都会带着犹豫的神情伸出手来，这既证明了她必须克服的被灌输的矜持，也证明了她成功地克服了她自发的友善。因此，她的公公婆婆，她仍然认为他们是法国最杰出的一对，宣布她是天使；更重要的是，他们在把她嫁给他们的儿子时，更愿意表现出是屈服于她的自然魅力而不是她的巨额财富的吸引力。

‘It’s easy to see that you’re a musician heart and soul, Madame,’ said the General, alluding to the incident of the candle.
“很容易看出您是一位全心全意的音乐家，女士，”将军在提到蜡烛事件时说道。

Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent.
与此同时，音乐会又开始了，斯旺发现自己不能在新曲目结束之前离开。他因被关在这些人中间而遭受极大的痛苦，这些人的愚蠢和荒谬对他的伤害更加残酷，因为他对他的爱一无所知，即使他们知道，他也无法对此产生任何兴趣，或者除了微笑之外，他也无法采取任何行动。就像在某些幼稚的笑话中，或者将其视为疯狂行为一样，他们让他以一种主观状态的形式出现，这种状态只为他自己而存在，其真实性没有任何外在的东西可以证实。他承受着巨大的痛苦，甚至连乐器的声音都让他想哭，因为他不得不在这个奥黛特永远不会来的地方延长流放时间，在那里没有人，没有任何人知道她的存在，从她完全缺席了。

But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: ‘It is the little phrase from Vinteuil’s sonata. I mustn’t listen!’, all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness.
但突然之间，她好像进来了，这个幻影让他痛苦万分，他的手冲动地伸向心口。所发生的事情是，小提琴已经升到了一系列的高音，它停在这个音上，仿佛在期待着什么，这种期待一直持续着，但它并没有停止抓住音符，在兴奋中，它已经看到了期待的对象。正在逼近，并拼命地努力继续，直到它到来，在它消失之前欢迎它，用它剩余的力量让道路多开一会儿，以便陌生人可以进来，就像一个人打开一扇门一样否则会自动关闭。斯旺还没来得及明白发生了什么，他就想：“这是万特伊奏鸣曲中的小乐句。”我不能听！”他对奥黛特爱上他的日子的所有记忆，直到那天晚上，他都成功地在他的内心深处隐藏起来，被这突然的一种反射所欺骗。他们认为，爱情的季节，太阳已经再次升起，从沉睡中醒来，展开翅膀，在他耳边疯狂地歌唱，对他目前的荒凉和被遗忘的幸福旋律毫不怜悯。

In place of the abstract expressions ‘the time when I was happy,’ ‘the time when I was loved,’ which he had often used until then, and without much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address ‘Maison Dorée,’ embossed on the note-paper on which he had read ‘My hand trembles so as I write to you,’ the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly: ‘You won’t let it be very long before you send for me?’; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: ‘But I can see you at any time; I am always free!’—she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour—of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements—of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins’; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: ‘But why don’t you let me come to you oftener?’ he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. ‘Written from the Hôtel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?’ He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was himself.
在此之前，他经常使用“我快乐的时候”、“我被爱的时候”这样的抽象表达，而没有太多痛苦，因为他的智慧除了过去的一切外，并没有体现在这些表达中。虚构的摘录没有保留任何现实，他现在恢复了一切，这些东西已经不可改变地固定了失去的幸福的奇特的、易变的本质。他可以看到这一切；雪白、卷曲的菊花花瓣，是她随他扔进他的马车里的，他一直把车贴在嘴唇上，地址“Maison Dorée”，浮雕在便条纸上，上面写着“我的手颤抖得厉害”。当我写信给你时，”当她恳求地说：“你不会等太久才派人来找我吗？当洛雷登去接那个小女工时，他能闻到他过去常去理发店烫头发的熨斗的味道。能感觉到那年春天经常下的倾盆大雨，在月光下，在维多利亚的路上冰冷地回家；所有的心理习惯、及时的印象、感官反应的网络，在几周的时间里一直延伸到其统一的网格中，现在他的身体发现自己被这些网格牢牢地束缚住了。那时他一直在满足一种感性的好奇心，想知道那些只为爱情而活的人到底有什么乐趣。他本以为他可以就此打住，他不必也了解他们的悲伤；与那种可怕的恐惧相比，奥黛特的真正魅力是多么微不足道，这种恐惧像一个阴云般的光环笼罩在她周围，那种巨大的痛苦，因为她不知道自己在白天和晚上的每时每刻都在做什么，不知道自己在做什么。无论何时何地，都要完全占有她！ 唉，他想起了她惊呼时的口音：“但我随时都可以见到你；”我永远是自由的！’——她，现在从来没有自由过；她对他的生活表现出的兴趣和好奇，她热切地希望他能帮她忙——当时他对此感到怀疑，因为这可能是一种乏味的浪费他的时间和干扰他的生活。安排——允许她进入他的学习；她是如何被迫恳求他让她带他去维尔迪兰家的？当他允许她每个月来找他一次时，在他让自己动摇之前，她必须首先向她重复，他们每天见面的习惯将是多么快乐，因为她曾经渴望过这样的生活，而对他来说，这似乎只是一种令人厌烦的消遣，从那时起，她就对此产生了厌恶，并彻底摆脱了它，而对他来说，它变得如此贪得无厌，如此悲伤。需要。当他们第三次见面时，他几乎没有怀疑过他说的话是多么真实，正如她重复的那样：“但是你为什么不让我经常来找你呢？”他笑着告诉她，并以一种殷勤的态度，是因为害怕形成一种无望的激情。现在，唉，有时她仍然会在餐馆或旅馆给他写信，纸上写着地址，但字迹却灼灼着他的心。 '写于武耶蒙酒店。她到底去那里做什么？和谁一起？那里发生了什么？他记得当他遇见她时，意大利大道上的燃气喷射器正在熄灭，当时所有的希望都在那个夜晚的飘忽不定的阴影中消失了，这个夜晚对他来说几乎是超自然的，而现在（某个时期的那个夜晚）当他甚至不用问自己是否会因寻找她和找到她而惹恼她时，他就如此确定，以至于她知道没有比见到他并让他带她回家更大的幸福了）确实属于一个神秘的人一旦大门关闭，人们就再也回不去的世界。斯万能够辨认出，他一动不动地站在那片幸福的场景前，那是一个让他充满怜悯的可怜人，因为他一开始没认出那人是谁，所以他必须低下头，免得有人看见。应该看到他的眼睛里充满了泪水。是他自己。

When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that other self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said, without much suffering: ‘Perhaps she’s in love with them,’ now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the ‘letter-heading’ of the Maison d’Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares.
当他意识到这一点时，他的怜悯就停止了；现在，他嫉妒她所爱的另一个自己，他嫉妒那些他经常说起的男人，没有太多痛苦：“也许她爱上了他们，”既然他已经交换了模糊的想法对菊花花瓣和金宫“信头”的爱，其中没有爱；因为他们充满了爱。然后，他的痛苦变得太强烈了，他把手放在额头上，让单片眼镜从眼睛上掉下来，擦了擦玻璃。毫无疑问，如果他在那一刻看到了自己，他就会把单片眼镜添加到他已经认出的单片眼镜的收藏中，这个他像一个纠缠不休的、令人担忧的想法一样，从他的脑海中删除了，同时又从他的脑海中删除了。雾蒙蒙的表面，他用手帕试图抹去他的忧虑。

There are in the music of the violin—if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound—accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one’s eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message.
小提琴的音乐中存在着与某些女低音非常相似的重音——如果人们没有看到乐器本身，就无法将所听到的内容与其形式联系起来，从而改变了声音的丰满度——那个人有一种错觉，好像有一位歌手在管弦乐队中取代了她的位置。一个人抬起眼睛；只见木盒，神奇如中国盒子；但有时，人们仍然会被海妖的欺骗性吸引力所欺骗。有时，人们也相信自己正在聆听一个被俘虏的灵魂，在其强大的盒子的黑暗中挣扎，这个盒子因魔法而颤抖，就像一个沉浸在圣水中的魔鬼；有时，它再次出现在空气中，就像一个纯粹而超自然的生物，当它经过时，向耳朵透露它看不见的信息。

As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form.
就好像音乐家们并不是在演奏这个小乐句，而是在执行它在同意出现之前所坚持的仪式，而是开始念出必要的咒语，以实现它的奇迹，并延长几分钟。幻影，斯万，他现在看不到它，就好像它属于一个紫外线世界一样，他在接近时所经历的短暂失明中体验到了一种令人耳目一新的变形感。斯旺觉得它就在眼前，就像一位保护女神，一位他爱人的知己，为了能够穿过人群来到他身边，把他拉到一边与他说话，她把自己伪装成这样扫斗篷的声音。当她从他身边走过时，轻柔、舒缓，像花香一样轻声呢喃，告诉他她要说的话，他仔细地浏览着每一个字，遗憾地看到它们飞得那么快，他不由自主地用他的眼睛嘴唇是亲吻的动作，当它经过他时，和谐而短暂的形式。

He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it—without his being touched by them himself—carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once it had said of his happiness: ‘What does all that matter; it is all nothing.’ And Swann’s thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown, exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?
自从她向他说话，用奥黛特的低声对他说话以来，他觉得自己不再是流亡者和孤独者了。因为他不再像以前那样认为奥黛特和他不认识这句话。这不是常常见证他们的欢乐吗？确实，它一如既往地警告他他们的脆弱。事实上，在那个遥远的时光里，他在它的微笑中，在它清澈而幻灭的语调中，预感到了一种痛苦的元素，而今晚，他却发现了一种几乎是快乐的顺从的魅力。那些悲伤，那些小词当时对他说的，那些他亲眼所见的——而他自己并没有被它们所触动——带着微笑，在它蜿蜒而快速的过程中，那些现在已经成为他的悲伤的悲伤。它似乎在对他说，就像它曾经谈到他的幸福一样：“这一切又有什么关系呢？”斯旺的思绪第一次对那个万特伊、对那个同样遭受了如此巨大痛苦的不知名的、崇高的兄弟产生了怜悯和温柔。他的生活会怎样？他能从怎样的悲伤深处汲取神一般的力量、无限的创造力量呢？

When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance. ‘Twas because the little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, ‘twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers—provided only that they were in any sense musical—who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins’, he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind’s convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind’s eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Clèves, or of René, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil’s phrase, like some theme, say, in Tristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain.
当这句话向他诉说他的痛苦是虚无的时候，斯旺在这种智慧中找到了一种甜蜜，就在不久前，当他认为他可以从人们的脸上读出这种智慧时，他似乎无法忍受。冷漠的陌生人，他们会认为他的爱是无关紧要的题外话。这是因为，这个小短语与它们不同，无论它对这些灵魂状态的短暂持续时间持有什么看法，在它们中看到的东西并不像其他人所看到的那样，不像日常生活中的事件那么严重，而是在相反，它远远优于日常生活，以至于值得单独表达它。这句话试图模仿、重新创造出那些隐秘的悲伤的优雅；正是这些优雅。就连它们的本质，尽管它是无法传达的，而且对每个人来说都是微不足道的，除了经历过它们的人之外，这句话已经捕捉到了这一点，但它们的本质却变得可见。如此之多，以至于它使它们的价值得到承认，它们神圣的甜蜜被所有那些相同的旁观者品尝到——只要它们在任何意义上都是音乐的——下一刻，他们就会忽视，会在现实生活中、在每一个方面与它们断绝关系。个人的爱情在他们的眼皮底下形成。毫无疑问，它编纂这些恩典的形式不能被分析成任何逻辑元素。 但自从一年多前，斯旺发现了自己灵魂的许多财富，对音乐的热爱就诞生了，并且至少在一段时间内在他心中扎根，斯旺就将音乐主题视为实际的想法，另一个世界、另一个秩序的观念，隐藏在阴影中的观念，是未知的，人类心灵无法理解的，但它们彼此之间却完全不同，它们之间的价值和意义是不平等的。在维尔迪兰家的第一个晚上之后，当他再次听到这句话时，他试图从他混乱的印象中解脱出来，它是如何像香水或爱抚一样席卷并笼罩他的他观察到，构成这首曲子的五个音之间的间隔非常接近，而且其中两个音的不断重复，才给人一种冰冷、收缩的甜蜜的印象。但事实上，他知道他的结论并不是基于这个短语本身，而只是基于某些等价物，（为了他的头脑的方便）取代了他在认识维尔迪兰夫妇之前就已经意识到的神秘实体。早些时候的聚会，当时他第一次听到奏鸣曲演奏。 他知道他对钢琴的记忆进一步歪曲了他看待音乐的视角，对音乐家开放的领域不是一个可怜的七个音符的五线谱，而是一个不可估量的键盘（仍然，几乎所有的键盘，未知） ，在这上面和那里，只有在其未探索过的大片的黑暗中，有数以百万计的钥匙中的一些钥匙，温柔的钥匙，激情的钥匙，勇气的钥匙，平静的钥匙，组成了它，每一个都不同于所有的钥匙。某些伟大的艺术家发现了一个宇宙与另一个宇宙不同的休息，他们为我们服务，当他们唤醒我们内心与他们所发现的主题相对应的情感时，向我们展示隐藏着、未知的丰富性和多样性。我们，在那个漆黑难透的夜晚，令人沮丧地探索我们的灵魂，我们一直满足于认为它毫无价值、浪费和空虚。万特伊就是这些音乐家之一。在他那短短的一句话中，虽然给人的眼睛呈现出一种阴暗的表面，但人们感觉到，其中包含着一种如此一致、如此明确的东西，这句话赋予了它如此新的、如此原始的力量，以至于那些曾经听过的人它把关于它的记忆保存在他们心灵的宝库中。斯旺会以爱与幸福的概念来修复它，他立刻就知道它在哪些方面是奇特的，就像他知道克雷维斯公主或勒内（如果他想到这些头衔中的任何一个）一样。 。即使当他没有想到这个小短语时，它也潜伏在他的脑海中，就像某些其他没有物质等同物的概念一样，例如我们对光、声音、透视、身体欲望、丰富的财产使我们的内殿变得多样化和装饰。 如果我们归于尘埃，也许我们会失去它们，也许它们会被抹去。但是，只要我们还活着，我们就不可能使自己处于一种我们不认识它们的状态，就像我们不能对任何物质对象一样，例如，我们不能怀疑一盏灯的亮度，刚刚被点燃，房间里的一切都发生了变化，甚至连黑暗的记忆也消失了。这样，万特伊的短语，就像《特里斯坦》中的某些主题一样，对我们来说也代表了某种情感的获得，拥护了我们的凡人状态，赋予了足够影响力的人性外衣。它的未来命运与人类灵魂的命运息息相关，它是人类灵魂中最特殊、最独特的装饰品之一。也许“不存在”才是真正的状态，而我们所有的人生梦想都是“不存在”；但是，如果是这样，我们就会觉得这些音乐乐句、这些与我们的梦有关的概念也毫无意义。我们将会灭亡，但我们有这些神圣的俘虏作为我们的人质，他们将跟随我们并分享我们的命运。和他们在一起，死亡就不再那么痛苦，不再那么不光彩，甚至可能更不确定。

So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand.
因此，斯万相信奏鸣曲的乐句确实存在，这一点并没有错误。从这个角度来看，尽管它是人类，但它仍属于超自然生物的一类，我们从未见过它们，但尽管如此，当某些看不见的探索者发明时，我们还是会欣喜若狂地认出它们并欢呼雀跃。哄骗一个人，把它从那个神圣的世界带下来，他可以在这个神圣的世界里短暂地在我们的天空中闪耀。这就是凡特伊为这个小短语所做的。斯旺觉得作曲家（用他所使用的乐器）已经满足于揭开它的面纱，使其可见，用一只如此慈爱、如此谨慎、如此精致和如此确定的手遵循和尊重它的轮廓，以至于声音每时每刻都在变化，钝化自己以指示阴影，当它必须遵循一些更大胆的投影曲线时，它又会重新焕发活力。斯旺相信这句话的真实存在并没有弄错的一个证据是，任何对音乐有敏锐耳朵的人都会立即察觉到万特伊的欺骗，因为他被赋予了较少的能力来看到和呈现它的声音。形式，试图掩饰（通过在各处添加他自己发明的线条）他的视力的模糊或他的手的无力。

The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin’s pianist always ‘skipped.’ There were in this passage some admirable ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. ‘Audacity,’ he exclaimed to himself, ‘as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier’s or an Ampere’s, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!’ How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium’s the body of the violinist, ‘possessed’ indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: ‘It’s astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...’ But a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added the reservation: ‘anything to beat it... since the table-turning!’
这句话已经消失了。斯万知道，在最后一个乐章结束时，经过夫人的一段很长的段落之后，它会再次出现。维尔迪兰的钢琴家总是“跳过”。在这段文字中，有一些令人钦佩的想法，斯万第一次听到奏鸣曲时并没有区分出来，而现在他发现了这些想法，仿佛它们在他记忆的衣帽间里脱去了统一的伪装。的新颖性。斯万聆听了构成该短语的所有分散的主题，因为它的前提进入了三段论的不可避免的结论。他正在协助解开它的诞生之谜。 “大胆，”他对自己感叹道，“也许就像拉瓦锡或安培的大胆一样，凡特伊做实验的大胆，发现了控制未知力量的秘密法则，驱车穿过一个未经探索的区域，朝着一个可能的目标前进。” “他信任一支看不见的团队，但他却永远无法辨别！”在最后一段的开头，斯旺现在听到钢琴和小提琴之间的对话是多么迷人。对人类言语的压制，远没有让幻想不受控制地统治那里（正如人们可能想象的那样），而是完全消除了它。口头语言从来没有如此僵化的必要性，它从来没有知道如此相关的问题，如此明显的答复。起初，钢琴独自抱怨，就像一只被伴侣遗弃的小鸟；小提琴听到并回应了它，就像来自邻近的树一样。就好像世界刚开始的时候，地球上，或者更确切地说，在这个世界上，除了这两个人之外，还没有其他人，按照其创造者的逻辑，在这个世界上永远不应该有其他人。除了他们自己之外的任何人；这首奏鸣曲的世界。 它是一只鸟，是那小乐句尚未完善的灵魂，是一位仙女，在无形的某处哀叹，钢琴听到并温柔地重复着她的哀诉吗？它的叫声如此突然，以至于小提琴家必须抓起弓，跑去抓住它们。奇妙的鸟！小提琴家似乎希望吸引、驯服、吸引、赢得它。它已经进入了他的灵魂，它所唤起的那个小短语已经像媒介一样震动了小提琴家的身体，确实“占有”了。斯旺知道这句话将再次对他说话。他的性格现在如此分裂，以至于等待即将到来的时刻的紧张，当他发现自己再次面对面时，与这句话，使他在抽泣中抽搐，就像一首优美的诗句或一首令人震惊的作品一样。我们会从我们嘴里听到消息，不是当我们独自一人时，而是当我们向朋友重复其中一个或另一个时，我们在朋友身上看到了自己的影子，就像第三个人一样，他的情绪可能会软化他。它又出现了，但这次是在空中保持静止状态，只运动了一会儿，仿佛一动不动，很快就消失了。因此斯旺并没有失去它所停留的宝贵时间。它仍然在那里，就像一个彩虹色的气泡，漂浮了一段时间，没有破裂。就像彩虹，当它的亮度消退时，似乎会消退，然后又再次升起，在熄灭之前，会以前所未有的辉煌而荣耀；因此，除了这句话迄今为止允许出现的两种颜色之外，现在它还添加了其他颜色，用棱镜中的每种色调发出和弦，并使它们歌唱。 斯万不敢动，他很想强迫房间里的其他人也保持静止，仿佛最轻微的动作都会让这个神奇的存在感到尴尬，超自然的、美味的、脆弱的，很容易消失。但事实上，没有人梦想开口说话。一个孤独的人缺席了，也许已经死了（斯万不知道万特伊是否还活着），在这两位圣人的仪式上方呼出的难以言喻的话语，足以吸引三百人的注意力，并让那个舞台成为现实。因此，灵魂被称为最高贵的祭坛之一，可以在上面举行超自然的仪式。接下来，当这句话终于结束时，只有它的碎片回响漂浮在随后已经取代它的主题中，如果斯旺一开始很恼火地看到以愚蠢闻名的德蒙特里安德伯爵夫人倾身于甚至在奏鸣曲结束之前，他就向他吐露了她的印象。他忍不住笑了，或许还从她的话语中发现了她无法察觉的深意。伯爵夫人被表演者的精湛技艺所折服，她对斯万惊叹道：“太令人惊讶了！我从来没有见过任何可以打败它的东西......”但是，出于对准确性的严格考虑，她纠正了她的第一个断言，她补充了保留意见：“任何可以打败它的东西......自从逆转以来！’

>From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as significant facts of infinite value: ‘Yesterday he went through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,’—although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go.
从那天晚上起，斯万就明白了，奥黛特曾经对他产生的感情永远不会再出现，他对幸福的希望现在也不会实现了。幸运的是，在那些日子里，她再次对他表现出友善和爱意，或者如果她对他有任何关注，他就会记录下她对他的轻微动作的明显和误导性的迹象，并用同样的温柔和怀疑的关怀，人们在照顾患有不治之症的最后几天的朋友时所表现出的绝望的喜悦，将其视为具有无限价值的重要事实：“昨天他亲自检查了他的账目，实际上更正了我们在将它们相加时犯了一个错误；他今天吃了一个鸡蛋，看起来很享受，如果他消化得好，我们明天就用肉排来试试他。”——尽管他们自己知道，在不可避免的死亡前夕，这些事情毫无意义。毫无疑问，斯旺确信，如果他现在远离奥黛特，他就会逐渐对她失去所有兴趣，因此他会很高兴得知她将永远离开巴黎；他会有勇气留在那里；但他没有勇气去。

He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a ‘Toilet of Diana’ which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there—for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain—was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette’s vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position—his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)—his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem—and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette —he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: ‘People don’t know when they are happy. They’re never so unhappy as they think they are.’ But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams—his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed.
他常常想到要去。现在他再次开始写关于维米尔的论文，他想返回海牙、德累斯顿、布伦瑞克，至少几天。他确信，莫瑞泰斯皇家美术馆在戈德施密特拍卖会上以尼古拉斯·梅斯的作品购得的《戴安娜的厕所》实际上是维米尔的作品。而他更希望能够现场查看这幅画，以坚定自己的信念。但是当奥黛特在的时候离开巴黎，甚至当她不在的时候——因为在陌生的地方，我们的感觉没有被习惯麻木，我们焕然一新，我们复活了旧的痛苦——对他来说是一个如此残酷的计划，他觉得他自己之所以能够在心里不断地思考这件事，只是因为他知道自己下定决心永远不会把它付诸实施。但有时，当他睡着的时候，旅行的意图会在他心中重新苏醒（他不记得这次旅行是不可能的）并得以实现。一天晚上，他梦见自己要离开一年。他从车窗探出身子，向月台上一个哭泣着告别的年轻人，试图劝说这个年轻人也走开。火车开始行驶；他惊醒了，想起自己不会离开，那天晚上、第二天、几乎每一天他都会见到奥黛特。 然后，他仍然被自己的梦想深深感动，他会感谢上天赐予他那些特殊的环境，使他能够独立，这样他就可以留在奥黛特的附近，甚至可以成功地让她允许他有时见到她；因为这样他就可以留在奥黛特身边，甚至可以成功地让她允许他有时见到她。而且，数一数他的优点：他的社会地位——他的财富，她经常需要帮助，不能回避明确破裂的前景（人们说，她甚至有一个不可告人的计划）他与德·夏吕斯先生的友谊，必须承认，他从未从奥黛特那里赢得过任何很大的好感，但这给了他一种愉快的感觉，因为她总是听到德·夏吕斯先生对他的赞美之词。这位她非常尊敬的普通朋友——甚至还有他自己的智慧，他每天都用他的全部智慧来编织一个新的情节，这将使他的存在，即使不令人愉快，至少对奥黛特来说是必要的——他想到，如果缺乏所有这些优势，他可能会发生什么，他想，如果他像许多其他人一样，贫穷而卑微，没有资源，被迫承担任何可能提供给他的任务，或者受到父母或妻子的束缚，他可能不得不与奥黛特分开，那个梦，虽然最近才感到恐怖，但很可能是真的；他对自己说：“人们不知道什么时候幸福。”他们从来没有像他们想象的那么不快乐。但他想到，这种存在已经持续了好几年了，他现在所能希望的就是这种存在能够永远持续下去，他愿意牺牲他的工作、他的快乐、他的朋友，实际上是他的整个生命。每天都期待着一次会面，但一旦见面，他并不会感到快乐。他问自己是否没有弄错，有利于他们关系并避免最终决裂的环境是否没有对他的职业生涯造成损害，所期望的结果是否不是他所高兴的结果只在梦中——他自己的离去；他对自己说，人们不知道什么时候不快乐，他们从来没有像他们想象的那样快乐。

Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette’s very life.
有时他希望她能在某种事故中无痛地死去，她从早到晚都在街上，穿过繁忙的大道。当她总是安然无恙地回来时，他对人体的力量和柔韧性感到惊讶，人体能够不断地控制住，战胜周围的所有危险（对斯万来说，这些危险似乎是无数的，因为他自己的身体）秘密的欲望把它们散布在她的道路上），因此允许它的占有者，灵魂，日复一日地抛弃自己，几乎不受惩罚地从事撒谎的事业，追求快乐。斯万对穆罕默德二世怀有一种非常诚挚的同情，他欣赏贝里尼为穆罕默德二世绘制的肖像，当穆罕默德二世发现自己疯狂地爱上了自己的一位妻子时，刺伤了她，正如他的威尼斯传记作者天真地描述的那样，为了挽回痛苦，他刺伤了她。他的精神自由。那么他就会为只考虑自己而感到羞愧，既然他自己如此廉价地处置了奥黛特的生命，那么他自己的痛苦似乎就不值得怜悯。

Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would, perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate through all Swann’s defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile: ‘Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He’s going to Egypt!’ and Swann had at once understood that this meant: ‘I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.’ And, in fact, if, a few days later, Swann began: ‘About that trip that you told me you were going to take with Forcheville,’ she would answer carelessly: ‘Yes, my dear boy, we’re starting on the l9th; we’ll send you a ‘view’ of the Pyramids.’ Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville’s mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her.
既然他无法与她分离而不再回来，如果至少他能不断地见到她，不分离的话，他的悲伤最终会得到缓解，他的爱也许也会死去。从她不想永远离开巴黎的那一刻起，他就希望她永远不要离开。因为他知道她每年都会在八月和九月缺席一次，所以他有充足的机会，提前几个月，将她在永恒中缺席的可怕景象从其中分离出来，这种景象因预期而存在于他心中，并且使他无法摆脱这种痛苦。那些与他当时所经历的日子非常相似的日子，在他的脑海中以冰冷的透明度漂浮着，这让他感到悲伤和沮丧，尽管没有给他带来任何难以忍受的痛苦。但那种对未来的构想，那条流动的溪流，无色无拘无束，奥黛特的一句话就足以穿透斯万的所有防线，像一块冰块将其固定住，凝结了其流动性，使其完全冻结；斯万感觉自己突然充满了一个巨大的、牢不可破的东西，压在他意识的内壁上，直到他想要爆裂开来。因为奥黛特带着恶意的微笑看着他，漫不经心地说：“福什维尔将在圣灵降临节进行一次愉快的旅行。他要去埃及！”斯万立刻明白这意味着：“我要和福什维尔一起在圣灵降临节去埃及。”事实上，如果几天后，斯万开始说：“关于你告诉的那次旅行你要带我去福什维尔，”她漫不经心地回答道：“是的，我亲爱的孩子，我们从十九号开始；我们将向您发送金字塔的“视图”。’然后他决心要知道她是否是福什维尔的情妇，要直截了当地问她，坚持要她告诉他。他知道，有些伪证是她如此迷信的，她不会做的，此外，迄今为止一直抑制着他的好奇心的恐惧，如果他询问她就会让奥黛特生气，让自己变得可憎，现在已经不复存在了。他已经失去了被她爱的所有希望。

One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d’Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d’Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d’Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort, answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d’Orsan was not lacking in that either, and his relations with Swann—cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found in talking together—were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d’Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was in thoroughly ‘detrimental’ society. ‘It is not for nothing,’ he now assured himself, ‘that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour. He may have acted dishonourably once again.’ Then he suspected Rémi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann’s good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths—which no strange eye might explore—of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist’s rather than the business-man’s, the noble’s rather than the flunkey’s. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge one’s fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals—would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail—insignificant but true—which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played, the sight of the title—Les Filles de Marbre, by Théodore Barrière,—struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word ‘marble,’ which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at the Palais d’Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, ‘Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You’re not made of marble.’ Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words, Filles de Marbre, and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he recoiled again in horror.
有一天，他收到一封匿名信，信中告诉他，奥黛特曾是无数男人（其中几个人的名字，其中包括福什维尔、德·布雷奥特先生和画家）和女人的情妇，而且她经常光顾名声不佳的房子。 。他发现自己的朋友中有一个人能够给他寄出这样一封信（某些细节暴露出作者对他的私生活的熟悉程度），这让他感到很痛苦。他想知道这可能是谁。但对于其他人的未知行为，那些与他们所说的没有明显联系的行为，他从来没有任何怀疑。当他想知道德·夏吕斯先生、德·洛姆先生或多尔桑先生的表面性格是否相当不合时，他必须将这一不光彩的行为可能发生在未曾涉足的地区。出生；因为这些人在与斯万交谈时从未暗示过他赞成匿名信，而且他们对他所说的一切都暗示着他们强烈反对，所以他认为没有更多的理由将这种耻辱与匿名信联系起来。其中任何一个都比其他人多。德·夏吕斯先生有些古怪，但他本质上是善良和善良的。德洛梅先生的性格有点干涩，但健康又正直。至于多尔桑先生，斯旺从来没有遇到过任何一个人，即使在最令人沮丧的情况下，也会向他说出更衷心的话语，采取更恰当的行动，更谨慎地对待他。以至于他无法理解通常被认为是M的相当不雅的部分。 多尔桑与一位富有的女人的关系，每当他想到他时，他就不得不把那个邪恶的名声放在一边，因为与他的真诚和优雅的许多明确的证据是不可调和的。有一瞬间，斯万觉得自己的思绪变得阴云密布，他想到了别的事情，好让自己恢复一点光明。直到他有勇气回到那些其他的思考。但后来，在无法怀疑任何人之后，他被迫怀疑他认识的所有人。毕竟，德·夏吕斯先生可能是最喜欢他的，也可能是最和蔼可亲的。但他是个神经病患者；明天，也许他会在听到斯万病了的消息后放声大哭。今天，出于嫉妒，或者出于愤怒，或者出于某种突然的想法，他可能想故意伤害他。确实，这样的男人是最糟糕的。当然，德·洛姆亲王对斯万的忠诚度远不如德·夏吕斯先生。但正因为如此，他对他没有同样的敏感度。此外，他的本性虽然毫无疑问是冷酷的，但既不能做卑鄙的事，也不能做出宽宏大量的行为。斯万遗憾的是，除了这些人之外，他一生中没有产生任何依恋。然后他反思，阻止人们伤害邻居的是同情心，归根结底，他只能为那些本性与他相似的人负责，就像过去一样，只要心存善念。 ，德·夏吕斯先生的。光是想到会给斯万带来如此大的痛苦，他就会感到厌恶。 但是，对于一个麻木不仁、属于另一种人类秩序的人来说，就像德·洛姆亲王一样，人们如何预见他可能会因另一种本性的促使而采取的行动呢？拥有一颗善良的心就是一切，而德·夏吕斯先生就有一颗善良的心。但多尔桑先生也不乏这一点，他与斯旺的关系——诚挚，但谈不上亲密，因为他们对一切都持有相同的看法，他们在一起交谈时发现了快乐——比斯万更平静。德·夏吕斯先生的热情，他很容易被引导到热情的活动中，无论善行还是恶行。如果斯万觉得有谁一直理解他，并且（小心翼翼地）爱着他，那么这个人就是多尔桑先生。是的，但是他的生活；这很难说是光荣的。斯万遗憾的是，他从未注意到这些谣言，他本人也开玩笑地承认，他从未像在完全“有害”的社会中那样感受到如此强烈的同情或尊重。他现在向自己保证，“当人们对邻居做出判断时，他们的结论是基于他的行为，这并非没有道理。”只有那些才是重要的，而不是我们所说的或我们所想的。夏吕斯和德洛姆可能有这样或那样的缺点，但他们都是有荣誉的人。奥桑或许没有同样的缺点，但他并不是一个有荣誉感的人。他可能又做了一次不光彩的事。”然后他怀疑雷米，确实，这封信的灵感只能是雷米，但他现在感觉自己走在正确的道路上。首先，洛雷丹希望伤害奥黛特有他自己的理由。 那么，我们怎能不认为，我们的仆人生活在比我们低劣的境地，给我们的财富和弱点增添了想象中的财富和罪恶，他们立即羡慕和鄙视我们，不应该发现自己被命运会做出让我们这个阶级的人所厌恶的事情吗？他还怀疑我的祖父。每当斯旺请求他为他提供任何服务时，他不是总是拒绝吗？此外，以他中产阶级的尊严观念，他可能会认为自己是为了斯旺的利益而行动。反过来，他又怀疑画家贝戈特、维尔迪兰夫妇。停顿片刻，再次欣赏社会人士的智慧，他们拒绝混入艺术圈子，而在艺术圈子里，这种事情是可能的，甚至可能被公开宣称为绝妙的笑话；但随后他回忆起那些波西米亚人身上所观察到的诚实的标志，并将它们与权宜之计的生活进行了对比，这种生活往往近乎欺诈，因为缺钱，对奢侈的渴望，以及享乐的腐败影响，使他们常常陷入欺诈的境地。驱使贵族成员。总而言之，这封匿名信证明了他本人认识一个能够做出最臭名昭著的行为的人，但他看不出为什么这种臭名昭著的行为应该潜伏在温暖的内心深处——任何外人都无法探索到这一点——而不是隐藏在温暖的内心深处。寒冷，是艺术家的而不是商人的，是贵族的而不是奴才的。一个人应该采用什么标准来评判自己的同胞？毕竟，在他认识的人中，没有一个人在某些情况下不会做出可耻的行为。那么他必须不再看到他们所有人吗？ 他的思绪变得阴云密布。他用手在额头上擦了两三下，用手帕擦了擦眼镜，想起毕竟像他一样优秀的人经常与德·夏吕斯先生、德·洛姆亲王和其他人交往，他说服自己，这即使不是意味着他们没有能力做出可耻的行为，至少也意味着，经常与那些也许并非没有能力做出这种行为的人交往，是人类生活的必然，每个人都必须服从这一点。 。他继续与所有他怀疑的朋友握手，他们每个人都表现出纯粹正式的保留态度，可能是为了让他绝望。至于信的具体内容，他们并没有打扰他；因为在它对奥黛特提出的所有指控中，他看不到任何事实的痕迹。和许多其他人一样，斯旺生性懒惰，发明迟缓。他很清楚，作为一个普遍真理，人类的生活充满了对比，但对于任何一个人来说，他想象中他或她生活中他或她不熟悉的部分与他或她生活中的部分是相同的。他是。他根据所揭露的内容想象着对他保密的事情。当他和奥黛特一起度过的时候，如果他们的谈话转向了某个不雅行为，或者某个第三者表达的不雅情绪，她会凭借斯旺经常听到的道德原则无情地谴责肇事者。他自己的父母，他自己也一直忠于他们。然后，她会插花，喝茶，表现出对他工作的兴趣。 于是斯旺将这些习惯延续到了她的余生中，当他希望描绘出他和她分开的时刻时，他重构了这些行为。如果有人向他描绘她本来的样子，或者更确切地说，按照她长期以来对自己的描绘，但用另一个男人代替，他会感到痛苦，因为这样的肖像会让他觉得栩栩如生。但是，假设她去了糟糕的房子，她与其他女人纵情狂欢，她过着最卑贱、最可鄙的凡人的悲惨生活——这将是一种疯狂的思想漫游，因为她意识到感谢老天爷，他能想象到的菊花，每天的一杯茶，以及高尚的愤慨，都不曾离开时间和地点。只是，他时不时地让奥黛特明白，人们恶意地让他知道她所做的一切；并适时地利用了他偶然了解到的一些细节——微不足道但却真实的细节，就好像这是他在完整重建的无数其他片段中不由自主地允许通过他的嘴唇的唯一片段。他把她的日常生活秘密记在心里，让她以为他对事情了如指掌，而事实上，他既不知道也不怀疑，因为如果他经常嘱咐奥黛特永远不要偏离或改变事实上，无论他是否意识到，那只是为了让奥黛特告诉他她所做的一切。毫无疑问，正如他过去向奥黛特保证的那样，他喜欢真诚，但前提是他可能会喜欢一个能让他与情妇的日常生活保持联系的迎合者。而且，他的爱诚而不是无私，并没有改善他的性格。 他所珍视的真相是奥杰特会告诉他的。但他本人，为了从她那里得到这个真相，并不害怕诉诸谎言，他从未停止向奥黛特描绘这种谎言，这种谎言导致每个人类都陷入彻底的堕落。总而言之，他和奥黛特一样撒谎，因为虽然他比她更不快乐，但他的自私心却丝毫不减。而她，当她听到他向她重复她所做的事情时，她会用一种不信任的眼神，甚至冒着危险，用一种愤慨的眼神盯着他，以免显得受到羞辱，并因自己的行为而脸红。她的行为。有一天，在经历了迄今为止最长的平静期之后，他接受了邀请，与德洛姆公主一起在剧院度过了一个晚上。打开报纸想知道正在播放的节目时，看到标题——西奥多·巴里埃的《Marbre Filles de Marbre》——给了他如此残酷的打击，以至于他本能地退缩并转过头去。仿佛被一排脚灯照亮，在它现在出现的新环境中，“大理石”这个词，他已经失去了辨别的能力，它经常在他的眼睛下面以印刷品的形式经过，突然间再次出现，他立刻想起了奥黛特很久以前告诉他的故事，她和夫人一起参观了工业宫的沙龙。维尔迪兰对她说：“现在小心点！”我知道如何融化你，好吧。你不是大理石做的。”奥黛特向他保证这只是个玩笑，而他当时并没有太在意这件事。但那时他对她比现在更有信心。 这封匿名信明确提到了此类关系。他不敢抬头看报纸，就把它打开，翻了一页，以免再看到“马布尔姑娘”几个字，然后开始机械地阅读各省的新闻。英吉利海峡遭遇了暴风雨，迪耶普、卡布尔、伯泽瓦尔等地都收到了损坏的报告……突然，他又惊恐地后退了一步。

The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette’s lover. After all, when it came to M. de Bréauté, there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their own innocence), who—as, for instance, Odette,—would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years before: ‘Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won’t hear of anything just now but me. I’m a ‘love,’ if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name.’ So far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin’s warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love expire. Suddenly he made up his mind.
伯泽瓦尔（Beuzeval）的名字让他想起了同一地区的另一个地方，伯泽维尔（Beuzeville），这个地方还带有一个用连字符连接起来的第二个名字，即布雷奥特（Bréauté），他经常在地图上看到这个名字，但以前从未见过。并指出这与他的朋友德·布雷奥特先生的名字相同，匿名信指控他是奥黛特的情人。毕竟，当涉及到德·布雷奥特先生时，指控并没有什么不可能的。但就Mme而言。维尔迪兰担心，这根本不可能。从奥黛特偶尔会撒谎的事实来看，我们不能公平地得出结论说她从来没有说过实话，而且在与夫人的这些戏谑的谈话中。维尔迪兰（她自己向斯万重复过），他能认出那些毫无意义和危险的寒暄，这是妇女们由于缺乏生活经验和对罪恶的无知而经常说出的（从而证明自己的清白），她们——例如奥黛特——将是世界上最后一批对彼此产生不正当感情的人。另一方面，她用她的故事驱散了她无意间在他心中产生的怀疑，这种愤慨与他所知道的他的品味和气质相吻合。情妇。但在那一刻，通过嫉妒的灵感，类似于向诗人或哲学家揭示的灵感，到目前为止，他们除了一对奇怪的韵律或超然的观察之外一无所有，这个想法或自然法则将斯万第一次回忆起至少两年前奥黛特对他说过的一句话：“噢，夫人。”维尔迪兰，除了我，她现在什么也听不到。 如果你愿意的话，我是一个“爱人”，她吻了我，并希望我无论到哪里都和她一起去，并用她的教名称呼她。为了营造一种罪恶的气氛，奥黛特后来向他重复了这一点，他欢迎他们作为夫人的证据。维尔迪兰的热情和慷慨的友谊。但现在，她对奥黛特的感情的旧记忆突然与他最近对她不体面谈话的记忆结合在一起。他在心里再也无法将它们分开，他看到它们在现实中融为一体，这种感情赋予了这些寒暄以某种严肃性和重要性，而反过来又破坏了其纯真的感情。他去看奥黛特。他坐下来，与她保持着一定的距离。他不敢拥抱她，不知道一个吻会激起她，还是他自己，会激起爱意还是愤怒。他静静地坐在那里，看着他们的爱情消失。突然他下定了决心。

‘Odette, my darling,’ he began, ‘I know, I am being simply odious, but I must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?’
“奥黛特，我亲爱的，”他开始说道，“我知道，我实在是太可恶了，但我必须问你几个问题。你还记得我曾经对你和夫人的看法。维尔迪兰？告诉我，这是真的吗？你和她或其他人有过吗？

She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore them to go, when some one has asked, ‘Are you coming to watch the procession go by?’, or ‘Will you be at the review?’. But this shake of the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite possibly true.
她抿起嘴唇，摇摇头。人们通常用这个标志来表示他们不会去，因为当有人问“你要来看游行队伍经过吗？”或“你会参加检阅吗？”时，他们会感到无聊。 '。但是，这种摇头通常用于拒绝参与尚未发生的事件，因此给拒绝参与过去的事件带来了不确定性。此外，它提出了个人便利的原因，而不是任何明确的否认或任何道德上的不可能性。当他看到奥黛特如此向他暗示这个暗示是假的时，他意识到这很可能是真的。

‘I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,’ she added, seeming angry and uncomfortable.
“我已经告诉过你了，我从来没有这样做过；你很清楚。”她补充道，看上去既生气又不自在。

‘Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don’t say to me, ‘You know quite well’; say, ‘I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.’’
“是的，我知道这一切；但你确定吗？不要对我说：“你很清楚”；说，“我从来没有对任何女人做过这样的事情。”

She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: ‘I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.’
她像死记硬背一样重复着他的话，仿佛她希望借此摆脱他：“我从来没有对任何女人做过这样的事。”

‘Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?’
“你能在你的拉格托奖章上向我发誓吗？”

Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that.
斯旺知道奥黛特绝不会因此而作伪证。

‘Oh, you do make me so miserable,’ she cried, with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. ‘Have you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!’
“哦，你确实让我很痛苦，”她叫道，身体猛地一抖，仿佛要挣脱他问题的束缚。 ‘你快完成了吗？你今天怎么了？你似乎已经下定决心，要让我被迫恨你、诅咒你！看，我很想再次和你成为朋友，希望我们能像以前一样一起度过愉快的时光；这就是我得到的所有感谢！

However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it.
然而，他不肯放开她，而是坐在那里，就像一位外科医生，等待着中断手术的痉挛消退，但并不需要让他放弃手术。

‘You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in the world, Odette,’ he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness. ‘I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a great deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger with you is never due to your actions—I can and do forgive you everything because I love you—but to your untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done those things.’
“你以为我对你的恶意是世界上最小的，你就大错特错了，奥黛特，”他以一种有说服力的、欺骗性的温柔开始说道。 “除了我已经知道的事情之外，我从来不跟你说话，而且我知道的总是比我说的多得多。但只有你能通过你的坦白来平息我对你的仇恨，只要这件事只是由其他人向我报告的。我对你的愤怒从来不是因为你的行为——我可以而且确实原谅你的一切，因为我爱你——而是因为你的不诚实，这种可笑的不诚实让你坚持否认我知道是真实的事情。当我看到你坚持，当我听到你向我发誓我知道是假的事情时，你怎么能指望我会继续爱你呢？奥黛特，不要再延长这折磨我们俩的时刻了。如果你愿意立即结束它，你将永远摆脱它。告诉我，在你的奖章上，是或否，你是否曾经做过这些事情。

‘How on earth can I tell?’ she was furious. ‘Perhaps I have, ever so long ago, when I didn’t know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.’
“我到底怎么知道？”她很愤怒。 “也许很久以前，当我不知道自己在做什么的时候，我就这么做过，也许有两三次。”

Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in one’s body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead, since those words ‘two or three times’ carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that those words, ‘two or three times,’ nothing more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man’s heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s: ‘I have never seen anything to beat it since the table-turning.’ The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words ‘perhaps two or three times,’ was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done ‘two or three times’ might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins’) to desire the possession—as if that were ever possible—of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann’s strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much—as it ordinarily was—in Swann’s brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann’s heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La Pérouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette’s alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe.
斯旺已经做好了应对所有可能性的准备。因此，现实一定是与可能性无关的东西，就像刀刺在人身上与头顶上的云层的逐渐移动无关一样，因为“两三次”这几个字是刻在上面的，他心脏的活组织上有一个十字架。确实奇怪的是，“两三遍”这几个字，只不过是几个字，隔着一段距离在空中说出来的话，就能如此撕裂一个人的心，仿佛它们真的刺穿了它一样，可以使人生病，就像喝下毒药一样。斯万本能地想起了他在夫人那里听到的那句话。 de Saint-Euverte 说：“自从事情发生逆转以来，我从未见过任何东西可以打败它。”他现在所遭受的痛苦与他想象的完全不同。不仅因为，在他最完全不信任她的时候，他很少想象到如此邪恶的顶峰，而且因为，即使他确实想象了这种冒犯，它仍然是模糊的，不确定的，并没有被包裹在特殊的恐怖之中。他用“也许两三次”这句话逃脱了，并没有那种特殊的残忍，这与他所知道的一种新疾病不同，第一次受到这种疾病的攻击。然而，这位奥黛特，所有这一切邪恶的源头，对他来说都同样珍贵，相反，更加珍贵，仿佛随着他的痛苦增加，镇静剂的价格也随之增加，这个女人独自拥有的解药。他希望给予她更多的关注，就像人们关注一种突然发现变得更加严重的疾病一样。 他希望她告诉他的那件她已经做过“两三次”的可怕事情可以避免再次发生。为了确保这一点，他必须监视奥黛特。人们常说，向一个男人指出情妇的缺点，只会加深他对她的依恋，因为他不相信你；但如果他这样做了，那就更是如此了！但是，斯旺问自己，他怎样才能保护她呢？他也许能够保护她免受任何一个女人的污染，但还有数百个其他女人；当他开始渴望占有另一个人时（那天晚上他在维尔迪兰家没能找到奥黛特），他意识到自己的野心是多么疯狂。对斯旺来说，幸运的是，在像一群征服的野蛮人一样侵入他的灵魂的巨大痛苦之下，有一个自然的基础，更古老，更平静，默默地努力，就像受伤器官的细胞一样，它们立即开始工作，以恢复生命。修复受损的组织或瘫痪肢体的肌肉，使其恢复以前的运动能力。这些年长的、这些在他灵魂中的本土居民在一段时间内吸收了斯万的全部力量，在那个模糊的修复任务中，这给一个人在康复期间或手术后带来一种虚幻的休息感。这次，由于精疲力尽而产生的紧张感不再像平常那样在斯万的大脑中发挥作用，而是在他的心里发挥作用。 但生活中曾经存在过的所有事情都会重演，就像一只垂死的动物再次被痉挛的阵痛所搅动，而这场痉挛显然在斯万的心上结束了，只幸存了片刻，同样的痛苦又自动回来了，再次追踪同一个十字架。他还记得那些月光灿烂的夜晚，当他靠在维多利亚大道上，驶向拉佩鲁斯街时，他会以一种纵欲的享受来培养一个恋爱中的男人的情感，却不知道这种情感必然会结出有毒的果实。但所有这些想法只持续了不到一秒钟，他才把手举到心口，再次吸一口气，努力微笑，以掩饰自己的痛苦。他已经开始提出进一步的问题了。他的嫉妒心费了一番周折，这是任何敌人都不会招致的，才给了他致命的一击，让他被迫经历了他所经历过的最残酷的痛苦，他的嫉妒心并没有满足于他的嫉妒心。他受的苦还不够多，他还试图让自己的胸口受到更深的伤害。他的嫉妒就像一个邪恶的神灵一样激励着斯旺，将他推向毁灭。这不是他的错，而是奥黛特的错，如果他一开始受到的惩罚不是更严厉的话。

‘My darling,’ he began again, ‘it’s all over now; was it with anyone I know?’
“亲爱的，”他又开始说道，“现在一切都结束了；是和我认识的人一起做的吗？

‘No, I swear it wasn’t; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really went as far as that.’
“不，我发誓不是；”此外，我认为我夸大了，我从来没有真正做到这一点。

He smiled, and resumed with: ‘Just as you like. It doesn’t really matter, but it’s unfortunate that you can’t give me any name. If I were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn’t bother you any more about it. It’s so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things ir one’s mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine. But you’ve been so sweet to me; I don’t want to tire you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I’ve quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?’
他微笑着，继续说道：“随你便。”这并不重要，但不幸的是你不能给我任何名字。如果我能够对这个人形成一个想法，我就不会再想起她了。我这么说是为了你好，因为那样我就不应该再打扰你了。能够对自己脑海中的事物形成清晰的认识真是令人欣慰。真正可怕的是人们无法想象的。但你对我却如此甜蜜；我不想让你累。我衷心感谢您为我所做的一切。我现在已经完成了。只剩下一个字了：多少次？

‘Oh, Charles! can’t you see, you’re killing me? It’s all ever so long ago. I’ve never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you’d be a lot better off!’ she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice.
哦，查尔斯！你没看到吗，你在杀我吗？这一切都是很久以前的事了。我从来没有想过。任何人都会说你正在积极尝试再次将这些想法放入我的脑海中。然后你的境况就会好得多！”她总结道，语气中带着无意识的愚蠢，但却带着蓄意的恶意。

‘I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It’s only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can’t give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it’s not possible that you don’t remember with whom, Odette, my love.’
“我只是想知道是不是自从我认识你以来就这样了。这很自然。它曾经在这里发生过吗？你不能给我一个特别的夜晚，让我提醒自己当时在做什么吗？你当然明白，你不可能不记得和谁在一起，奥黛特，我的爱人。

‘But I don’t know; really, I don’t. I think it was in the Bois, one evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with the Princesse des Laumes,’ she added, happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. ‘At the next table there was a woman whom I hadn’t seen for ever so long. She said to me, ‘Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the water!’ At first I just yawned, and said, ‘No, I’m too tired, and I’m quite happy where I am, thank you.’ She swore there’d never been anything like it in the way of moonlight. ‘I’ve heard that tale before,’ I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.’ Odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight of Swann’s face, she changed her tone, and:
“但我不知道；真的，我不知道。我想那是在布瓦，一天晚上你来岛上接我们的时候。你一直在和洛姆斯公主一起吃饭，”她补充道，很高兴能够向他提供确切的细节，这证明了她的真实性。 “邻桌有一位女士，我已经很久没见到她了。她对我说：“到那儿的岩石后面来，看看水面上的月光！”起初我只是打了个哈欠，然后说：“不，我太累了，而且我很高兴在那里是的，谢谢你。”她发誓，月光下从来没有出现过这样的情况。 “我以前听过这个故事，”我对她说。你看，我很清楚她在追求什么。”奥黛特几乎把这件事当作一个笑话来讲述，要么是因为她觉得这很自然，要么是因为她认为自己因此淡化了它的重要性，或者不然以免显得羞耻。但是，看到斯旺的脸，她改变了语气：

‘You are a fiend!’ she flung at him, ‘you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you’ll leave me in peace.’
“你真是个恶魔！”她猛地扑向他，“你喜欢折磨我，让我对你说谎，这样你就可以让我安静下来。”

This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered, which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the ‘rock there,’... He could hear her answer—alas, how lightheartedly—‘I’ve heard that tale before!’ He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time, then said to her:
对斯旺的第二次打击比第一次更加难以忍受。他从来没有想过这件事是最近发生的事情，隐藏在他天真无邪的眼睛之外，不是在他从未知道的过去，而是在他记忆深刻、他经历过的夜晚。他本以为自己对奥黛特有着如此深入、如此详尽的了解，但现在回想起来，却呈现出狡猾、欺骗和残忍的一面。他们中间突然分开了一道巨大的鸿沟，那一刻是在布洛涅森林岛上的那一刻。奥黛特虽然不聪明，但却有一种自然的魅力。她回忆道，她把这个小场景表演得如此简单，以至于斯万在气喘吁吁时都能清楚地看到它：奥黛特打着哈欠，“那块石头”……他能听到她的回答——唉，多么轻松愉快。 ——“我以前听过这个故事！”他觉得那天晚上她不会告诉他更多的事情，目前预计不会有进一步的透露。他沉默了一会儿，对她说道：

‘My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you dreadfully, but it’s all over now; I shall never think of it again.’
“我可怜的亲爱的，你必须原谅我；我知道，我深深地伤害了你，但现在一切都结束了；我再也不会想起它了。

But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting—of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it—that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: ‘Life is indeed astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have suspected.’ But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: ‘I knew quite well what she was after.’ ‘Two or three times.’ ‘I’ve heard that tale before.’ But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: ‘I’m quite happy where I am, thank you,’ ‘I’ve heard that tale before,’ but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile: ‘You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!’ By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny’s Journal d’un Poète which he had previously read without emotion: ‘When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, ‘What are ‘her surroundings? What has been her life?’ All one’s future happiness lies in the answer.’ Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, ‘I’ve heard that tale before,’ or ‘I knew quite well what she was after,’ could cause him so much pain. But he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,—indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence—whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be effectively wounded by Odette’s admission, in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette’s sentences had to make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exausted, lo and behold another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette’s life which had elapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed, would make it break out again in another form.
但她看到他的目光仍然停留在他不知道的事情上，停留在他们过去的爱情时代，在他的记忆中单调而舒缓，因为它是模糊的，现在像剑伤一样被撕裂。月光下，他在布瓦岛上与洛姆公主一起用餐的那一刻的新闻。但到目前为止，他已经养成了发现生活有趣的习惯——对生活中将要做出的奇怪发现感到惊叹——即使在他遭受如此剧烈的痛苦时，他也不相信能够忍受这种痛苦多久有时，他对自己说：“生活确实令人惊奇，并有一些美好的惊喜；”看来恶行比人们想象的要普遍得多。这是一个我绝对信任的女人，她看起来如此简单，如此诚实，无论如何，即使她的道德不严格，她的品味和倾向似乎也很正常和健康。我收到了一项最不可能的指控，我质问了她，而她所承认的那一点点所揭示的内容远远超出了我的怀疑。”但他不能仅限于这些超然的观察。他试图对她刚才告诉他的话的重要性做出准确的估计，以便知道他是否可以得出结论，她经常做这些事情，并且很可能会再做一次。他对自己重复着她的话：“我很清楚她在追求什么。”“两三次了。”“我以前听过那个故事。”但他们并没有赤手空拳地出现在他的记忆中；他们没有带武器。他们每个人都拿着一把刀，又用刀刺伤了他。 很长一段时间，他就像一个病人，每一分钟都无法克制自己尝试做出他知道会伤害他的动作，他不断地对自己低声说：“我很高兴我现在在这儿，谢谢。”你，”“我以前听过这个故事，”但疼痛如此强烈，他不得不停下来。他惊讶地发现，迄今为止他一直轻视的行为，事实上，一笑置之，对他来说竟然变得像一种很容易致命的疾病一样严重。他认识很多女人，他可以要求她们监视奥黛特，但他怎么能指望她们适应他的新观点，而不是停留在长期以来属于他自己的观点上呢？一直引导着他的放荡生活；不要笑着对他说：“你这个嫉妒的怪物，想夺走别人的快乐！”他（在过去从未发现过对他的爱）是通过什么活板门突然降下的？奥黛特（除了最精致的快乐之外）被扔进了这个新的地狱圈，他不知道如何才能逃脱。可怜的奥黛特！他希望她不要受到伤害。她只能承担一半的责任。难道他没有被告知，是她自己的母亲在她还是个孩子的时候就把她卖给了尼斯的一个富有的英国人吗？但现在，阿尔弗莱德·德·维尼的《诗人杂志》中的几行诗句中包含了一个多么令人痛苦的真理，他以前毫无感情地读过这本书：“当一个人感到自己被对一个女人的爱所迷住时，应该对自己说，”她的周围环境如何？她的一生是怎样的？”一个人未来的幸福就在于这个答案。’斯万很惊讶，这样简单的短语，在他的脑海中拼写出来，比如“我以前听过那个故事”，或者“我很清楚她在追求什么”，竟然会给他带来如此多的痛苦。但他意识到，他误认为简单短语的东西确实是整套服装的一部分，这些服装可能会给他带来奥黛特讲述她的故事时所感受到的痛苦。因为他现在再次感受到同样的痛苦。现在他知道了，那是没有用的——事实上，随着时间的推移，这也没有用，他已经部分忘记并完全原谅了这次冒犯——每当他重复她的话时，他旧日的痛苦就会重塑他，就像奥黛特开始说话之前一样。说话：无知、信任；他无情的嫉妒再次将他置于一个还不知道真相的人的境地，这样他就可能因奥黛特的承认而受到有效的伤害。几个月后，这个老故事仍然让他目瞪口呆，就像突然的启示一样。他惊叹于自己记忆力惊人的创造力。只有随着年龄的增长，生育力逐渐减弱，他才有望减轻痛苦。但是，当奥黛特的任何一句话使斯旺受苦的力量似乎几乎耗尽时，你瞧，另一句话，他迄今为止最不注意的句子之一，几乎是一个新句子，来缓解首先，以不减的力量攻击他。那天晚上他与洛梅斯公主共进晚餐的记忆让他感到痛苦，但这只不过是他痛苦的中心、核心。那光在它周围隐隐约约地散发着，弥漫到了前后的所有日子里。 不管他想把记忆停留在哪一点上，那是整个季节，韦尔迪兰夫妇经常去布瓦岛上吃饭，这一切都回来伤害了他。如此猛烈地，以至于他的嫉妒心一直在他心中激发的好奇心慢慢地被他对新的折磨的恐惧所抵消，如果他满足了这种好奇心，他就会给自己带来新的折磨。他认识到，在奥黛特第一次遇见他之前，她一生中所经历的所有时期，他从未试图在脑海中形成任何画面的时期，并不是他隐约看到的毫无特色的抽象概念，而是由如此多的东西组成的。许多明确的、过时的年份，每一年都充满了具体的事件。但如果他想了解更多，他担心她的过去现在已经毫无色彩、流动且可以支撑，可能会呈现出一种有形的、淫秽的形式，具有个性化和恶魔般的特征。他继续克制着不寻求它的概念，现在不再是因为思想懒惰，而是因为害怕受苦。他希望有一天，他能够听到布瓦岛的岛屿，或者提及洛姆斯公主，而不会感到任何旧日撕裂般的痛苦的刺痛；与此同时，他认为激怒奥黛特向他提供新的句子、更多的地点、人物和不同事件的名称是不明智的，因为当他的疾病尚未痊愈时，这会让他以另一种形式再次爆发。

But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain bow far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette’s mind, with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying—without hurting Odette—to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden—a dead weight, but none the less disturbing—of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever.
但是，很多时候，他不知道的事情，他现在害怕知道的事情，都是奥黛特自己自发地、不考虑自己做了什么，向他透露的；而他自己也知道，这些事情是奥黛特自己做的。因为她的恶习在她的现实生活和斯万曾经相信并且常常仍然相信他的情妇所过的相对纯真的生活之间造成的差距比她想象的要大得多。一个恶毒的人总是在人们面前表现出同样的美德，他急于不让人们对他的恶行产生任何怀疑，但他没有记录，没有手头的标准来确定这些恶行的远近（它们的持续增长是难以察觉的）他自己）逐渐使他脱离了正常的生活方式。在他们同居的过程中，奥黛特的脑海里，随着她对斯旺这个另一个人隐瞒的那些行为的记忆，她那些无伤大雅的行为逐渐被这些行为染上了色彩，受到了感染，而她却无法察觉其中有什么奇怪的地方，它们并没有在她让它们生活的特定区域引起任何爆炸，但当她把它们告诉斯旺时，斯旺被它们所指向的口是心非的揭露所震惊。有一天，他试图在不伤害奥黛特的情况下，从她那里打探出她是否曾经与妓女有过交往。事实上，他确信她没有。那封匿名信让他产生了这个想法，但只是以一种纯粹机械的方式。它被毫无轻信地收到了，但尽管如此，它仍然留在那里，斯万希望摆脱这种怀疑的负担——沉重的负担，但仍然令人不安，希望奥黛特现在能永远消灭它。

‘Oh dear, no! Not that they don’t simply persecute me to go to them,’ her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. ‘There was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any money I asked. It seems, there’s an Ambassador who said to her, ‘I’ll kill myself if you don’t bring her to me’—meaning me! They told her I’d gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and speak to her, before she’d go away. I do wish you could have seen the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I shouted fit to bring the house down:—‘But when you hear me say that I don’t want to! The idea of such a thing, I don’t like it at all! I should hope I’m still free to do as I please and when I please and where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...’ The porter has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I was talking to her. I know, you’d have been pleased, my dear. There’s some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say such dreadful things about her.’
‘噢，亲爱的，不！并不是说他们不只是逼迫我去见他们，”她的微笑透露出一种满足的虚荣心，她不再认为这对斯旺来说是不可能的。 “昨天，其中一个人等了我两个多小时，说只要我要钱，她都会给我。”好像有一位大使对她说：“如果你不带她来见我，我就会自杀”——指的是我！他们告诉她我出去了，但她等了又等，最后我不得不在她离开之前亲自去和她说话。我真希望你能看到我对付她的方式；我的女仆在隔壁房间里听着，并告诉我，我大声喊叫可以把房子推倒：“但是当你听到我说我不想这么做时！”这种想法，我一点也不喜欢！我希望我仍然可以自由地做我想做的事，无论何时何地！如果我需要钱，我可以理解……”门房接到命令，不再让她进来；他会告诉她我出城了。哦，我真希望在我和她说话的时候能把你藏在房间里的某个地方。我知道，你会很高兴的，亲爱的。你看，你的小奥黛特毕竟还是有一些优点的，尽管人们确实说她很可怕。

Besides, her very admissions—when she made any—of faults which she supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like corpses in a river. And they poisoned it.
此外，当她承认自己认为他已经发现的错误时，她的承认反而给斯旺带来了新的怀疑，而不是结束了旧的怀疑。因为她的承认与他的怀疑并不完全一致。奥黛特可能徒劳地删除她的坦白中的所有主要部分，但在附件中仍会留下斯旺从未想象过的东西，这再次压垮了他，并使他能够改变嫉妒问题的条款。这些承认他永远不会忘记。他的灵魂带着他们走，把他们扔到一边，然后又把他们抱在怀里，就像河里的尸体一样。他们给它下了毒。

She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête. ‘What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,’ he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d’Or. She swore that she had not. ‘Still, the Maison d’Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn’t true,’ he pursued, hoping to frighten her. ‘Yes that I hadn’t been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Prévost’s,’ she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. ‘It’s quite true, I hadn’t been to the Maison Dorée. I was coming away from Forcheville’s. I had, really, been to Prévost’s—that wasn’t a story—and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d’Or because I was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don’t you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I’m telling you all about it now, a’n’t I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, if it were true? Especially as at that time we didn’t know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?’
有一次她跟他谈到福什维尔在巴黎穆尔西节日那天拜访过她。 '什么！你这么早就认识他了？哦，是的，你当然知道了，”他纠正自己，以免表明他对这一事实一无所知。突然，他一想到，在巴黎穆尔西节日那天，当他收到那封他精心保存的信时，她可能正在金宫与福什维尔共进午餐。 。她发誓她没有。 “尽管如此，金宫还是让我想起了一些事情，但我当时就知道这不是真的，”他继续说道，希望能吓到她。 “是的，那天晚上我根本不在场，当我告诉你我刚从那里回来时，你一直在普雷沃斯特家找我，”她回答道（从他的态度来看，他知道），语气坚定，与其说她是基于愤世嫉俗，不如说是基于胆怯、害怕得罪斯万（她的自尊心使她急于隐藏这一点）以及渴望向他表明，如果她愿意的话，她可以完全坦白。因此，她用刽子手挥舞斧头的锋利和力量击打了他，但不能被指控残忍，因为她完全没有意识到伤害了他；她甚至开始大笑，虽然这也许，确实，主要是为了让他不认为她感到羞耻或困惑。 “确实如此，我没有去过 Maison Dorée。我正要离开福什维尔家。我确实去过普雷沃斯特的店——这不是故事——他在那里遇见了我，并邀请我进去看看他的版画。但还有人来看他。我告诉你我是从金宫来的，因为我担心你会生我的气。我真是太好了，真的，你明白吗？ 我承认，我做错了，但至少我现在把这一切都告诉你了，不是吗？如果这是真的，我不直接告诉你我在巴黎穆尔西节日那天与他共进午餐对我有什么好处？尤其是那时我们彼此之间还不像现在那么了解，不是吗，亲爱的？’

He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so, even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had ‘done a cattleya’) when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Dorée, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: ‘I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.’ From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: ‘I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn’t ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.’ And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker’s flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Dorée, and, like the obscene creatures in the ‘Desolation of Nineveh,’ shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Dorée it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dorée, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann’s love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann’s heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion.
他对她微笑，脸上突然出现了怯懦的虚弱，就像这些令人心碎的话语让他变成了一个毫无生气的人。所以，即使在他不敢再想的那几个月里，因为他们太幸福了，在她爱他的那几个月里，她已经在骗他了！除了她告诉他她是从多雷庄园来的那一刻（他们“做了卡特兰”的第一个晚上）之外，肯定还有多少其他时刻，每一个都掩盖了斯旺所知道的谎言。没有怀疑。他记得有一次她对他说：“我只需要告诉夫人。”维尔迪兰说我的衣服还没准备好，或者我的出租车迟到了。总有一些借口。”他自己也可能如此，很多时候，当她流利地说出诸如解释延迟或证明更改会议时间的合理性之类的话时，这些时刻一定已经隐藏起来，而他却没有丝毫察觉。当时，她与另一个男人订了婚，她对某个男人说：“我只需告诉斯旺，我的衣服还没准备好，或者我的出租车来晚了。”总有一些借口。”在他所有最愉快的回忆之下，在奥黛特过去对他说过的最简单的话语之下，在他相信这些话就像福音书中的话语之下，在她向他讲述的她的日常行为之下，在最普通的地方，她的裁缝公寓，布瓦大道，竞技场，他能感觉到（隐藏在那里，由于时间的多余，在最详细地描述了一天是如何度过的之后，总是留下一些东西（那里可能是某些未承认的行为的藏身之处），他能感觉到一种可能的谎言暗流的暗示，这种谎言贬低了他最珍贵的一切，他最快乐的夜晚，拉佩鲁斯街本身，奥黛特必须总是在她告诉他的时间之外的其他时间离开；当他听到她承认有关多雷之家的事情时，笼罩着他的黑暗恐怖的力量进一步扩大，就像《尼尼微的荒凉》中的淫秽生物一样，一块一块地粉碎着他过去的整个大厦。 ……如果现在，每当他的记忆重复着金屋之家残酷的名字时，他就转过身去，那是因为这个名字让他想起了，不再像不久前那样，想起了多雷夫人的名字。德·圣埃弗特的一行人，这是他早已失去的好运，但现在他第一次意识到了不幸。然后，多雷之家的名字就落到了他的头上，就像布瓦岛上的岛屿一样，渐渐地，它的名字不再困扰他了。因为我们所认为的爱和嫉妒都不是单一的、持续的和个人的激情。 它们由无数连续的爱和不同的嫉妒组成，每一种都是短暂的，尽管它们不间断的众多给我们留下了连续性的印象，统一的幻觉。斯万的爱情的生命，他的嫉妒的忠诚，是由死亡、不忠、无数的欲望、无数的怀疑构成的，所有这些都以奥黛特为对象。如果他留了很长一段时间都没有见到她，那些死去的人就不会被其他人取代。但奥黛特的存在继续在斯旺的心中播下爱与猜疑交替的种子。

On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must instantly accompany her home, to ‘do a cattleya,’ and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase, with ‘I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!’ And he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses.
在某些晚上，她会突然恢复对他的善意，并严厉警告他，他必须立即利用这种善意，否则将受到惩罚，在未来的几年里都不会再看到这种善意。他必须立即陪她回家，去“做一场卡特兰”，而她假装对他的渴望是如此突然，如此莫名其妙，如此专横，她对他的吻是如此外露，如此陌生，以至于这个残酷和不自然的喜爱使斯万像任何谎言或不友善的行为一样不高兴。一天晚上，当他听从她的命令，和她一起回家时，当她用热情的话语来点缀她的亲吻时，与她惯常的冷漠形成了奇怪的对比，他突然觉得自己听到了一种声音；他起身，到处寻找，没有发现任何人，却没有勇气回到她身边。于是，她勃然大怒，打碎了一个花瓶，说道：“我永远无法对你做任何事，你这个不可能的人！”他不确定她是否真的在房间里藏了某个男人，而她嫉妒了这个男人。想要伤害他，或者激怒他的感官。

Sometimes he repaired to ‘gay’ houses, hoping to learn something about Odette, although he dared not mention her name. ‘I have a little thing here, you’re sure to like,’ the ‘manageress’ would greet him, and he would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young and attractive, said to him once, ‘Of course, what I should like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go with any other men again.’ ‘Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man’s being in love with her, and never to be unfaithful to him?’ asked Swann anxiously. ‘Why, surely! It all depends on their characters!’ Swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a smile: ‘But how nice of you, you’ve put on blue eyes, to go with your sash.’ ‘And you too, you’ve got blue cuffs on.’ ‘What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I’m not boring you, am I; or keeping you?’ ‘No, I’ve nothing to do, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk.’ ‘I am highly flattered.... Aren’t we behaving prettily?’ he asked the ‘manageress,’ who had just looked in. ‘Why, yes, that’s just what I was saying to myself, how sensibly they’re behaving! But that’s how it is! People come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other day, that he’s far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal, I call it. But I’ll leave you in peace now, I know when I’m not wanted,’ she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to interest him. She did not know Odette.
有时他会去“同性恋”的房子，希望了解一些关于奥黛特的信息，尽管他不敢提及她的名字。 “我这里有一件小东西，你一定会喜欢的，”“女经理”会向他打招呼，然后他会呆上一个小时左右，悲伤地和一个可怜的女孩说话，她坐在那里，惊讶于他没有再走下去。其中一个还很年轻、很有魅力的人有一次对他说：“当然，我想要的是找到一个真正的朋友，然后他可能会很确定，我永远不会再和任何其他男人在一起了。” ” “确实，你认为一个女人真的有可能因为一个男人对她的爱而感动，而永远不会对他不忠吗？”斯万焦急地问。 ‘为什么，当然！这完全取决于她们的性格！”斯万忍不住对这些女孩说了同样会让洛姆公主高兴的评论。他微笑着对那个正在寻找朋友的人说：“你真是太好了，你戴上了蓝色的眼睛，和你的腰带相配。”“你也是，你有蓝色的袖口。” “在这样的地方，我们的谈话多么迷人啊！我并没有让你厌烦，不是吗？ “不，我没什么可做的，谢谢。”如果你让我感到无聊，我应该这么说。 “我很受宠若惊……我们表现得不是很好吗？”他问刚刚进来的“女经理”。“为什么，是的，我就是这么说的。”我自己，他们的行为多么明智啊！但就是这样！现在人们来到我家只是为了聊天。就在前几天，王子告诉我，他在这里比和他的妻子在一起舒服得多。看来现在的上流社会名媛都是这样；我称之为完美丑闻。 但现在我会让你安静地离开，我知道什么时候我不被需要。”她谨慎地结束了，然后把斯旺留给了蓝眼睛的女孩。但不久他就起身向她道别。他对她不再感兴趣了。她不认识奥黛特。

The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several of the ‘faithful’ spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the ‘faithful’ only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled ‘Luxembourg,’ and having some business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose ‘day’ it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor’s-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon.
画家生病了，科塔德博士建议他出海旅行。一些“信徒”谈到要陪伴他。维尔迪兰夫妇无法面对独自留在巴黎的前景，因此首先雇用了一艘游艇，最后购买了一艘游艇。因此奥黛特不断地在游轮上航行。每当她离开一段时间，斯万都会觉得自己开始疏远她，但是，每当他听说奥黛特回到巴黎时，似乎这种道德距离与他们之间的物理距离成正比，见不到她他就无法休息。有一次，正如大家所想，他们离开只有一个月，要么他们屈服于一系列的诱惑，要么维尔迪兰先生为了取悦他的妻子而巧妙地预先安排了一切，并向“忠实的信徒”透露了他的计划。 ’只是随着时间的推移；不管怎样，他们从阿尔及尔飞往突尼斯。然后到意大利、希腊、君士坦丁堡、小亚细亚。他们已经离开将近一年了，斯旺感到非常轻松，几乎是幸福的。尽管维尔迪兰先生竭力说服钢琴家和科塔尔医生，他们各自的姨妈和病人不需要他们，而且无论如何，让夫人来是非常鲁莽的。科塔尔夫人返回巴黎。维尔迪兰向他保证，一场革命刚刚爆发，他有义务在君士坦丁堡给予他们自由。画家和他们一起回家了。有一天，这四位旅行者回来后不久，斯万看到一辆公共汽车向他驶来，贴着“卢森堡”的标签，在那里有事，就跳上车，发现自己坐在夫人对面。 科塔尔正在拜访那些“今天”的人们，按照完整的审查顺序，她的帽子上插着一根羽毛，穿着丝质连衣裙，手袋，雨伞（如果雨停了，这可以当阳伞使用） ）、一个名片盒，以及一双刚从清洁工处取出的白手套。戴着这些军衔徽章，天气好的时候，她会步行从一栋房子到同一街区的另一栋房子，但当她必须前往另一个地区时，她会使用公共汽车的转乘票。在最初的一两分钟里，直到那个女人的自然礼貌冲破了医生妻子僵硬的表面，她也不确定是否应该在斯万面前提到维尔迪兰一家，她很自然地用她缓慢的语气说道。她的声音虽然笨拙，但并非不吸引人，时不时地完全被公共汽车的嘎嘎声淹没，她从那些她拾取的话题中挑选出来，并在她楼梯上的每一栋房子里重复一遍。用了一个下午的时间爬上去。

‘I needn’t ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that the whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It’s the same in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but Machard’s portrait; you aren’t smart, you aren’t really cultured, you aren’t up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard’s portrait.’
“我不用问你，斯万先生，像你这样热衷于运动的人是否去过米里顿，看看全巴黎都在追捧的马查德的肖像画。嗯，你觉得怎么样？你属于谁的阵营，祝福者还是诅咒者？现在巴黎的每一栋房子都一样，除了马查德的肖像之外，没有人会谈论其他任何事情；除非你对马查德的肖像发表意见，否则你不聪明，你没有真正的文化，你不是与时俱进的。

Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission.
斯旺夫人回答说他没有见过这幅肖像。科塔尔担心她强迫他承认自己的疏忽可能会伤害他的感情。

‘Oh, that’s quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite frank about it. You don’t consider yourself disgraced because you haven’t seen Machard’s portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it’s just ideal. Of course, she’s not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend Biche paints. That’s quite clear. But I must tell you, perfectly frankly (you’ll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always say just what I think), that I don’t understand his work. I can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes; and it’s certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the Doctor’s colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she’s got something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that she’d rather have Leloir. I’m only a wretched Philistine, and I’ve no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when it’s going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.’
‘噢，那完全没问题！至少你有勇气坦白地说出来。你不会因为没有看到马查德的肖像而认为自己丢脸。我确实认为你真好。现在，我已经看到了；意见分歧，你知道，有些人认为它很费力，就像生奶油一样，他们说；但我认为这只是理想状态。当然，她一点也不像我们的朋友比什画的蓝色和黄色的女士。这很清楚。但我必须非常坦白地告诉你（你会认为我非常守旧，但我总是说我的想法），我不理解他的作品。我可以从他对我丈夫的描述中看到很多优点；哦，天哪，是的；这当然没有他所做的大多数事情那么奇怪，但即便如此，他也不得不给这个可怜的人留一顶蓝色的小胡子！但是马查德！现在听听这个，我朋友的丈夫，我此刻正在去看望你的路上（这让我非常高兴有你的陪伴），他向她保证，如果他被选入学院（他是博士的同事之一），他会让马查德为她画肖像。所以她有一些值得期待的事情！我的另一个朋友坚持认为她更喜欢勒卢瓦。我只是一个可怜的庸人，我毫不怀疑勒卢瓦的绘画知识甚至比马查德还要多。但我确实认为肖像画最重要的一点是，尤其是当它要花费一万法郎时，它应该是像，而且是令人愉快的相似，如果你明白我的意思的话。

Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of speaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these.
在讲完这个话题之后，她的灵感来自于她那高耸的羽毛、名片盒上的花押字、清洁工在她每只手套上刻的小数字，以及与斯万谈论维尔迪兰家族的困难，女士。科塔尔看到他们还有很长的路要走，才能到达波拿巴街的拐角处，售票员要把她放下来，于是她听从了内心的提示，除了这些之外，她还建议说其他的话。

‘Your ears must have been burning,’ she ventured, ‘while we were on the yacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.’
“当我们和夫人一起在游艇上时，你的耳朵一定很烫，”她大胆地说。韦尔迪兰。我们一直在谈论你。

Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins’ presence.
斯万真的很惊讶，因为他认为他的名字从来没有在维尔迪兰家族面前被提及过。

‘You see,’ Mme. Cottard went on, ‘Mme. de Crécy was there; need I say more? When Odette is anywhere it’s never long before she begins talking about you. And you know quite well, it isn’t nasty things she says. What! you don’t believe me!’ she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends: ‘Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I’m sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one’s place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for instance, she would say, ‘If only we had him here, he’s the man who could tell us whether it’s genuine or not. There’s no one like him for that.’ And all day long she would be saying, ‘What can he be doing just now? I do hope, he’s doing a little work! It’s too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.’ (Forgive me, won’t you.) ‘I can see him this very moment; he’s thinking of us, he’s wondering where we are.’ Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, ‘How in the world can you see what he’s doing, when he’s a thousand miles away?’ And Odette answered, ‘Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.’
“你瞧，”夫人。科塔尔继续说道：“夫人。”德·克雷西也在场。需要我多说？当奥黛特在任何地方时，她很快就会开始谈论你。你很清楚，她说的并不是难听的话。什么！你不相信我！”她继续说道，注意到斯弗兰看上去很怀疑。而且，她被她的信念的真诚所感动，没有在这个词中添加任何邪恶的含义，她使用这个词纯粹是为了表达将一对朋友团结在一起的感情：“为什么，她崇拜你” ！不，确实如此；我敢肯定，当她在场的时候，你绝对不会说任何反对你的话。人们很快就会知道自己的位置！例如，无论我们在做什么，如果我们正在看一张照片，她会说，“如果他在这里就好了，他就是那个可以告诉我们这幅画是真是假的人。”没有人比他更擅长这一点。”而她整天都会说：“他现在能做什么？我确实希望，他正在做一些工作！一个有如此天赋的人竟然如此懒惰，这太可怕了。”（请原谅我，不是吗？） “他在想我们，他在想我们在哪里。”确实，她用了一种我当时认为非常漂亮的表达方式。维尔迪兰先生问她：“他在一千英里之外，你到底怎么能看到他在做什么？”奥黛特回答说：“在朋友看来，没有什么是不可能的。”

‘No, I assure you, I’m not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true friend in her, such as one doesn’t often find. I can tell you, besides, in case you don’t know it, that you’re the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don’t you know, before a parting), ‘I don’t say that Odette isn’t fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann might say.’ Oh, mercy, there’s the conductor stopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?’
“不，我向你保证，我这么说并不是为了奉承你；我只是为了奉承你。”你在她身上找到了一位真正的朋友，但这种朋友并不常见。此外，我可以告诉你，万一你不知道的话，你是唯一的一个。女士。在我们和他们在一起的最后一天，维尔迪兰亲自对我说了同样的话（在分别之前，一个人说话更自由，你知道吗），“我不是说奥黛特不喜欢我们，而是我们可能说的任何话对她来说，除了斯旺可能说的话之外，其他的都毫无意义。我一直在这儿和你聊天，本来会直接经过波拿巴街，但从来没有注意到……你能好心告诉我我的羽毛是否直吗？

And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went.
还有女士。科塔尔从她的手筒里抽出来，把它递给斯旺，一只戴着白手套的手上飘浮着一张临时车票，一种时尚生活的气氛弥漫在公共汽车里，与刚清洗过的羊肉的更刺鼻的香味混合在一起。斯万感到自己对她以及对夫人充满了感激之情。维尔迪兰（几乎对奥黛特来说，因为他现在对她的感情不再带有痛苦，现在甚至几乎不能用爱来形容），而他在公共汽车的月台上，用充满爱意的目光跟随她，当她沿着波拿巴街英勇地穿行时，她的羽毛竖立着，一手举着裙子，另一只手紧握着雨伞和名片盒，这样就可以看到它的花押字，她的手筒在街边舞动。当她走的时候，空气就在她面前。

To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal, feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann’s mind were to make Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter’s, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness.
为了与斯万竞争并激发斯旺对奥黛特的垂死感情，夫人。科塔尔是一位更明智的医生，在这种情况下，比她的丈夫更聪明，在他们之间嫁接了其他更正常的感情，感激之情，友谊，在斯旺看来，这将使奥黛特再次显得更加人性化（更像其他女人） ，因为其他女人也能在他身上激发出同样的感觉），是为了加速她最后的转变，回到那个奥黛特，被一种不受干扰的感情所爱，有一天晚上，她在画家家狂欢后带他回家，和福什维尔一起喝橙水，斯旺以为他和奥黛特可以幸福地生活在一起。

In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette’s lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered—though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy—and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette’s lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished—in thought at least—to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: ‘I must go.’ She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. ‘They had obviously arranged it between them,’ he added; ‘they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn’t say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress.’ The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. ‘After all, she is quite right,’ he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease. ‘I’ve advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her.’ So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the ‘first person’ in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped with a fez.
以前，他经常惊恐地想到，有一天他一定会不再爱奥黛特，因此他决定保持警惕，一旦他感到爱情开始离开他，紧紧地抓住它并阻止它。但现在，与他的爱的淡漠相对应的是，他想要继续做她的情人的愿望也随之淡漠了。因为一个人如果继续服从他已经不再是的自我的指令，就无法改变，也就是说，他无法成为另一个人。偶尔，如果他在报纸上看到一个他认为是奥黛特情人的男人的名字，就会重新唤起他的嫉妒。但这是非常轻微的，而且，因为这向他证明，他还没有完全摆脱那个让他如此痛苦的时期——尽管在那个时期他也知道了一种感觉如此强烈的幸福的方式——而且那些事故他的路线可能仍然使他能够偶尔偷偷地、在远处瞥见它的美丽，这种嫉妒给了他一种愉快的兴奋，如果有的话，就像悲伤的巴黎人一样，当他把威尼斯抛​​在身后，必须回到法国，最后一只蚊子证明意大利离夏天还不太遥远。 但是，一般来说，在他生命中的这个特殊时期，当他努力摆脱这个时期时，即使他不能留在其中，至少也要获得不间断的视角，他发现已经太晚了；他会回过头去辨别，因为这可能是一片即将消失的风景，他已经离开了那份爱，但要进入一种完全二元性的状态，向自己呈现那栩栩如生的景象是多么困难。一种人们已经不再拥有的感觉，很快，乌云在他的大脑中聚集，他什么也看不见，他会放弃尝试，会从鼻子上取下眼镜并擦拭它们；他告诉自己，他最好休息一会儿，以后还有足够的时间，然后又坐回到自己的角落里，没有什么好奇心，就像昏昏欲睡的旅行者把帽子拉下来盖住自己的帽子一样麻木。他感觉自己越来越快地离开了这个他生活了这么久的国家，他发誓他不会让这个国家溜走。没有打算向他作最后的告别。事实上，就像同一个旅行者一样，如果他直到越过边境并再次回到法国才醒来，当斯万碰巧在近在咫尺的东西上下车时，他发现福什维尔曾是奥黛特的情人，他发现这引起了他没有感到痛苦，爱情现在已经完全遥远了，他后悔自己没有得到任何警告，知道自己永远摆脱爱情的那一刻。 正如，在第一次亲吻奥黛特之前，他曾试图将这张熟悉已久的脸印在记忆中，然后再被他们亲吻的额外记忆所改变，所以他本可以希望——在思考中至少——在她还存在的时候，能够告别那个激发了他的爱和嫉妒的奥黛特，告别那个让他如此痛苦的奥黛特，而现在他再也见不到她了。他错了。几周后，他注定要再次见到她。那是在他睡着的时候，在梦的黄昏里。他和夫人一起散步。维尔迪兰、科塔尔博士、一个戴着毡帽的年轻人（他无法辨认出他的身份）、画家、奥黛特、拿破仑三世和我的祖父，沿着一条沿着海岸线的小路，悬在大海上，现在处于很高的高度，现在只有几英尺了，所以他们不断地上下移动；那些已经到达下坡的人不再被那些仍在攀登的人看到；所剩无几的日光即将消失，黑夜似乎马上就要降临到他们身上。海浪时不时地冲击着悬崖，斯万能感觉到他的脸颊上有一阵冰冷的水花。奥黛特让他把它擦掉，但他不能，在她的陪伴下，以及因为他穿着睡衣，他感到困惑和无助。他希望，在黑暗中，这一切可能不会被注意到。女士。然而维尔迪兰用惊讶的目光盯着他看了好一会儿，他看到她的脸变了形状，鼻子变长了，鼻子下面长出了浓密的小胡子。 他转过身去检查奥黛特。她的脸颊苍白，布满火红的小斑点，五官憔悴，周围笼罩着阴影。但她回头看着他，眼睛里充满了爱意，准备像泪水一样分离，落在他的脸上，他觉得他是如此爱她，恨不得立刻把她带走。突然，奥黛特转动手腕，看了一眼小手表，说道：“我必须走了。”她以同样正式的方式向大家告别，没有把斯旺拉到一边，也没有告诉他今晚在哪里见面，或者明天。他不敢问，他很想跟着她，他不得不微笑着回答她的一些问题，头也不回地朝她的方向走去。维尔迪兰；但他的心却在疯狂地跳动，他觉得自己现在恨奥黛特了，他很乐意捏碎那双眼睛，而就在刚才，他还深爱着这双眼睛，它们把血撕成了毫无生气的脸颊。他继续和夫人一起攀登。维尔迪兰，也就是说，每走一步，他就离正在下坡的奥黛特更远一些，而且是朝另一个方向走。一秒钟过去了，距离她离开他已经好几个小时了。画家对斯万说，拿破仑三世在奥黛特之后就黯然失色了。 “这显然是他们之间安排的，”他补充道。 “他们一定是约定在悬崖脚下见面，但他们不会一起告别；这可能看起来很奇怪。她是他的情妇。”陌生的年轻人泪流满面。斯旺尽力安慰他。 “毕竟，她说得很对。”他对年轻人说道，替他擦干眼睛，摘下毡帽，让他感觉更自在一些。 “我自己已经多次建议她这么做了。为何如此苦恼？他显然是最能理解她的男人。’斯旺这样自言自语，因为他一开始没能认出的那个年轻人也是他自己。像某些小说家一样，他把自己的个性分配给两个角色，他是梦中的“第一个人”，另一个是他在他面前看到的、戴着毡帽的人。

As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron’s usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: ‘Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire.’ It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:—-
至于拿破仑三世，斯万是因为一些模糊的想法联想到福什维尔，然后对男爵惯常的相貌进行了某种修改，最后在他胸前佩戴了荣誉军团勋章的宽丝带，才给了这个名字。但实际上，在他梦中出现的人所代表和回忆的一切中，确实是福什维尔。因为，斯旺在睡梦中从一组不完整且不断变化的图像中得出了错误的推论，同时享受着如此强大的创造力，以至于他能够通过简单的分裂行为来复制自己，就像某些低等生物一样；他用自己手掌中感受到的温暖，模仿了一只陌生的手的空心，他认为自己正在握着这只手，出于他尚未意识到的感觉和印象，他带来了突然的沧桑，通过一条链条逻辑序列，会在他梦中的特定时刻产生接受他的爱或把他惊醒的人。刹那间，他的周围变得漆黑一片；警报响起，居民们从他身边跑过，逃离着火的房屋。他能听到汹涌的海浪的雷鸣声，也能听到自己的心，同样剧烈地在他的胸口焦急地跳动。突然间，心悸的速度加快了一倍，他感到一种莫名的疼痛、恶心；当他经过时，一个被严重烧伤的农民向他猛扑过去：“快来问问查勒斯，奥黛特和她的朋友在哪里过夜。”他常常和她一起出去，她把一切都告诉他。是他们放火的。’是他的男仆过来叫醒他，说道：——

‘Sir, it is eight o’clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour.’
“先生，现在八点了，理发师来了。”我已经告诉他一个小时后再打电话。”

But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer—Mlle. Legrandin that had been—was spending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again—and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s, at which he had introduced General de Frober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,—the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish—were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity.
但是，当斯旺沉浸在睡眠的波浪中时，这些话在没有经过将一碗水底部的一束光变成另一个太阳的折射之前就没有到达他的意识；就在刚才，门铃的声音在他的睡梦深处逐渐变成了警报的铿锵声，引发了火灾。与此同时，他梦中舞台的风景散落在尘土中，他睁开眼睛，最后一次听到海中波浪的轰鸣声，声音变得很远。他摸了摸脸颊。天气很干燥。但他仍能感觉到冰冷的水花的刺痛，以及嘴唇上的咸味。他站起来，穿好衣服。他让理发师提前来了，因为他前一天写信给我祖父，说他得知夫人的消息后，那天下午要去贡布雷。德·康布勒梅尔——Mlle。勒格朗丹曾经——在那里待了几天。在他的记忆中，她年轻而迷人的脸庞与他很久没有去过的这个国家的一个地方的联系，给他带来了一种综合的吸引力，使他最终决定暂时离开巴黎一段时间。因为，在这一生中，让我们与某些其他人相伴的不同变化和机会，并不与我们爱上这些人的时期同时发生，而是，它们重叠，可能发生在爱情开始之前，也可能发生在我们与这些人相爱的时期。爱情结束后，我们生命中最早出现的、注定会为我们带来快乐的生物，在我们的眼中回顾性地呈现出某种价值，作为一种指示、一种警告、一种预示。 正是以这种方式，斯旺经常把他的思绪带回到在剧院遇到的奥黛特的形象，那是在第一个晚上，当时他不想再见到她——现在他回忆起在夫人那里举行的聚会。 de Saint-Euverte’s，在那里他把德弗罗伯维尔将军介绍给了夫人。德康布雷默。我们生活中的兴趣如此广泛，以至于在某一时刻，尚未存在的幸福的基础与我们仍在遭受的悲伤的加剧同时奠定，这种情况并不少见。毫无疑问，斯万可能在其他地方而不是在夫人那里想到过这一点。德圣埃维尔特。事实上，谁能说，如果他走了，那天晚上，在其他地方，其他的幸福、其他的悲伤是否不会降临到他身上，而后来这似乎是不可避免的呢？但在他看来，似乎不可避免的事情确实发生了，而且他最终决定去见夫人，这离他看到了一些天意。那天晚上，德·圣埃维尔特的到来，因为他的头脑急于欣赏生活所展现的丰富的发明，并且无法在任何长时间内面对难题，例如发现人们实际上最希望得到的是什么，得出的结论是，那天晚上他所经历的痛苦，以及当时毫无疑问的、已经诞生的快乐——两者之间的确切平衡太难建立——是通过某种方式联系在一起的。必然性的串联。

But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette’s pallid complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which—in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her—he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: ‘To think that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my style!’
但是，在他醒来一小时后，当他向理发师发出指示，以免他梳得硬邦邦的头发在旅途中变得凌乱时，他再次想起了他的梦；他再次看到了奥黛特苍白的肤色，她太瘦的脸颊，她憔悴的面容，她疲倦的眼睛，所有这些——在他不断爆发的感情过程中，使他对他们产生了感情。由于对奥黛特的爱持久，他已经忘记了他对她的第一印象——在他们亲密接触的最初几天之后，他就不再观察了，毫无疑问，在这些日子里，当他睡觉时，他的记忆又恢复了，以寻找确切的印象。对那些事物的感觉。那种古老的、断断续续的愚蠢，现在他不再不快乐了，又重新出现在他身上，同时降低了他道德的平均水平，他在心里大声呼喊：“想想看，我已经浪费了几年的时间。”我的一生，我渴望死亡，我所知道的最伟大的爱是对一个不让我高兴、不符合我风格的女人！

PLACE-NAMES: THE NAME
地名：名称

Among the rooms which used most commonly to take shape in my mind during my long nights of sleeplessness, there was none that differed more utterly from the rooms at Combray, thickly powdered with the motes of an atmosphere granular, pollenous, edible and instinct with piety, than my room in the Grand Hôtel de la Plage, at Balbec, the walls of which, washed with ripolin, contained, like the polished sides of a basin in which the water glows with a blue, lurking fire, a finer air, pure, azure-tinted, saline. The Bavarian upholsterer who had been entrusted with the furnishing of this hotel had varied his scheme of decoration in different rooms, and in that which I found myself occupying had set against the walls, on three sides of it, a series of low book-cases with glass fronts, in which, according to where they stood, by a law of nature which he had, perhaps, forgotten to take into account, was reflected this or that section of the ever-changing view of the sea, so that the walls were lined with a frieze of sea-scapes, interrupted only by the polished mahogany of the actual shelves. And so effective was this that the whole room had the appearance of one of those model bedrooms which you see nowadays in Housing Exhibitions, decorated with works of art which are calculated by their designer to refresh the eyes of whoever may ultimately have to sleep in the rooms, the subjects being kept in some degree of harmony with the locality and surroundings of the houses for which the rooms are planned.
在我漫长的不眠之夜中，我脑海中最常见的房间中，没有一个房间与贡布雷的房间有更大的不同，那里厚厚地撒满了颗粒状、花粉状、可食用的、虔诚的本能大气的微粒。 ，比我在巴尔贝克的德拉普拉日大酒店的房间要好，房间的墙壁用里波林清洗过，就像一个水盆抛光的侧面，里面的水闪烁着蓝色的光芒，潜伏着火，空气更细腻，纯净，天蓝色，盐水。负责这家酒店装修的巴伐利亚室内装潢师在不同的房间里改变了他的装饰方案，而我发现自己住的房间在它的三个侧面靠墙放置了一系列低矮的书架玻璃正面，根据它们所处的位置，根据他也许忘记考虑到的自然法则，反映了不断变化的大海景色的这个或那个部分，因此墙壁里面排列着海景饰带，只有抛光的桃花心木架子打断了它们。这种做法非常有效，以至于整个房间的外观就像你现在在住房展览中看到的样板卧室之一，装饰着艺术品，这些艺术品是由设计师计算出来的，目的是让那些最终不得不睡在卧室里的人焕然一新。房间，主题与房间规划的房屋的地点和周围环境保持一定程度的和谐。

And yet nothing could have differed more utterly, either, from the real Balbec than that other Balbec of which I had often dreamed, on stormy days, when the wind was so strong that Françoise, as she took me to the Champs-Elysées, would warn me not to walk too near the side of the street, or I might have my head knocked off by a falling slate, and would recount to me, with many lamentations, the terrible disasters and shipwrecks that were reported in the newspaper. I longed for nothing more than to behold a storm at sea, less as a mighty spectacle than as a momentary revelation of the true life of nature; or rather there were for me no mighty spectacles save those which I knew to be not artificially composed for my entertainment, but necessary and unalterable,—the beauty of landscapes or of great works of art. I was not curious, I did not thirst to know anything save what I believed to be more genuine than myself, what had for me the supreme merit of shewing me a fragment of the mind of a great genius, or of the force or the grace of nature as she appeared when left entirely to herself, without human interference. Just as the lovely sound of her voice, reproduced, all by itself, upon the phonograph, could never console a man for the loss of his mother, so a mechanical imitation of a storm would have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the Exhibition. I required also, if the storm was to be absolutely genuine, that the shore from which I watched it should be a natural shore, not an embankment recently constructed by a municipality. Besides, nature, by all the feelings that she aroused in me, seemed to me the most opposite thing in the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind The less she bore their imprint, the more room she offered for the expansion of my heart. And, as it happened, I had preserved the name of Balbec, which Legrandin had cited to us, as that of a sea-side place in the very midst of ‘that funereal coast, famed for the number of its wrecks, swathed, for six months in the year, in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the waves.
然而，没有什么比真正的巴尔贝克更完全不同了，在暴风雨的日子里，我经常梦见另一个巴尔贝克，当时风很大，弗朗索瓦丝带我去香榭丽舍大街时，警告我不要走得太靠近街边，否则我的头可能会被落下的石板砸下来，然后他会带着许多悲痛的声音向我讲述报纸上报道的可怕的灾难和沉船事件。我最渴望的就是亲眼目睹海上的暴风雨，与其说是一场巨大的奇观，不如说是大自然真实生命的瞬间展现；或者更确切地说，对我来说，除了那些我知道不是为了娱乐而人工创作的、而是必要且不可改变的奇观——风景或伟大艺术作品的美丽之外，没有什么伟大的奇观。我并不好奇，我不渴望知道任何事情，除了我认为比我自己更真实的东西，对我来说最有价值的东西，可以向我展示一位伟大天才的思想碎片，或者力量或优雅的碎片。当她完全不受人类干扰时，她所呈现的自然状态。正如她那可爱的声音，在留声机上独自再现，永远无法安慰一个失去母亲的人一样，机械地模仿暴风雨也会让我感到寒冷，就像在灯光下的喷泉一样。展览。我还要求，如果风暴是绝对真实的，我观看风暴的海岸应该是天然海岸，而不是市政当局最近建造的堤坝。 此外，从她在我心中激起的所有感觉来看，大自然对我来说似乎是世界上与人类的机械发明最相反的东西，她越少带有人类的印记，她为我的心灵扩展提供的空间就越大。而且，碰巧的是，我保留了勒格朗丹向我们引用过的巴尔贝克这个名字，因为它是“那个葬礼海岸正中间的一个海边地方，以其沉船数量而闻名，被包裹着，一年中有六个月，雾气弥漫，海浪飞溅。

‘You feel, there, below your feet still,’ he had told me, ‘far more even than at Finistère (and even though hotels are now being superimposed upon it, without power, however, to modify that oldest bone in the earth’s skeleton) you feel there that you are actually at the land’s end of France, of Europe, of the Old World. And it is the ultimate encampment of the fishermen, precisely like the fishermen who have lived since the world’s beginning, facing the everlasting kingdom of the sea-fogs and shadows of the night.’ One day when, at Combray, I had spoken of this coast, this Balbec, before M. Swann, hoping to learn from him whether it was the best point to select for seeing the most violent storms, he had replied: ‘I should think I did know Balbec! The church at Balbec, built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and still half romanesque, is perhaps the most curious example to be found of our Norman gothic, and so exceptional that one is tempted to describe it as Persian in its inspiration.’ And that region, which, until then, had seemed to me to be nothing else than a part of immemorial nature, that had remained contemporaneous with the great phenomena of geology—and as remote from human history as the Ocean itself, or the Great Bear, with its wild race of fishermen for whom, no more than for their whales, had there been any Middle Ages—it had been a great joy to me to see it suddenly take its place in the order of the centuries, with a stored consciousness of the romanesque epoch, and to know that the gothic trefoil had come to diversify those wild rocks also, at the appointed hour, like those frail but hardy plants which, in the Polar regions, when the spring returns, scatter their stars about the eternal snows. And if gothic art brought to those places and people a classification which, otherwise, they lacked, they too conferred one upon it in return. I tried to form a picture in my mind of how those fishermen had lived, the timid and unsuspected essay towards social intercourse which they had attempted there, clustered upon a promontory of the shores of Hell, at the foot of the cliffs of death; and gothic art seemed to me a more living thing now that, detaching it from the towns in which, until then, I had always imagined it, I could see how, in a particular instance, upon a reef of savage rocks, it had taken root and grown until it flowered in a tapering spire. I was taken to see reproductions of the most famous of the statues at Balbec,—shaggy, blunt-faced Apostles, the Virgin from the porch,—and I could scarcely breathe for joy at the thought that I might myself, one day, see them take a solid form against their eternal background of salt fog. Thereafter, on dear, tempestuous February nights, the wind—breathing into my heart, which it shook no less violently than the chimney of my bedroom, the project of a visit to Balbec—blended in me the desire for gothic architecture with that for a storm upon the sea.
他对我说：“你感觉脚下还在，”他告诉我，“比菲尼斯泰尔还要平坦（尽管现在酒店都在上面，但没有能力改变地球骨骼中最古老的骨头）” ）在那里，你感觉自己实际上身处法国、欧洲、旧世界的尽头。它是渔民们的终极营地，就像自世界诞生以来一直生活在海雾和夜影的永恒王国里的渔民一样。”有一天，在贡布雷，我谈到了这一点。海岸，这个巴尔贝克，在斯旺先生面前，希望向他了解这是否是观看最猛烈风暴的最佳地点，他回答说：“我应该认为我确实了解巴尔贝克！”巴尔贝克教堂建于十二世纪和十三世纪，仍然具有半罗马式风格，也许是我们诺曼哥特式建筑中最奇怪的例子，它如此独特，以至于人们很想将其描述为波斯风格的灵感。直到那时，那个地区在我看来只不过是远古自然的一部分，与伟大的地质现象同时存在——并且像海洋本身或大熊一样远离人类历史，对于他们来说，就像他们的鲸鱼一样，有过中世纪吗？看到它突然在几个世纪的时间里占据一席之地，我感到非常高兴，并储存了一种意识罗马式时代，并知道哥特式三叶草也已在指定的时间使这些野生岩石多样化，就像那些脆弱但耐寒的植物一样，在极地地区，当春天回来时，它们的星星散布在永恒的雪上。 如果哥特式艺术给这些地方和人民带来了一种他们所缺乏的分类，那么作为回报，他们也赋予了这种分类。我试图在脑海中描绘出那些渔民是如何生活的，他们在地狱海岸的海岬上，在死亡悬崖的脚下，尝试着胆怯而毫无戒心地进行社交活动；现在，哥特式艺术对我来说似乎是一个更加生动的事物，因为，将它与我一直想象的城镇分开，我可以看到它是如何在一个特定的例子中，在一片原始岩石的礁石上，生根并生长，直到在锥形尖顶上开花。我被带去参观巴尔贝克最著名的雕像的复制品——毛茸茸的、面无表情的使徒、门廊上的圣母——想到有一天我自己也能亲眼目睹，我高兴得几乎无法呼吸。它们在永恒的盐雾背景下呈现出坚固的形状。此后，在亲爱的、暴风雨的二月夜晚，风吹进我的心，它的震动不亚于我卧室的烟囱，因为我要去巴尔贝克参观，我对哥特式建筑的渴望与对哥特式建筑的渴望融为一体。海上的风暴。

I should have liked to take, the very next day, the good, the generous train at one twenty-two, of which never without a palpitating heart could I read, in the railway company’s bills or in advertisements of circular tours, the hour of departure: it seemed to me to cut, at a precise point in every afternoon, a most fascinating groove, a mysterious mark, from which the diverted hours still led one on, of course, towards evening, towards to-morrow morning, but to an evening and morning which one would behold, not in Paris but in one of those towns through which the train passed and among which it allowed one to choose; for it stopped at Bayeux, at Coutances, at Vitré, at Questambert, at Pontorson, at Balbec, at Lannion, at Lamballe, at Benodet, at Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and progressed magnificently surcharged with names which it offered me, so that, among them all, I did not know which to choose, so impossible was it to sacrifice any. But even without waiting for the train next day, I could, by rising and dressing myself with all speed, leave Paris that very evening, should my parents permit, and arrive at Balbec as dawn spread westward over the raging sea, from whose driven foam I would seek shelter in that church in the Persian manner. But at the approach of the Easter holidays, when my parents bad promised to let me spend them, for once, in the North of Italy, lo! in place of those dreams of tempests, by which I had been entirely possessed, not wishing to see anything but waves dashing in from all sides, mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts, beside churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers the sea-birds would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away all their charm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could only have weakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream of the most variegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still pricking with all the needle-points of the winter’s frost, but that which already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of Fiesole, and gave Florence a dazzling golden background, like those in Fra Angelico’s pictures. From that moment, only sunlight, perfumes, colours, seemed to me to have any value; for this alternation of images had effected a change of front in my desire, and—as abrupt as those that occur sometimes in music,—a complete change of tone in my sensibility. Thus it came about that a mere atmospheric variation would be sufficient to provoke in me that modulation, without there being any need for me to await the return of a season. For often we find a day, in one, that has strayed from another season, and makes us live in that other, summons at once into our presence and makes us long for its peculiar pleasures, and interrupts the dreams that we were in process of weaving, by inserting, out of its turn, too early or too late, this leaf, torn from another chapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness. But soon it happened that, like those natural phenomena from which our comfort or our health can derive but an accidental and all too modest benefit, until the day when science takes control of them, and, producing them at will, places in our hands the power to order their appearance, withdrawn from the tutelage and independent of the consent of chance; similarly the production of these dreams of the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to depend entirely upon the changes of the seasons and of the weather. I need only, to make them reappear, pronounce the names: Balbec, Venice, Florence, within whose syllables had gradually accumulated all the longing inspired in me by the places for which they stood. Even in spring, to come in a book upon the name of Balbec sufficed to awaken in me the desire for storms at sea and for the Norman gothic; even on a stormy day the name of Florence or of Venice would awaken the desire for sunshine, for lilies, for the Palace of the Doges and for Santa Maria del Fiore.
我本想第二天就乘坐一班二十二分的好火车，在铁路公司的账单或环游广告上，我总是会心悸地读到火车的运行时间。出发：在我看来，在每个下午的某个精确时刻，都切出了一个最迷人的凹槽，一个神秘的标记，从中转移的时间仍然引导着一个人，当然，走向晚上，走向明天的早晨，但到人们所看到的傍晚和早晨，不是在巴黎，而是在火车经过的那些城镇之一，火车可以在其中选择一个；因为它停在巴约、库坦斯、维特雷、奎坦贝尔、蓬托尔松、巴尔贝克、拉尼翁、兰巴勒、贝诺代、阿旺桥、坎佩尔，并且在它给我提供的名字的帮助下，宏伟地前进了，所以在所有这些之中，我不知道该选择哪一个，所以不可能牺牲任何一个。但即使第二天不用等火车，如果我父母允许的话，我也可以起床并全速穿好衣服，当天晚上就离开巴黎，到达巴尔贝克，黎明时分，黎明向西蔓延到汹涌的大海上，汹涌的泡沫从大海上涌出。我会以波斯方式在那个教堂寻求庇护。但在复活节假期临近时，我的父母答应让我在意大利北部度过这一次，瞧！ 代替那些暴风雨的梦想，我完全被它所迷惑，除了海浪从四面八方冲来、总是升得更高、在最狂野的海岸上、在像悬崖一样崎岖陡峭的教堂旁边之外，我不想看到任何东西。海鸟会在高塔上哀鸣；突然间，抹去了它们，夺走了它们所有的魅力，排除了它们，因为它们是它的对立面，只会削弱它的效果，在我身上取而代之的是最丰富多彩的泉水的相反梦想，而不是贡布雷的泉水，仍然刺痛着所有的东西。冬天霜冻的针尖，但菲耶索莱的草地上已经长满了百合花和海葵，给佛罗伦萨带来了耀眼的金色背景，就像弗拉·安杰利科的画中的那样。从那一刻起，在我看来，只有阳光、香水、色彩才有价值；只有阳光、香水、色彩才具有价值。因为这种形象的交替改变了我的欲望，而且——就像音乐中有时发生的那样突然——彻底改变了我的情感基调。因此，仅仅大气的变化就足以激发我的这种调节，而无需我等待季节的回归。因为我们经常会发现某一天偏离了另一个季节，使我们生活在另一个季节，立即召唤到我们面前，使我们渴望它特有的快乐，并打断我们正在进行的梦想。编织，通过插入，不按顺序插入，太早或太晚，这片叶子，从另一章撕下来，在幸福的插值日历中。 但很快，就像那些自然现象一样，我们的舒适或健康只能从中获得偶然的、微乎其微的好处，直到科学控制它们并随意生产它们的那一天，将它们置于我们手中有权命令他们出现，脱离监护并独立于机会的同意；同样，大西洋和意大利这些梦想的产生也不再完全取决于季节和天气的变化。为了让它们重新出现，我只需念出这些名字：巴尔贝克、威尼斯、佛罗伦萨，它们的音节逐渐积聚了我对它们所代表的地方所激发的所有渴望。即使在春天，一本关于巴尔贝克这个名字的书也足以唤醒我对海上风暴和诺曼哥特式的渴望；即使在暴风雨的日子，佛罗伦萨或威尼斯的名字也会唤醒人们对阳光、百合花、总督宫和圣母百花大教堂的渴望。

But if their names thus permanently absorbed the image that I had formed of these towns, it was only by transforming that image, by subordinating its reappearance in me to their own special laws; and in consequence of this they made it more beautiful, but at the same time more different from anything that the towns of Normandy or Tuscany could in reality be, and, by increasing the arbitrary delights of my imagination, aggravated the disenchantment that was in store for me when I set out upon my travels. They magnified the idea that I formed of certain points on the earth’s surface, making them more special, and in consequence more real. I did not then represent to myself towns, landscapes, historic buildings, as pictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there of a substance that was common to them all, but looked on each of them as on an unknown thing, different from all the rest, a thing for which my soul was athirst, by the knowledge of which it would benefit. How much more individual still was the character that they assumed from being designated by names, names that were only for themselves, proper names such as people have. Words present to us little pictures of things, lucid and normal, like the pictures that are hung on the walls of schoolrooms to give children an illustration of what is meant by a carpenter’s bench, a bird, an ant-hill; things chosen as typical of everything else of the same sort. But names present to us—of persons and of towns which they accustom us to regard as individual, as unique, like persons—a confused picture, which draws from the names, from the brightness or darkness of their sound, the colour in which it is uniformly painted, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely red, in which, on account of the limitations imposed by the process used in their reproduction, or by a whim on the designer’s part, are blue or red not only the sky and the sea, but the ships and the church and the people in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns that I most longed to visit, after reading the Chartreuse, seeming to me compact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, if anyone were to speak of such or such a house in Parma, in which I should be lodged, he would give me the pleasure of thinking that I was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, and that bore no relation to the houses in any other town in Italy, since I could imagine it only by the aid of that heavy syllable of the name of Parma, in which no breath of air stirred, and of all that I had made it assume of Stendhalian sweetness and the reflected hue of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was of a town miraculously embalmed, and flower-like, since it was called the City of the Lilies, and its Cathedral, Our Lady of the Flower. As for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on an old piece of Norman pottery that still keeps the colour of the earth from which it was fashioned, one sees depicted still the representation of some long-abolished custom, of some feudal right, of the former condition of some place, of an obsolete way of pronouncing the language, which had shaped and wedded its incongruous syllables and which I never doubted that I should find spoken there at once, even by the inn-keeper who would pour me out coffee and milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch the turbulent sea, unchained, before the church; to whom I lent the aspect, disputatious, solemn and mediaeval, of some character in one of the old romances.
但是，如果他们的名字就这样永久地吸收了我对这些城镇形成的形象，那只能是通过改变这个形象，使它在我身上的再现服从于他们自己的特殊法则；因此，他们使它变得更加美丽，但同时也与现实中诺曼底或托斯卡纳的城镇更加不同，并且通过增加我想象中任意的乐趣，加剧了即将到来的幻灭当我开始旅行时。他们放大了我由地球表面的某些点组成的想法，使它们更加特别，因此更加真实。那时，我并没有将城镇、风景、历史建筑描绘成或多或少有吸引力的图片，到处剪下它们共有的物质，而是将它们中的每一个视为一个未知的事物，不同于其他事物。其余的一切，都是我的灵魂所渴求的，通过了解它，我的灵魂会受益匪浅。他们从名字中获得的个性是多么的个性化，这些名字只是他们自己的名字，像人们所拥有的专有名称一样。文字向我们展示了事物的小图画，清晰而正常，就像挂在教室墙上的图画，向孩子们展示木匠的长凳、一只鸟、一座蚁丘的含义；被选为同类事物中典型的事物。 但是，名字向我们呈现了一幅混乱的图画——人物和城镇，他们习惯于将它们视为个体、独特、像人一样，它从名字、声音的明暗、声音的颜色中得出。被统一绘制，就像其中一张海报一样，完全蓝色或完全红色，其中，由于复制过程所施加的限制，或者设计师的突发奇想，不仅是天空是蓝色或红色和大海，还有船只、教堂和街上的人们。帕尔马的名字是我最渴望参观的城镇之一，读完查尔特勒斯之后，在我看来，它紧凑而有光泽，紫罗兰色，柔和，如果有人谈到帕尔马的这样或那样的房子，其中我应该被寄宿，他会让我高兴地想到，我将居住在一个紧凑、光滑、紫罗兰色、柔软的住宅里，与意大利任何其他城镇的房子没有任何关系，因为我可以想象一下，只有借助帕尔马这个沉重的音节，那里没有一丝空气的气息，我让它呈现出司汤达式的甜美和紫罗兰反射的色调。当我想到佛罗伦萨时，它是一个奇迹般地经过防腐处理、像鲜花一样的小镇，因为它被称为“百合之城”，它的大教堂是“花之圣母”。 至于巴尔贝克，它是这样的名字之一，就像在一件古老的诺曼陶器上，它仍然保留着它所用的泥土的颜色一样，人们仍然看到描绘了一些早已废除的习俗的代表，一些习俗的象征。封建权利，某个地方以前的状况，一种过时的语言发音方式，它塑造并结合了它不协调的音节，我从来没有怀疑过，我会立即发现在那里说话，即使是旅店老板我一到就给我倒了咖啡和牛奶，带我去教堂前不受束缚地观看波涛汹涌的大海；我给他呈现了一部古老浪漫小说中的人物形象，充满争议、庄严而中世纪。

Had my health definitely improved, had my parents allowed me, if not actually to go down to stay at Balbec, at least to take, just once, so as to become acquainted with the architecture and landscapes of Normandy or of Brittany, that one twenty-two train into which I had so often clambered in imagination, I should have preferred to stop, and to alight from it, at the most beautiful of its towns; but in vain might I compare and contrast them; how was one to choose, any more than between individual people, who are not interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty in its noble coronet of rusty lace, whose highest point caught the light of the old gold of its second syllable; Vitré, whose acute accent barred its ancient glass with wooden lozenges; gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness ranged from egg-shell yellow to a pearly grey; Coutances, a Norman Cathedral, which its final consonants, rich and yellowing, crowned with a tower of butter; Lannion with the rumble and buzz, in the silence of its village street, of the fly on the wheel of the coach; Questambert, Pontorson, ridiculously silly and simple, white feathers and yellow beaks strewn along the road to those well-watered and poetic spots; Benodet, a name scarcely moored that seemed to be striving to draw the river down into the tangle of its seaweeds; Pont-Aven, the snowy, rosy flight of the wing of a lightly poised coif, tremulously reflected in the greenish waters of a canal; Quimperlé, more firmly attached, this, and since the Middle Ages, among the rivulets with which it babbled, threading their pearls upon a grey background, like the pattern made, through the cobwebs upon a window, by rays of sunlight changed into blunt points of tarnished silver?
如果我的健康状况确实有所改善，如果我的父母允许我，即使不是真的去巴尔贝克，至少也只去一次，以便熟悉诺曼底或布列塔尼的建筑和风景，那一二十——我经常在想象中登上的两列火车，我本来宁愿在最美丽的城镇停下来下车；但我无法对它们进行比较和对比；就像在不可互换的个体之间，在巴约之间如何选择一样，在生锈花边的高贵王冠中如此崇高，其最高点捕捉到了第二个音节的旧金色光芒；维特雷 (Vitré) 的口音尖锐，用木质菱形挡住了古老的玻璃；温柔的兰巴勒，其白度从蛋壳黄到珍珠灰不等；库坦斯 (Coutances) 是一座诺曼大教堂，其最后的辅音丰富而泛黄，顶部有一座黄油塔；拉尼翁，在寂静的乡村街道上，马车车轮上的苍蝇发出隆隆声和嗡嗡声；奎坦伯特、蓬托尔松，傻乎乎又简单，白色的羽毛和黄色的喙散布在通向那些水源充足、充满诗意的地方的道路上；贝诺代，这个名字几乎没有停泊，似乎正在努力将河流拉入海草丛生的地方；阿文桥，一顶轻柔的头巾，雪白、玫瑰色的翅膀飞翔，颤抖地倒映在运河碧绿的水面上；坎佩莱，更牢固地依附于此，自中世纪以来，在它潺潺流淌的小溪中，将它们的珍珠穿在灰色的背景上，就像图案一样，穿过窗户上的蜘蛛网，被阳光变成了钝点失去光泽的银？

These images were false for another reason also; namely, that they were necessarily much simplified; doubtless the object to which my imagination aspired, which my senses took in but incompletely and without any immediate pleasure, I had committed to the safe custody of names; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams, those names now magnetised my desires; but names themselves are not very comprehensive; the most that I could do was to include in each of them two or three of the principal curiosities of the town, which would lie there side by side, without interval or partition; in the name of Balbec, as in the magnifying glasses set in those penholders which one buys at sea-side places, I could distinguish waves surging round a church built in the Persian manner. Perhaps, indeed, the enforced simplicity of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they had over me. When my father had decided, one year, that we should go for the Easter holidays to Florence and Venice, not finding room to introduce into the name of Florence the elements that ordinarily constitute a town, I was obliged to let a supernatural city emerge from the impregnation by certain vernal scenes of what I supposed to be, in its essentials, the genius of Giotto. All the more—and because one cannot make a name extend much further in time than in space—like some of Giotto’s paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments the same person engaged in different actions, here lying on his bed, there just about to mount his horse, the name of Florence was divided into two compartments. In one, beneath an architectural dais, I gazed upon a fresco over which was partly drawn a curtain of morning sunlight, dusty, aslant, and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since I thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but as a real and enveloping substance into which I was about to plunge, the life not yet lived, the life intact and pure which I enclosed in them, gave to the most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the same attraction that they have in the works of the Primitives), I moved swiftly—so as to arrive, as soon as might be, at the table that was spread for me, with fruit and a flask of Chianti—across a Ponte Vecchio heaped with jonquils, narcissi and anemones. That (for all that I was still in Paris) was what I saw, and not what was actually round about me. Even from the simplest, the most realistic point of view, the countries for which we long occupy, at any given moment, a far larger place in our true life than the country in which we may happen to be. Doubtless, if, at that time, I had paid more attention to what was in my mind when I pronounced the words ‘going to Florence, to Parma, to Pisa, to Venice,’ I should have realised that what I saw was in no sense a town, but something as different from anything that I knew, something as delicious as might be for a human race whose whole existence had passed in a series of late winter afternoons, that inconceivable marvel, a morning in spring. These images, unreal, fixed, always alike, filling all my nights and days, differentiated this period in my life from those which had gone before it (and might easily have been confused with it by an observer who saw things only from without, that is to say, who saw nothing), as in an opera a fresh melody introduces a novel atmosphere which one could never have suspected if one had done no more than read the libretto, still less if one had remained outside the theatre, counting only the minutes as they passed. And besides, even from the point of view of mere quantity, in our life the days are not all equal. To reach the end of a day, natures that are slightly nervous, as mine was, make use, like motor-cars, of different ‘speeds.’ There are mountainous, uncomfortable days, up which one takes an infinite time to pass, and days downward sloping, through which one can go at full tilt, singing as one goes. During this month—in which I went laboriously over, as over a tune, though never to my satisfaction, these visions of Florence, Venice, Pisa, from which the desire that they excited in me drew and kept something as profoundly personal as if it had been love, love for another person—I never ceased to believe that they corresponded to a reality independent of myself, and they made me conscious of as glorious a hope as could have been cherished by a Christian in the primitive age of faith, on the eve of his entry into Paradise. Moreover, without my paying any heed to the contradiction that there was in my wishing to look at and to touch with my organs of sense what had been elaborated by the spell of my dreams and not perceived by my senses at all—though all the more tempting to them, in consequence, more different from anything that they knew—it was that which recalled to me the reality of these visions, which inflamed my desire all the more by seeming to hint a promise that my desire should be satisfied. And for all that the motive force of my exaltation was a longing for aesthetic enjoyments, the guide-books ministered even more to it than books on aesthetics, and, more again than the guide-books, the railway time-tables. What moved me was the thought that this Florence which I could see, so near and yet inaccessible, in my imagination, if the tract which separated it from me, in myself, was not one that I might cross, could yet be reached by a circuit, by a digression, were I to take the plain, terrestrial path. When I repeated to myself, giving thus a special value to what I was going to see, that Venice was the ‘School of Giorgione, the home of Titian, the most complete museum of the domestic architecture of the Middle Ages,’ I felt happy indeed. As I was even more when, on one of my walks, as I stepped out briskly on account of the weather, which, after several days of a precocious spring, had relapsed into winter (like the weather that we had invariably found awaiting us at Combray, in Holy Week),—seeing upon the boulevards that the chestnut-trees, though plunged in a glacial atmosphere that soaked through them like a stream of water, were none the less beginning, punctual guests, arrayed already for the party, and admitting no discouragement, to shape and chisel and curve in its frozen lumps the irrepressible verdure whose steady growth the abortive power of the cold might hinder but could not succeed in restraining—I reflected that already the Ponte Vecchio was heaped high with an abundance of hyacinths and anemones, and that the spring sunshine was already tinging the waves of the Grand Canal with so dusky an azure, with emeralds so splendid that when they washed and were broken against the foot of one of Titian’s paintings they could vie with it in the richness of their colouring. I could no longer contain my joy when my father, in the intervals of tapping the barometer and complaining of the cold, began to look out which were the best trains, and when I understood that by making one’s way, after luncheon, into the coal-grimed laboratory, the wizard’s cell that undertook to contrive a complete transmutation of its surroundings, one could awaken, next morning, in the city of marble and gold, in which ‘the building of the wall was of jasper and the foundation of the wall an emerald.’ So that it and the City of the Lilies were not just artificial scenes which I could set up at my pleasure in front of my imagination, but did actually exist at a certain distance from Paris which must inevitably be traversed if I wished to see them, at their appointed place on the earth’s surface, and at no other; in a word they were entirely real. They became even more real to me when my father, by saying: ‘Well, you can stay in Venice from the 20th to the 29th, and reach Florence on Easter morning,’ made them both emerge, no longer only from the abstraction of Space, but from that imaginary Time in which we place not one, merely, but several of our travels at once, which do not greatly tax us since they are but possibilities,—that Time which reconstructs itself so effectively that one can spend it again in one town after one has already spent it in another—and consecrated to them some of those actual, calendar days which are certificates of the genuineness of what one does on them, for those unique days are consumed by being used, they do not return, one cannot live them again here when one has lived them elsewhere; I felt that it was towards the week that would begin with the Monday on which the laundress was to bring back the white waistcoat that I had stained with ink, that they were hastening to busy themselves with the duty of emerging from that ideal Time in which they did not, as yet, exist, those two Queen Cities of which I was soon to be able, by the most absorbing kind of geometry, to inscribe the domes and towers on a page of my own life. But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme pinnacle of happiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the revelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the light reflected from Giorgione’s frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite so many promptings, continued to imagine, the men ‘majestic and terrible as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood-red cloaks,’ who would be walking in Venice next week, on the Easter vigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom, in an enlarged photograph of St. Mark’s that had been lent to me, the operator had portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when I heard my father say: ‘It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand Canal; whatever you do, don’t forget to pack your winter greatcoat and your thick suit.’ At these words I was raised to a sort of ecstasy; a thing that I had until then deemed impossible, I felt myself to be penetrating indeed between those ‘rocks of amethyst, like a reef in the Indian Ocean”; by a supreme muscular effort, a long way in excess of my real strength, stripping myself, as of a shell that served no purpose, of the air in my own room which surrounded me, I replaced it by an equal quantity of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere, indescribable and peculiar as the atmosphere of the dreams which my imagination had secreted in the name of Venice; I could feel at work within me a miraculous disincarnation; it was at once accompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has a very sore throat; and they had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent that the doctor not only assured my parents that a visit, that spring, to Florence and Venice was absolutely out of the question, but warned their that, even when I should have completely recovered, I must, for at least a year, give up all idea of travelling, and be kept from anything that wa; liable to excite me.
这些图像是错误的还有另一个原因：也就是说，它们必然被大大简化；毫无疑问，我的想象力所追求的目标，我的感官所接受的目标，但不完全，也没有任何直接的快乐，我已将名字委托给安全保管。毫无疑问，因为我在那里积累了很多梦想，那些名字现在吸引了我的欲望。但名称本身并不是很全面；我最多能做的就是在每一个书中加入两三个这座城镇的主要奇特事物，它们并排地躺在那里，没有间隔或分隔。以巴尔贝克的名义，就像在海边买的笔架上的放大镜一样，我可以分辨出一座波斯风格的教堂周围汹涌的波浪。或许，这些图像的强制简单性确实是它们对我产生影响的原因之一。有一年，当我父亲决定我们应该去佛罗伦萨和威尼斯过复活节假期时，没有找到足够的空间将通常构成城镇的元素引入佛罗伦萨的名字中，我不得不让一座超自然的城市从那里出现从本质上讲，我认为乔托的天才被某些春天的场景所浸透。更重要的是——因为一个人无法让一个名字在时间上比在空间上延伸得更远——就像乔托的一些画作本身一样，它们向我们展示了同一个人在两个不同的时刻从事不同的动作，这里躺在床上，那里几乎为了骑上他的​​马，佛罗伦萨的名字被分成了两个隔间。 在其中一个建筑讲台下，我凝视着一幅壁画，上面部分地拉着早晨阳光的帷幕，布满灰尘，倾斜，逐渐蔓延开来。在另一种情况下（因为，因为我认为名称不是一种遥不可及的理想，而是一种真实的、包罗万象的实体，我即将投入其中，尚未经历过的生活，我将其包裹在其中的完整而纯粹的生活，赋予了我）最物质的快乐，最简单的场景，与原始人作品中的吸引力相同），我迅速移动——以便尽快到达为我准备的桌子，上面放着水果和一瓶基安蒂葡萄酒——穿过堆满黄水仙、水仙和海葵的老桥。那（尽管我仍在巴黎）是我所看到的，而不是我周围的实际情况。即使从最简单、最现实的角度来看，我们长期居住的国家在任何特定时刻，在我们现实生活中的地位都比我们可能碰巧身处的国家要大得多。毫无疑问，如果当时我在说出“去佛罗伦萨、去帕尔马、去比萨、去威尼斯”这几个字的时候，能够更加注意自己心里的想法，我就会意识到，我所看到的并不是我想象中的那样。我感觉到了一座城镇，但它与我所知道的任何东西都不同，对于一个整个生命都在一系列冬末的下午中度过的人类来说，这是一种美妙的东西，那是不可思议的奇迹，春天的早晨。 这些不真实的、固定的、总是相似的图像，充满了我所有的日日夜夜，将我生命中的这段时期与之前的时期区分开来（对于一个只从外部看事物的观察者来说，很容易将其与它混淆，即就是说，他什么也没看到），就像在歌剧中，新鲜的旋律引入了一种新颖的气氛，如果一个人只是读了剧本，就永远不会怀疑这种气氛，更不用说如果一个人留在剧院外面，只计算几分钟过去了。此外，即使仅从数量的角度来看，我们生活中的日子也并非都是平等的。为了到达一天的终点，像我一样有点紧张的天性会像汽车一样利用不同的“速度”。有很多令人不舒服的日子，需要无限的时间才能过去，而且天向下倾斜，人们可以全速前进，边走边唱。在这一个月里，我费力地回顾了佛罗伦萨、威尼斯、比萨的这些景象，就像听一首曲子一样，尽管从未让我满意，它们在我心中激发的欲望从中汲取并保留了一些深刻的个人化的东西，仿佛它是一直是爱，对另一个人的爱——我从未停止相信它们对应于独立于我自己的现实，它们使我意识到一种光荣的希望，就像原始信仰时代的基督徒所怀有的那样，他进入天堂的前夕。 此外，如果我没有注意到这样的矛盾，那就是我希望用我的感觉器官来观察和触摸那些由我的梦的咒语所阐述的东西，而我的感官根本没有察觉到——尽管更重要的是因此，对他们来说，它与他们所知道的任何东西都更加不同——它让我回想起这些幻象的现实，它似乎暗示着我的愿望应该得到满足的承诺，从而更加激发了我的欲望。尽管我欣喜若狂的动力是对审美享受的渴望，但旅游指南比美学书籍更能帮助我，而且，铁路时刻表比旅游指南更能发挥作用。令我感动的是，我能看到的这个佛罗伦萨，在我的想象中如此近在咫尺，却又难以到达，如果我自己无法跨越那条将它与我分开的道路，那么我仍然可以通过一条人行道到达它。顺便说一句，如果我走的是平坦的陆地道路的话。当我对自己重复说，威尼斯是“乔尔乔内的学校，提香的故乡，最完整的中世纪国内建筑博物馆”时，我对我将要看到的东西赋予了特殊的价值，我感到很高兴的确。 更是如此，当我有一次散步时，由于天气原因，我轻快地走出去，经过几天早熟的春天，已经重新进入冬天（就像我们总是发现在等待我们的天气一样）贡布雷，在圣周）——看到林荫大道上的栗子树，虽然陷入了冰冷的气氛中，像一股水流一样浸透了它们，但它们仍然是准时的客人，已经为聚会做好了准备，并且我毫不气馁，在冰冻的块状上塑造、凿刻和弯曲不可抑制的青翠，寒冷的抑制力可能会阻碍它的稳定生长，但无法成功抑制——我想到老桥上已经长满了大量的风信子春天的阳光已经把大运河的波涛染上了如此暗淡的蔚蓝，祖母绿如此灿烂，以至于当它们在提香的一幅画的底部被洗涤和破碎时，它们的丰富程度可以与它相媲美他们的色彩。当我的父亲在敲击气压计和抱怨寒冷的间隙开始寻找哪些是最好的火车时，当我明白这一点时，我再也无法抑制我的喜悦，午餐后，通过进入煤矿-肮脏的实验室，巫师的牢房，致力于彻底改变其周围环境，第二天早上，人们可以在大理石和黄金的城市中醒来，其中“城墙的建筑是碧玉的，城墙的地基是用碧玉建造的”一颗祖母绿。因此，它和百合城不仅仅是我可以在我的想象中随心所欲地搭建的人造场景，而是确实存在于距巴黎一定距离的地方，如果我想看到它们，就不可避免地要穿越它们。 ，在地球表面的指定位置，而不是其他地方；总之，它们是完全真实的。当我父亲说：“好吧，你可以从 20 号到 29 号留在威尼斯，并在复活节早上到达佛罗伦萨”时，它们对我来说变得更加真实，使它们不再仅仅来自空间的抽象，但从那个想象的时间来看，我们不仅把一次旅行，而是同时安排了几次旅行，这不会给我们带来太大的负担，因为它们只是可能性，——那个时间可以如此有效地重建自己，以至于人们可以在其中再次度过它一个又一个的城镇已经在另一个城镇度过了它，并为他们奉献了一些实际的日历日，这些日子是一个人在他们身上所做的事情的真实性的证明，因为那些独特的日子因被使用而被消耗，它们不会回来，当人们在别处经历过这种经历时，就无法再在这里经历过这种经历；我觉得，从洗衣女工要带回我沾满墨水的白色背心的星期一开始的那一周，她们正忙着忙着从那个理想的时间中走出来。到目前为止，它们还不存在，我很快就能够通过最引人入胜的几何学，将其中的圆顶和塔楼刻在我自己生活的一页上。 但我仍然在通往幸福的最高顶峰的路上。我终于到达了那里（因为直到那时我才突然意识到，在乔尔乔涅壁画反射的光线映照下的喧闹街道上，这些人并不像我继续想象的那样，尽管有如此多的提示）。他们像大海一样雄伟而可怕，他们的盔甲在血红色斗篷的褶皱下闪闪发光，”下周他们将在威尼斯的复活节守夜活动中行走；但我自己可能是其中的一个微小人物，一张借给我的圣马可大教堂的放大照片，操作员在门廊前描绘了戴着圆顶礼帽的样子），当时我听到父亲说：“大广场上一定很冷。”运河;无论你做什么，别忘了带上你的冬季大衣和厚西装。’听了这些话，我感到一阵狂喜。直到那时我还认为这是不可能的事情，我感觉自己确实正在穿透那些“紫水晶岩石，就像印度洋的珊瑚礁”；通过极大的肌肉力量，远远超出了我的真实力量，我像剥去一个毫无用处的外壳一样，剥离了我自己房间里包围我的空气，用等量的威尼斯空气取而代之，那海洋般的气氛，难以形容，奇特无比，就像我的想象力以威尼斯之名所隐匿的梦境气氛一样。在工作中我能感觉到我内心有一种神奇的转世；它立刻伴随着一种模糊的想要呕吐的欲望，当一个人喉咙很痛时就会有这种感觉。他们不得不让我上床睡觉，发烧如此持续，以至于医生不仅向我的父母保证那年春天去佛罗伦萨和威尼斯是绝对不可能的，而且警告他们，即使我应该完全康复后，我必须至少在一年内放弃所有旅行的想法，并远离任何事情；容易让我兴奋。

And, alas, he forbade also, most categorically, my being allowed to go to the theatre, to hear Berma; the sublime artist, whose genius Bergotte had proclaimed, might, by introducing me to something else that was, perhaps, as important and as beautiful, have consoled me for not having been to Florence and Venice, for not going to Balbec. My parents had to be content with sending me, every day, to the Champs-Elysées, in the custody of a person who would see that I did not tire myself; this person was none other than Françoise, who had entered our service after the death of my aunt Léonie. Going to the Champs-Elysées I found unendurable. If only Bergotte had described the place in one of his books, I should, no doubt, have longed to see and to know it, like so many things else of which a simulacrum had first found its way into my imagination. That kept things warm, made them live, gave them personality, and I sought then to find their counterpart in reality, but in this public garden there was nothing that attached itself to my dreams.
唉，他还断然禁止我去剧院、听贝尔玛的表演。这位崇高的艺术家，贝戈特曾宣称他的天才，也许可以通过向我介绍其他同样重要和美丽的东西来安慰我，因为我没有去过佛罗伦萨和威尼斯，也没有去过巴尔贝克。我的父母必须满足于每天送我去香榭丽舍大街，由一个会看到我不感到疲倦的人看管。这个人不是别人，正是弗朗索瓦丝，她在我姑姑莱奥妮去世后加入了我们的行列。去香榭丽舍大街我觉得难以忍受。如果贝戈特在他的一本书中描述了这个地方，毫无疑问，我应该渴望看到并了解它，就像许多其他事物的拟像首次进入我的想象一样。这让事物保持温暖，让它们生机勃勃，赋予它们个性，然后我试图在现实中找到它们的对应物，但在这个公共花园里，没有任何东西可以与我的梦想联系在一起。

One day, as I was weary of our usual place, beside the wooden horses, Françoise had taken me for an excursion—across the frontier guarded at regular intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar women—into those neighbouring but foreign regions, where the faces of the passers-by were strange, where the goat-carriage went past; then she had gone away to lay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to a shrubbery of laurels; while I waited for her I was pacing the broad lawn, of meagre close-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated, at its far end, by a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a little girl with reddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from the path, another little girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering up her battledore, called out sharply: ‘Good-bye, Gilberte, I’m going home now; don’t forget, we’re coming to you this evening, after dinner.’ The name Gilberte passed close by me, evoking all the more forcibly her whom it labelled in that it did not merely refer to her, as one speaks of a man in his absence, but was directly addressed to her; it passed thus close by me, in action, so to speak, with a force that increased with the curve of its trajectory and as it drew near to its target;—carrying in its wake, I could feel, the knowledge, the impression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged not to me but to the friend who called to her, everything that, while she uttered the words, she more or less vividly reviewed, possessed in her memory, of their daily intimacy, of the visits that they paid to each other, of that unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible, all the more painful to me from being, conversely, so familiar, so tractable to this happy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able to penetrate its surface, who flung it on the air with a light-hearted cry: letting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that message had distilled, by touching them with precision, from certain invisible points in Mlle. Swann’s life, from the evening to come, as it would be, after dinner, at her home,—forming, on its celestial passage through the midst of the children and their nursemaids, a little cloud, exquisitely coloured, like the cloud that, curling over one of Poussin’s gardens, reflects minutely, like a cloud in the opera, teeming with chariots and horses, some apparition of the life of the gods; casting, finally, on that ragged grass, at the spot on which she stood (at once a scrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player, who continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess, with a blue feather in her hat, had called her away) a marvellous little band of light, of the colour of heliotrope, spread over the lawn like a carpet on which I could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering feet, nostalgic and profane, while Françoise shouted: ‘Come on, button up your coat, look, and let’s get away!’ and I remarked for the first time how common her speech was, and that she had, alas, no blue feather in her hat.
有一天，当我厌倦了木马旁的惯常住处时，弗朗索瓦丝带我去郊游——穿过由大麦糖妇女们的小堡垒定期守卫的边境——进入那些邻近但陌生的地区，那里路人的脸色很奇怪，那里有山羊车经过的地方；然后她就走开，把东西放在一把椅子上，椅子背靠着一片月桂树丛。当我等她的时候，我在宽阔的草坪上踱步，草坪上的草已经被太阳晒得褪色了，草坪的尽头矗立着一座从喷泉中升起的雕像，雕像前面有一个红头发的小女孩。打毽子；这时，小路上另一个小女孩正在穿上斗篷，盖上斗篷，大声喊道：“再见，希尔贝特，我现在要回家了；”别忘了，今晚晚饭后我们会来找你。希尔贝特这个名字从我身边走过，更加强烈地唤起了她的记忆，因为这个名字不仅仅指的是她，就像人们在不在场时谈论一个男人一样，而是直接对她说的；它从我身边飞过，可以这么说，其力量随着其轨迹的曲线而增强，并且随着它接近目标；——在它的尾迹中，我能感觉到，知识和印象这封信的收件人不属于我，而是属于打电话给她的那个朋友，当她说出这些话时，她或多或少生动地回顾了她的记忆中所拥有的一切，他们每天的亲密关系，他们的来访。他们互相付出了代价，那个未知的存在对我来说更加难以接近，更加痛苦，相反，对于这个快乐的女孩来说，她是如此熟悉，如此温顺，她让她的信息从我身边掠过，而我却无法理解它的表面，谁把它扔到空中，轻松地叫喊：让美味的阿塔尔漂浮在大气中，这是该信息通过精确地触摸它们，从Mlle的某些看不见的点上蒸馏出来的。 斯万的生活，从晚上开始，就像晚饭后，在她家里一样，在孩子们和她们的保姆中间，在天体上形成一朵小云，色彩精美，就像那朵云，盘旋在普桑的一个花园上，像歌剧中的一朵云，充满了战车和马匹，细致地反映了神的生活的一些幻影；最后，在那片破烂的草地上，在她所站的地方（既是一片枯萎的草坪，又是那位公平的球员的下午的一个时刻，他继续击打并接住她的毽子，直到一位家庭女教师用一个帽子里的蓝色羽毛，把她叫走了）一道奇妙的小光带，天芥菜的颜色，像地毯一样铺在草坪上，我不厌其烦地在上面来回走动，怀旧而亵渎，弗朗索瓦丝喊道：“来吧，扣上你的外套，看，我们走吧！”我第一次注意到她的讲话是多么普遍，而且她的帽子上没有蓝色羽毛。

Only, would she come again to the Champs-Elysées? Next day she was not there; but I saw her on the following days; I spent all my time revolving round the spot where she was at play with her friends, to such effect that once, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a prisoner’s base, she sent one of them to ask me if I cared to complete their side, and from that day I played with her whenever she came. But this did not happen every day; there were days when she had been prevented from coming by her lessons, by her catechism, by a luncheon-party, by the whole of that life, separated from my own, which twice only, condensed into the name of Gilberte, I had felt pass so painfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane near Combray and on the grass of the Champs-Elysées. On such days she would have told us beforehand that we should not see her; if it were because of her lessons, she would say: ‘It is too tiresome, I sha’n’t be able to come to-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without me,’ with an air of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the other hand, she had been invited to a party, and I, not knowing this, asked her whether she was coming to play with us, she would reply: ‘Indeed I hope not! Indeed I hope Mamma will let me go to my friend’s.’ But on these days I did at least know that I should not see her, whereas on others, without any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or some such thing, and next day she would say: ‘Oh, yes! I went out with Mamma,’ as though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not the greatest possible misfortune for some one else. There were also the days of bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of the rain, would not bring Gilberte to the Champs-Elysées.
只是，她还会再来香榭丽舍吗？第二天她不在那儿；但接下来的几天我又见到了她；我把所有的时间都花在了她和她的朋友们玩耍的地方，以至于有一次，当他们发现它们不足以搭建一个囚犯的基地时，她就派了一个人来问我是否可以。我很想完善他们的一面，从那天起，每当她来的时候我都会和她一起玩。但这并不是每天都会发生。有时候，她因功课、教义问答、午餐会、与我的生活分离而无法前来，我的生活只有两次，浓缩为希尔贝特的名字，我感到如此。痛苦地从我身边经过，在贡布雷附近的山楂巷里，在香榭丽舍大街的草地上。在这样的日子里，她会事先告诉我们，我们不应该见到她。如果是因为功课，她会说：“太累了，我明天不能来；”没有我，你们都会在这里过得很开心。”带着遗憾的神情，这在某种程度上安慰了我。另一方面，如果她被邀请参加一个聚会，而我在不知情的情况下问她是否要来和我们一起玩，她会回答：“我确实希望不会！”事实上，我希望妈妈能让我去我朋友家。”但这些天我至少知道我不应该见到她，而在其他日子里，在没有任何警告的情况下，她妈妈会带她去兜风，或者做类似的事情。 ，第二天她会说：‘哦，是的！我和妈妈出去了，”好像这是世界上最自然的事情，而不是对其他人来说最大的不幸。也有几天天气不好，她的家庭女教师因为自己担心下雨，就不带希尔贝特去香榭丽舍大街。

And so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning I would not cease to interrogate them, observing all the omens. If I saw the lady opposite, just inside her window, putting on her hat, I would say to myself: ‘That lady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which one can go out. Why should not Gilberte do the same as that lady?’ But the day grew dark. My mother said that it might clear again, that one burst of sunshine would be enough, but that more probably it would rain; and if it rained, of what use would it be to go to the Champs-Elysées? And so, from breakfast-time, my anxious eyes never left the uncertain, clouded sky. It remained dark: Outside the window, the balcony was grey. Suddenly, on its sullen stone, I did not indeed see a less negative colour, but I felt as it were an effort towards a less negative colour, the pulsation of a hesitating ray that struggled to discharge its light. A moment later the balcony was as pale and luminous as a standing water at dawn, and a thousand shadows from the iron-work of its balustrade had come to rest on it. A breath of wind dispersed them; the stone grew dark again, but, like tamed creatures, they returned; they began, imperceptibly, to grow lighter, and by one of those continuous crescendos, such as, in music, at the end of an overture, carry a single note to the extreme fortissimo, making it pass rapidly through all the intermediate stages, I saw it attain to that fixed, unalterable gold of fine days, on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of the balustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation, with a fineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to indicate a deliberate application, an artist’s satisfaction, and with so much relief, so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre and happy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay reflected on that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges of happiness and peace of mind.
因此，如果天有疑问，我从清晨起就不停地审问它们，观察所有的预兆。如果我看到对面的那位女士，就在她的窗子里，戴上帽子，我会对自己说：“那位女士要出去了；”因此，必须是可以外出的天气。为什么希尔贝特不应该像那位女士那样做呢？’但是天已经黑了。妈妈说，天可能会再次放晴，一缕阳光就够了，但更可能会下雨；如果下雨，去香榭丽舍大街还有什么用呢？于是，从早餐时间起，我焦急的目光就一直没有离开过阴云密布的天空。天依然很黑：窗外，阳台是灰色的。突然，在它阴沉的石头上，我确实没有看到一种不那么消极的颜色，但我感觉到这是一种朝着不那么消极的颜色的努力，一条犹豫的光线的脉动，努力释放它的光芒。过了一会儿，阳台变得苍白而明亮，就像黎明时的静水，栏杆铁制的上千个影子落在了阳台上。 一阵风吹散了他们；石头又变暗了，但是，就像驯服的动物一样，他们又回来了。它们开始不知不觉地变得更轻，并且通过其中一个连续的渐强，例如在音乐中，在序曲的末尾，将单个音符带到极端强音，使其快速通过所有中间阶段，我看到它达到了那种固定的、不可改变的好日子的金色，栏杆上锻铁的锐利阴影被黑色勾勒出，就像反复无常的植被一样，在它们最小的细节上描绘出精致，似乎表明了一种刻意的运用，艺术家的满足，以及如此多的解脱，在它们阴沉而快乐的宁静中绽放出如此柔软的花朵，事实上，那些倒映在阳光湖上的大而绿叶的影子似乎意识到它们是幸福的保证和安心。

Brief, fading ivy, climbing, fugitive flora, the most colourless, the most depressing, to many minds, of all that creep on walls or decorate windows; to me the dearest of them all, from the day when it appeared upon our balcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte, who was perhaps already in the Champs-Elysées, and as soon as I arrived there would greet me with: ‘Let’s begin at once. You are on my side.’ Frail, swept away by a breath, but at the same time in harmony, not with the season, with the hour; a promise of that immediate pleasure which the day will deny or fulfil, and thereby of the one paramount immediate pleasure, the pleasure of loving and of being loved; more soft, more warm upon tie stone than even moss is; alive, a ray of sunshine sufficing for its birth, and for the birth of joy, even in the heart of winter.
短暂、褪色的常春藤、攀爬、逃亡的植物，对许多人来说，是爬在墙壁或装饰窗户上的所有植物中最无色、最令人沮丧的；对我来说，他们中最亲爱的人，从它出现在我们阳台上的那一天起，就像希尔贝特存在的影子一样，她也许已经在香榭丽舍大街了，我一到达那里就会迎接我： '让我们立即开始吧。你是站在我这边的。一种对那一天将否认或实现的即时快乐的承诺，从而实现一种最重要的即时快乐，即爱和被爱的快乐；比苔藓更柔软、更温暖；活着，一缕阳光就足以诞生，足以诞生欢乐，即使是在严冬。

And on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the fine jerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees were hidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but when the sky was still too much overcast for me to hope that Gilberte would venture out, then suddenly—inspiring my mother to say: ‘Look, it’s quite fine now; I think you might perhaps try going to the Champs-Elysées after all.’—On the mantle of snow that swathed the balcony, the sun had appeared and was stitching seams of gold, with embroidered patches of dark shadow. That day we found no one there, or else a solitary girl, on the point of departure, who assured me that Gilberte was not coming. The chairs, deserted by the imposing but uninspiring company of governesses, stood empty. Only, near the grass, was sitting a lady of uncertain age who came in all weathers, dressed always in an identical style, splendid and sombre, to make whose acquaintance I would have, at that period, sacrificed, had it lain in my power, all the greatest opportunities in my life to come. For Gilberte went up every day to speak to her; she used to ask Gilberte for news of her ‘dearest mother’ and it struck me that, if I had known her, I should have been for Gilberte some one wholly different, some one who knew people in her parents’ world. While her grandchildren played together at a little distance, she would sit and read the Débats, which she called ‘My old Débats!’ as, with an aristocratic familiarity, she would say, speaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the chairs, ‘My old friend the police-sergeant,’ or ‘The chair-keeper and I, who are old friends.’
在那些日子里，所有其他植被都消失了，当覆盖老树树干的精美绿色皮革背心隐藏在雪下时；雪停了之后，天色仍然阴沉，我不希望吉尔贝特冒险出去，然后突然——启发我的母亲说：“看，现在天气很好；现在天气很好；”我想你也许还是可以尝试去香榭丽舍大街。”——阳台上覆盖着厚厚的雪，太阳已经出现，缝制着金色的缝线，上面绣着斑驳的暗影。那天，我们在那里没有发现任何人，只有一个孤独的女孩在出发时向我保证吉尔贝特不会来。椅子上空空荡荡，周围坐着一群威风凛凛但平淡无奇的家庭女教师。只是，靠近草地，坐着一位年龄不详的女士，无论什么天气都会来，总是穿着同样的风格，华丽而阴沉，为了结识她，在那个时期，如果我有能力的话，我会牺牲的。 ，我一生中所有最好的机会即将到来。因为希尔贝特每天都会上去和她说话。她常常向希尔贝特询问她“最亲爱的母亲”的消息，我突然意识到，如果我认识她，我对希尔贝特来说应该是一个完全不同的人，一个认识她父母世界里的人的人。当她的孙子们在远处一起玩耍时，她会坐下来阅读《辩论》，她称之为“我的旧辩论！”，她会带着贵族般的熟悉感说，谈到警官或让辩论的女人。椅子，“我的老朋友，警长”，或者“看门人和我，他们是老朋友。”

Françoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont de la Concorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even children, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded, defenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysées; I was growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and the white lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had been cleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a long pendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady herself, having folded up her Débats, asked a passing nursemaid the time, thanking her with ‘How very good of you!’ then begged the road-sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding ‘A thousand thanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!’ Suddenly the sky was rent in two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses, against the opening horizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign, Mademoiselle’s blue feather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed towards me, sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened by the cold, by being late, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before she reached me, she slipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her balance, or because it appeared to her graceful, or else pretending that she was on skates, it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly advanced, as though to embrace me. ‘Bravo! bravo! that’s splendid; ‘topping,’ I should say, like you—‘sporting,’ I suppose I ought to say, only I’m a hundred-and-one, a woman of the old school,’ exclaimed the lady, uttering, on behalf of the voiceless Champs-Elysées, their thanks to Gilberte for having come, without letting herself be frightened away by the weather. ‘You are like me, faithful at all costs to our old Champs-Elysées; we are two brave souls! You wouldn’t believe me, I dare say, if I told you that I love them, even like this. This snow (I know, you’ll laugh at me), it makes me think of ermine!’ And the old lady began to laugh herself.
弗朗索瓦丝发现天气太冷了，无法站立，所以我们走到协和桥，看到塞纳河结冰了，每个人，甚至孩子，都无所畏惧地走在桥上，就像骑在一条巨大的鲸鱼上，搁浅，毫无防备，即将被困。被切碎。我们回到香榭丽舍大街；一动不动的木马和白色草坪之间的痛苦让我感到恶心，我被困在一张黑色道路网中，上面的积雪已被清除，而站在它上面的雕像手里握着一根长长的下垂冰柱，这似乎解释了它的存在。手势。老太太本人折叠了她的辩论，向路过的保姆询问了时间，并感谢她“你真好！”然后恳求道路清扫工告诉她的孙子们来，因为她感到寒冷，并补充道“千恩万谢。很抱歉给你添了这么多麻烦！”突然间，天空被分成两半：在拳击和朱迪和马匹之间，在开阔的地平线上，我刚刚看到了，就像一个奇迹般的标志，小姐的蓝色羽毛。现在希尔贝特正全速向我跑来，戴着毛皮装饰的帽子，闪闪发亮，红润的，由于寒冷，由于迟到，由于她对比赛的渴望，她显得充满活力；就在她到达我身边之前，她在一块冰上滑倒了，要么是为了恢复平衡，要么是因为她看起来很优雅，要么假装她穿着溜冰鞋，她微笑着伸出双臂向前走去，仿佛拥抱我。 ‘太棒了！太棒了！太棒了； “顶级，”我应该说，就像你一样——“运动，”我想我应该说，只是我一百零一岁，一个守旧派的女人，”那位女士代表无声的香榭丽舍大街，他们感谢吉尔贝特的到来，没有让自己被天气吓跑。 “你和我一样，不惜一切代价忠于我们古老的香榭丽舍大街；我们是两个勇敢的灵魂！我敢说，如果我告诉你我爱他们，即使是这样，你也不会相信我。这雪（我知道，你会嘲笑我的），让我想起了貂！”老太太自己也笑了起来。

The first of these days—to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that were able to deprive me of the sight of Gilberte, imparted the sadness of a day of separation, almost the aspect of a day of departure, because it changed the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary scene of our only encounters, now altered, covered, as it were, in dust-sheets—that day, none the less, marked a stage in the progress of my love, for it was, in a sense, the first sorrow that she was to share with me. There were only our two selves of our little company, and to be thus alone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy, but also on her part—as though she had come there solely to please me, and in such weather—it seemed to me as touching as if, on one of those days on which she had been invited to a party, she had given it up in order to come to me in the Champs-Elysées; I acquired more confidence in the vitality, in the future of a friendship which could remain so much alive amid the torpor, the solitude, the decay of our surroundings; and while she dropped pellets of snow down my neck, I smiled lovingly at what seemed to me at once a predilection that she shewed for me in thus tolerating me as her travelling companion in this new, this wintry land, and a sort of loyalty to me which she preserved through evil times. Presently, one after another, like shyly bopping sparrows, her friends arrived, black against the snow. We got ready to play and, since this day which had begun so sadly was destined to end in joy, as I went up, before the game started, to the friend with the sharp voice whom I had heard, that first day, calling Gilberte by name, she said to me: ‘No, no, I’m sure you’d much rather be in Gilberte’s camp; besides, look, she’s signalling to you.’ She was in fact summoning me to cross the snowy lawn to her camp, to ‘take the field,’ which the sun, by casting over it a rosy gleam, the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades, had turned into a Field of the Cloth of Gold.
这些天的第一天——雪象征着一种力量，能够让我看不到希尔贝特，它给我带来了分离之日的悲伤，几乎是离开之日的面貌，因为它改变了我的生活。外在的形式，几乎禁止使用我们唯一相遇的习惯场景，现在已经改变，覆盖了，就像是，在防尘布中——那天，无论如何，标志着我的爱情进展的一个阶段，因为它是从某种意义上说，这是她与我分享的第一个悲伤。我们这个小公司里只有我们两个人，这样单独和她在一起不仅像是亲密关系的开始，而且对她来说也是如此——就好像她来这里只是为了取悦我，在这样的天气里——在我看来，这很感人，就好像在她受邀参加聚会的那一天，她放弃了聚会，来到香榭丽舍大街来找我；我对友谊的活力和未来有了更多的信心，这种友谊可以在周围环境的麻木、孤独和腐朽中保持活力。当她把雪粒落在我脖子上时，我深情地微笑着，因为她对我表现出一种偏爱，在这片新的、这片寒冷的土地上容忍我作为她的旅伴，并对我表现出一种忠诚。她在艰难时期保护了我。不久，她的朋友们陆续到来，就像害羞地跳动的麻雀一样，在雪地的映衬下，他们黑黑的。我们准备好比赛了，因为这一天的开始如此悲伤，注定要以欢乐结束，当我在比赛开始之前，走到我第一天听到的声音尖锐的朋友那里，打电话给吉尔贝特她指名道姓地对我说：“不，不，我相信你更愿意呆在吉尔贝特的营地里；”此外，看，她正在向你发出信号。事实上，她是在召唤我穿过白雪皑皑的草坪，去她的营地，去“占领这片土地”，太阳在它上面投射出玫瑰色的光芒，旧旧锦缎的金属光泽，把它变成了一片田野。黄金圣衣。

This day, which I had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it happened, one of the few on which I was not unduly wretched.
这一天，我带着如此多的疑虑开始，碰巧是我没有过分不幸的少数日子之一。

For, although I no longer thought, now, of anything save not to let a single day pass without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once, when my grandmother had not come home by dinner-time, I could not resist the instinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street and killed, I should not for some time be allowed to play in the Champs-Elysées; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone), yet those moments which I spent in her company, for which I had waited with so much impatience all night and morning, for which I had quivered with excitement, to which I would have sacrificed everything else in the world, were by no means happy moments; well did I know it, for they were the only moments in my life on which I concentrated a scrupulous, undistracted attention, and yet I could not discover in them one atom of pleasure. All the time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see her, because, having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her, I was unable, in the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my love corresponded. Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me. Far from it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom she preferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was always willing to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive enough to the game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent coldness towards me, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her a creature different from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a love that Gilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon the love that I felt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the assaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which I was obliged, by an internal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my feelings with regard to her I had never yet ventured to express to her in words. Of course, on every page of my exercise-books, I wrote out, in endless repetition, her name and address, but at the sight of those vague lines which I might trace, without her having to think, on that account, of me, I felt discouraged, because they spoke to me, not of Gilberte, who would never so much as see them, but of my own desire, which they seemed to shew me in its true colours, as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and ineffective. The most important thing was that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and should have an opportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which, until then, would not officially (so to speak) have begun. Doubtless the various reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man. As life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in the culture of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with that which we derive from thinking of a woman, as I was thinking of Gilberte, without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality,—and with the pleasure of loving her, without needing to be sure, also, that she loves us; or again that we renounce the pleasure of confessing our passion for her, so as to preserve and enhance the passion that she has for us, like those Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one perfect blossom, will sacrifice the rest. But at the period when I was in love with Gilberte, I still believed that Love did really exist, apart from ourselves; that, allowing us, at the most, to surmount the obstacles in our way, it offered us its blessings in an order in which we were not free to make the least alteration; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of a confession a pretence of indifference, I should not only have been depriving myself of one of the joys of which I had most often dreamed, I should have been fabricating, of my own free will, a love that was artificial and without value, that bore no relation to the truth, whose mysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have been declining to follow.
因为，虽然我现在不再想任何事，除了不要一天都见不到希尔贝特（以至于有一次，当我的祖母在晚餐时间没有回家时，我无法抗拒本能的反思： ，如果她在街上被碾死了，我有一段时间不应该被允许在香榭丽舍大街玩耍；当一个人恋爱时，他对任何人都没有爱了），但我度过的那些时刻为了她的陪伴，我整夜焦急地等待着，为了她我激动得浑身发抖，为了她我愿意牺牲世界上的一切，但这绝不是幸福的时刻。我很清楚这一点，因为这是我一生中唯一能够全神贯注、全神贯注的时刻，但我却无法在其中发现一丝快乐。在我离开希尔贝特的那段时间里，我一直想见到她，因为我不断地试图在脑海中形成她的形象，但最终我却无法做到这一点，而且也不知道我到底爱什么对应。而且，她从来没有告诉过我她爱我。事实并非如此，她经常吹嘘说她认识其他小男孩，她比我更喜欢我，我是一个好伙伴，她总是愿意和我一起玩，尽管我太心不在焉，对游戏不够专心。 。 此外，她经常对我表现出明显的冷漠迹象，这可能会动摇我的信念，即我对她来说是一个与其他人不同的生物，如果这种信念是建立在希尔贝特对我的爱的基础上的，而不是像希尔贝特那样。情况正是如此，基于我对她的爱，这种爱增强了它对怀疑攻击的抵抗力，因为它完全取决于我出于内心的强迫而不得不想到希尔贝特的方式。但我对她的感情却从未敢用语言向她表达。当然，在我练习本的每一页上，我都无休无止地重复写下她的名字和地址，但是当我看到那些模糊的线条时，我可以追踪这些线条，而她不必因此而想到我我感到沮丧，因为他们对我说的不是希尔贝特，因为希尔贝特永远不会见到他们，而是我自己的欲望，他们似乎以真实的面目向我展示了这种欲望，纯粹是个人的、不真实的、乏味的、乏味的东西。无效。最重要的是我们应该见面，吉尔贝特和我，并且应该有机会互相表白我们的爱情，在那之前，我们的爱情还没有正式开始（可以这么说）。毫无疑问，对于一个成年男子来说，让我如此急于见到她的各种原因似乎不那么紧迫。 随着生活的继续，我们对快乐的培养变得如此熟练，以至于我们满足于我们对一个女人的思考，就像我对希尔贝特的思考一样，而不用费心去确定这个形象是否符合现实。 ，——并以爱她为乐，也无需确定她爱我们；或者再次，我们放弃承认我们对她的热情的快乐，以保存和增强她对我们的热情，就像那些日本园丁，为了获得一朵完美的花朵，会牺牲其余的花朵。但在我和希尔贝特恋爱的时候，我仍然相信爱情确实存在，除了我们自己之外；它至多允许我们克服前进道路上的障碍，但它以一种我们不能自由地做出哪怕是最小改变的顺序向我们提供祝福；在我看来，如果我主动用冷漠的假装来代替坦白的甜蜜，我不仅会剥夺自己最常梦想的快乐之一，我出于自己的自由意志，捏造了一种人为的、毫无价值的、与真理毫无关系的爱，因此我本应拒绝遵循其神秘而注定的方式。

But when I arrived at the Champs-Elysées,—and, as at first sight it appeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it undergo the necessary modifications, with its living and independent cause—as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom I had counted to revive the images that my tired memory had lost and could not find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had been playing the day before, and whom I had just been prompted to greet, and then to recognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets one foot before the other, without giving us time to think what we are doing, then at once it became as though she and the little girl who had inspired my dreams had been two different people. If, for instance, I had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes above plump and rosy cheeks, Gilberte’s face would now offer me (and with emphasis) something that I distinctly had not remembered, a certain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which, instantaneously associating itself with certain others of her features, assumed the importance of those characteristics which, in natural history, are used to define a species, and transformed her into a little girl of the kind that have sharpened profiles. While I was making myself ready to take advantage of this long expected moment, and to surrender myself to the impression of Gilberte which I had prepared beforehand but could no longer find in my head, to an extent which would enable me, during the long hours which I must spend alone, to be certain that it was indeed herself whom I had in mind, that it was indeed my love for her that I was gradually making grow, as a book grows when one is writing it, she threw me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body takes account of the external world in the reality of which his intellect declines to believe, the same self which had made me salute her before I had identified her now urged me to catch the ball that she tossed to me (as though she had been a companion, with whom I had come to play, and not a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be limited), made me, out of politeness, until the time came when she had to I go, address a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so prevented me both from keeping a silence in which I might at last have laid my hand upon the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the words which might have made that definite progress in the course of our love on which I was always obliged to count only for the following afternoon. There was, however, an occasional development. One day, we had gone with Gilberte to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always particularly nice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send for his gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a racial eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a great quantity,—Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children’s storybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock because he preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes, refused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he finally explained in passionate tones: ‘I want the other plum; it’s got a worm in it!’ I purchased two ha’penny marbles. With admiring eyes I saw, luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles which seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as little girls, and because they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was given a great deal more pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I thought the prettiest. They were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as life itself. I would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them. I should have liked her to be able to buy them, to liberate them all. Still, I pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes. Gilberte took it, turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold, fondled it, paid its ransom, but at once handed me her captive, saying: ‘Take it; it is for you, I give it to you, keep it to remind yourself of me.’
但是，当我到达香榭丽舍大街时——正如乍一看，我能够面对我的爱，以便使它经历必要的修改，及其鲜活而独立的事业——一旦我就在那个希尔贝特·斯万面前，我指望着她能唤起我疲惫的记忆中已经丢失、再也找不到的那个希尔贝特·斯万的形象，我前一天和她一起玩过的那个希尔贝特·斯万的形象，我曾经和她一起玩过。只是被提示打招呼，然后认出，通过一种盲目的本能，就像我们走路时，一只脚放在另一只脚前面，没有给我们时间思考我们在做什么，然后立刻就变得好像她激发我梦想的小女孩是两个不同的人。例如，如果我一夜之间在记忆中保留了丰满红润的脸颊上方两只火热的眼睛，那么希尔贝特的脸现在就会向我（并强调）提供一些我明显不记得的东西，鼻子的某种尖锐和延长，立即将自己与她的某些其他特征联系起来，假定了这些特征的重要性，这些特征在自然历史中被用来定义一个物种，并将她变成了一个轮廓锐利的小女孩。 当我准备好利用这个期待已久的时刻，并让自己屈服于希尔贝特的印象时，我事先已经准备好了，但在我的脑海中再也找不到了，在某种程度上，这将使我能够在漫长的时间里我必须独自度过，才能确定我心目中的人确实是她，我对她的爱确实在逐渐增长，就像一本书在写时增长一样，她向我扔了一个球;而且，就像一位唯心主义哲学家，他的身体考虑到了他的理智拒绝相信的现实中的外部世界一样，在我认出她之前让我向她致敬的同一自我现在敦促我接住她扔给她的球。我（就好像她是一个同伴，我是来和她一起玩的，而不是一个姐妹灵魂，我的灵魂已经开始受到限制），出于礼貌，创造了我，直到她不得不这样做的时候到来。我去向她说了一千句礼貌而琐碎的话，这样既阻止了我保持沉默，在沉默中我可能最终把手放在了不可或缺的、逃避的想法上，也阻止了我说出可能明确这一点的话语。我们的爱情进展顺利，我总是只能指望第二天下午的进展。然而，偶尔也有一些进展。有一天，我们和希尔贝特一起去了我们自己的特约商贩的摊位，她总是对我们特别好，因为M. 斯万过去常常派人去取姜饼，出于健康原因（他患有种族湿疹和先知般的便秘），他吃了很多姜饼，——吉尔贝特笑着向我指出两个小男孩他们就像儿童故事书中的小艺术家和小博物学家。因为他们中的一个不会有一根红色的岩石棒，因为他更喜欢紫色的，而另一个则眼里含着泪水，拒绝了他的护士给他买的李子，因为，正如他最后用热情的语气解释的那样：“我想要另一个李子；里面有虫子！”我买了两个半便士的弹珠。我用钦佩的目光看到那些闪闪发光的玛瑙大理石，它们被单独囚禁在一个碗里，对我来说，它们很珍贵，因为它们像小女孩一样美丽，微笑，而且每块售价五便士。吉尔贝特得到的零用钱比我以前多得多，她问我觉得哪个最漂亮。它们就像生命本身一样透明、流动。我不会让她牺牲其中任何一个。我真希望她能够买下它们，解放它们。尽管如此，我还是指出了一只与她眼睛颜色相同的东西。吉尔贝特接过它，把它翻转过来，直到它闪烁着金色的光芒，抚摸着它，支付了赎金，但立即把她的俘虏交给了我，说道：它是给你的，我把它给你，保留它以提醒你自己。’

Another time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear Berma in classic drama, I had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet in which Bergotte spoke of Racine, and which was now out of print. She had told me to let her know the exact title of it, and that evening I had sent her a little telegram, writing on its envelope the name, Gilberte Swann, which I had so often, traced in my exercise-books. Next day she brought me in a parcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white wax, the pamphlet, a copy of which she had managed to find. ‘You see, it is what you asked me for,’ she said, taking from her muff the telegram that I had sent her. But in the address on the pneumatic message—which, only yesterday, was nothing, was merely a ‘little blue’ that I had written, and, after a messenger had delivered it to Gilberte’s porter and a servant had taken it to her in her room, had become a thing without value or distinction, one of the ‘little blues’ that she had received in the course of the day—I had difficulty in recognising the futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the circles stamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil by a postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world, violet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to espouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream.
还有一次，我仍然痴迷于在经典戏剧中听到贝尔玛的表演，于是我问她是否没有一本小册子，其中贝戈特谈到了拉辛，而这本小册子现在已经绝版了。她让我让她知道它的确切标题，那天晚上我给她发了一封小电报，在信封上写下了我经常在练习本上描画的名字，吉尔贝特·斯旺。第二天，她给我带来了一个包裹，包裹里系着粉色蝴蝶结，并用白蜡密封，里面是那本小册子，她设法找到了一本。 “你看，这就是你要我做的事，”她说，从手袋里拿出我发给她的电报。但是在气动信息上的地址中——就在昨天，这还不算什么，只是我写的一个“小蓝色”，在一个信使把它交给希尔贝特的搬运工和一个仆人把它交给她之后房间，已经变成了一个没有价值或区别的东西，她在一天中收到的“小忧郁”之一——我很难辨认出我自己的笔迹在印在上面的圆圈下面的徒劳的、零散的线条。邮局，邮递员用铅笔添加的铭文，有效实现的标志，外部世界的印记，象征生命本身的紫罗兰色带，它第一次来支持，维持，提高，使我的喜悦梦。

And there was another day on which she said to me: ‘You know, you may call me ‘Gilberte’; in any case, I’m going to call you by your first name. It’s too silly not to.’ Yet she continued for a while to address me by the more formal ‘vous,’ and, when I drew her attention to this, smiled, and composing, constructing a phrase like those that are put into the grammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to teach us to make use of a new word, ended it with my Christian name. And when I recalled, later, what I had felt at the time, I could distinguish the impression of having been held, for a moment, in her mouth, myself, naked, without, any longer, any of the social qualifications which belonged equally to her other companions and, when she used my surname, to my parents, accessories of which her lips—by the effort that she made, a little after her father’s manner, to articulate the words to which she wished to give a special value—had the air of stripping, of divesting me, as one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going to put only the pulp into one’s mouth, while her glance, adapting itself to the same new degree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more directly, not without testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure, even the gratitude that it felt, accompanying itself with a smile.
还有一天，她对我说：‘你知道，你可以叫我‘吉尔贝特’；无论如何，我都会直呼你的名字。不这样做就太傻了。”然而，她继续用更正式的“你”来称呼我，当我引起她注意时，她微笑着，开始构造一个短语，就像语法中的短语一样。 ——外语书籍，除了教我们使用新单词之外没有其他目的，以我的教名结尾。后来，当我回忆起当时的感受时，我能分辨出这样的印象：有那么一会儿，我自己赤身裸体地被放在她的嘴里，不再具有任何同等的社会资格。对她的其他同伴，当她用我的姓氏时，对我的父母，她嘴唇上的附件——通过她做出的努力，有点像她父亲的方式，清晰地表达了她希望赋予特殊价值的词语——有一种剥离、剥离我的气氛，就像一个人剥掉水果的皮，而人们只打算把果肉放进嘴里一样，而她的目光，适应了与她的讲话相同的新的亲密程度，落在了她的脸上。我也更直接地感受到了它的意识、快乐，甚至是感激之情，伴随着微笑。

But at that actual moment, I was not able to appreciate the worth of these new pleasures. They were given, not by the little girl whom I loved, to me who loved her, but by the other, her with whom I used to play, to my other self, who possessed neither the memory of the true Gilberte, nor the fixed heart which alone could have known the value of a happiness for which it alone had longed. Even after I had returned home I did not taste them, since, every day, the necessity which made me hope that on the morrow I should arrive at the clear, calm, happy contemplation of Gilberte, that she would at last confess her love for me, explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged, hitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity forced me to regard the past as of no account, to look ahead of me only, to consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were self-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which I might set my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step further and finally to attain the happiness which I had not yet encountered.
但在那一刻，我无法体会到这些新乐趣的价值。它们不是由我所爱的小女孩，给爱她的我，而是由另一个人，也就是我曾经一起玩耍的她，给我的另一个自我，她既不拥有真正的希尔贝特的记忆，也不拥有固定的记忆。只有一颗心才能知道它所渴望的幸福的价值。即使我回到家后，我也没有尝过它们，因为，每天，我都希望第二天我能清晰、平静、快乐地沉思希尔贝特，希望她最终能向我坦白她的爱。我向我解释了迄今为止她不得不隐瞒此事的原因，同样的必要性也迫使我将过去视为无关紧要，只向前看，考虑她所给予的一点点好处我并不在它们本身之中，似乎它们是自给自足的，而是像梯子上的新梯级，我可以在上面立足，这将使我更进一步，最终获得我尚未获得的幸福遭遇。

If, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled me also by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often on the very days on which I had most counted for the realisation of my hopes. I was sure that Gilberte was coming to the Champs-Elysées, and I felt an elation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great happiness when—going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss Mamma, who was already dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair elaborately built up, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant still with soap—I had been apprised, by seeing a column of dust standing by itself in the air above the piano, and by hearing a barrel-organ playing, beneath the window, En revenant de la revue, that the winter had received, until nightfall, an unexpected, radiant visit from a day of spring. While we sat at luncheon, by opening her window, the lady opposite had sent packing, in the twinkling of an eye, from beside my chair—to sweep in a single stride over the whole width of our dining-room—a sunbeam which had lain down there for its midday rest and returned to continue it there a moment later. At school, during the one o’clock lesson, the sun made me sick with impatience and boredom as it let fall a golden stream that crept to the edge of my desk, like an invitation to the feast at which I could not myself arrive before three o’clock, until the moment when Françoise came to fetch me at the school-gate, and we made our way towards the Champs-Elysées through streets decorated with sunlight, dense with people, over which the balconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to float in front of the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the Champs-Elysées I found no Gilberte; she had not yet arrived. Motionless, on the lawn nurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled to a flame the point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had alighted upon it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener’s pick had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with my eyes fixed on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the form of Gilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that seemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms, and which glistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction from the sun. The old lady who read the Débats was sitting on her chair, in her invariable place, and had just accosted a park-keeper, with a friendly wave of her hands towards him as she exclaimed ‘What a lovely day!’ And when the chair-woman came up to collect her penny, with an infinity of smirks and affectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove, as though it had been a posy of flowers, for which she had sought, in gratitude to the donor, the most becoming place upon her person. When she had found it, she performed a circular movement with her neck, straightened her boa, and fastened upon the collector, as she shewed her the end of yellow paper that stuck out over her bare wrist, the bewitching smile with which a woman says to a young man, pointing to her bosom: ‘You see, I’m wearing your roses!’
有时，如果她向我展示她的爱意，她也会因为似乎不高兴见到我而困扰我，而这种情况经常发生在我最指望实现我的希望的日子里。我确信希尔贝特要来香榭丽舍大街，当我早上走进客厅去吻妈妈时，我感到一种兴高采烈，似乎只是对巨大幸福的期待，而妈妈已经穿好了出门的衣服，她精心盘起的一圈黑发，还有她那双美丽的手，肥美白皙，还带着肥皂的香味——当我看到钢琴上方的空气中竖立着一团灰尘，听到木桶的声音时，我就被告知了这一点。 ——窗下演奏着风琴，《En revenant de la revue》，直到夜幕降临，冬天才收到了来自春天的意想不到的、光彩照人的拜访。当我们坐在午餐的时候，打开窗户，对面的女士眨眼间从我的椅子旁边送来了一道阳光，一步跨过我们餐厅的整个宽度。在那里躺下午休，片刻后又回来继续。在学校，在一点钟的课上，太阳让我感到不耐烦和无聊，因为它洒下一条金色的溪流，爬到我的课桌边缘，就像一场盛宴的邀请，而我自己却无法提前到达。三点钟，直到弗朗索瓦丝来校门口接我，我们穿过阳光明媚、人流密集的街道，向香榭丽舍大街走去，阳台上被阳光和阳光隔开。变成了蒸气，似乎像金色的云一样漂浮在房屋前面。唉!在香榭丽舍大街上我找不到希尔贝特；她还没有到。 草坪上一动不动，在看不见的太阳的照耀下，到处都点燃了草叶的火焰，而落在上面的鸽子则像园丁挑选的古代雕塑一样。在神圣土地的表面，我站在那里，眼睛盯着地平线，时刻期待着吉尔贝特的身影出现在她的家庭女教师的身后，在雕像后面，雕像似乎抱着孩子，它的身体里有孩子。手臂，在光芒中闪闪发光，接受太阳的祝福。读《辩论》的老太太坐在她的椅子上，在她不变的位置上，刚刚和一位公园管理员搭话，她友好地向他挥挥手，惊叹道“多么美好的一天！” ——女人走上前去领取她的便士，带着无限的傻笑和矫揉造作，她把票折叠在手套里，就好像这是一束鲜花，为了感谢捐赠者，她一直在寻找最合适的花。放在她身上。当她找到它时，她用脖子做了一个圆周运动，伸直了她的围巾，并固定在收藏家身上，同时向她展示了伸出在她裸露的手腕上的黄色纸的一端，这是一个女人说的迷人的微笑。对一个年轻人指着她的胸口说：“你看，我戴着你的玫瑰花！”’

I dragged Françoise, on the way towards Gilberte, as far as the Arc de Triomphe; we did not meet her, and I was returning towards the lawn convinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden horses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me: ‘Quick, quick, Gilberte’s been here a quarter of an hour. She’s just going. We’ve been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner’s base.’
我拖着弗朗索瓦丝，在前往吉尔贝特的路上，一直走到凯旋门。我们没有见到她，我正在向草坪走去，现在确信她不会来了，这时，在木马前面，那个小女孩用尖锐的声音扑向我：“快点，快点，希尔贝特的在这里已经一刻钟了。她就要走了。我们一直在等你来建立一个囚犯基地。

While I had been going up the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Gilberte had arrived by the Rue Boissy-d’Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage of the fine weather to go on some errand of her own; and M. Swann was coming to fetch his daughter. And so it was my fault; I ought not to have strayed from the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what direction Gilberte would appear, whether she would be early or late, and this perpetual tension succeeded in making more impressive not only the Champs-Elysées in their entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon, like a vast expanse of space and time, on every point and at every moment of which it was possible that the form of Gilberte might appear, but also that form itself, since behind its appearance I felt that there lay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart at four o’clock instead of at half-past two; crowned with a smart hat, for paying calls, instead of the plain cap, for games; in front of the Ambassadeurs and not between the two puppet-shows; I divined one of those occupations in which I might not follow Gilberte, occupations that forced her to go out or to stay at home, I was in contact with the mystery of her unknown life. It was this mystery, too, which troubled me when, running at the sharp-voiced girl’s bidding, so as to begin our game without more delay, I saw Gilberte, so quick and informal with us, make a ceremonious bow to the old lady with the Débats (who acknowledged it with ‘What a lovely sun! You’d think there was a fire burning.’) speaking to her with a shy smile, with an air of constraint which called to my mind the other little girl that Gilberte must be when at home with her parents, or with friends of her parents, paying visits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her existence. But of that existence no one gave me so strong an impression as did M. Swann, who came a little later to fetch his daughter. That was because he and Mme. Swann—inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as her lessons, her games, her friendships depended upon them—contained for me, like Gilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as befitted subjects that had an all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its source, an undefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm. Everything that concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a preoccupation that the days on which, as on this day, M. Swann (whom I had seen so often, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he was still on good terms with my parents) came for Gilberte to the Champs-Elysées, once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited by the appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the sight of him still impressed me as might that of an historic personage, upon whom one had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest details of whose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with the Comte de Paris, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray, seemed to me unimportant, became now in my eyes something marvellous, as if no one else had ever known the House of Orleans; they set him in vivid detachment against the vulgar background of pedestrians of different classes, who encumbered that particular path in the Champs-Elysées, in the midst of whom I admired his condescending to figure without claiming any special deference, which as it happened none of them dreamed of paying him, so profound was the incognito in which he was wrapped.
当我沿着香榭丽舍大街走的时候，希尔贝特已经从布瓦西安格拉斯街到达了，小姐趁着天气好，去办了她自己的事。斯万先生要来接他的女儿。所以这是我的错；我不应该离开草坪；因为人们永远不知道希尔贝特会从哪个方向出现，她会早到还是迟到，而这种永恒的紧张成功地不仅使整个香榭丽舍大街更加令人印象深刻，而且使整个下午变得更加令人印象深刻，就像浩瀚的时空，在每一点、每一刻，都有可能出现希尔贝特的身影，而且也可能出现那个身影本身，因为在它的出现背后，我觉得隐藏着它射击的原因。它在四点而不是两点半射入我的心；戴一顶智能帽子，用于打电话，而不是戴一顶普通帽子，用于玩游戏；在大使们面前，而不是在两场木偶戏之间；我猜到了其中一种我可能无法跟随希尔贝特的职业，那些迫使她外出或呆在家里的职业，我接触到了她不为人知的生活之谜。正是这个谜团，也让我感到困扰，当我按照声音尖锐的女孩的命令奔跑，以便不再拖延地开始我们的游戏时，我看到希尔贝特，与我们一起如此迅速和随意，向老太太隆重地鞠了一躬。与辩论者（他们承认这一点，“多么可爱的太阳！你会认为有火在燃烧。”）”）带着害羞的微笑和一种拘束的神态对她说话，这让我想起了另一个小女孩，希尔贝特一定是在家里和她的父母在一起，或者和她父母的朋友一起拜访时，在所有其他情况下，我忘记了她的存在。但是，没有人像斯万先生那样给我留下如此深刻的印象，他稍后来接他的女儿。那是因为他和夫人。斯万——因为他们的女儿和他们住在一起，她的功课、她的游戏、她的友谊都依赖于他们——对我来说，就像希尔贝特，甚至比希尔贝特更适合，对她有全能的控制力。它一定有它的来源，一种不确定的、难以接近的忧郁魅力。对我来说，与他们有关的一切都是我始终全神贯注的对象，以至于斯万先生（我很久以前就经常见到他，但他并没有引起我的好奇心，当时他在）的那些日子，就像今天一样。和我的父母关系仍然很好）为了希尔贝特来到香榭丽舍大街，当我因他的灰色帽子和连帽斗篷的出现而兴奋的心跳平息后，他的景象仍然给我留下了深刻的印象，因为也许一位历史人物的故事，人们刚刚研究了一系列关于他的书籍，人们热情地了解了他生活中最微小的细节。 当我在贡布雷听到谈论他与巴黎伯爵的关系时，我觉得这关系并不重要，但现在在我眼中却变得奇妙起来，好像没有人知道奥尔良王室一样。他们让他在不同阶层的行人的庸俗背景下显得生动超然，这些行人阻碍了香榭丽舍大街的那条特定道路，在他们中间，我钦佩他居高临下的形象，没有要求任何特别的尊重，而事实上，这并没有发生。他们梦想着付钱给他，因为他的隐姓埋名是如此深刻。

He responded politely to the salutations of Gilberte’s companions, even to mine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family, but without appearing to know who I was. (This reminded me that he had constantly seen me in the country; a memory which I had retained, but kept out of sight, because, since I had seen Gilberte again, Swann had become to me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the Combray Swann; as the ideas which, nowadays, I made his name connote were different from the ideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised, which I utilised not at all now when I had occasion to think of him, he had become a new, another person; still I attached him by an artificial thread, secondary and transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing had any longer any value for me save in the extent to which my love might profit by it, it was with a spasm of shame and of regret at not being able to erase them from my memory that I recaptured the years in which, in the eyes of this same Swann who was at this moment before me in the Champs-Elysées, and to whom, fortunately, Gilberte had perhaps not mentioned my name, I had so often, in the evenings, made myself ridiculous by sending to ask Mamma to come upstairs to my room to say good-night to me, while she was drinking coffee with him and my father and my grandparents at the table in the garden.) He told Gilberte that she might play one game; he could wait for a quarter of an hour; and, sitting down, just like anyone else, on an iron chair, paid for his ticket with that hand which Philippe VII had so often held in his own, while we began our game upon the lawn, scattering the pigeons, whose beautiful, iridescent bodies (shaped like hearts and, surely, the lilacs of the feathered kingdom) took refuge as in so many sanctuaries, one on the great basin of stone, on which its beak, as it disappeared below the rim, conferred the part, assigned the purpose of offering to the bird in abundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared to be pecking, another on the head of the statue, which it seemed to crown with one of those enamelled objects whose polychrome varies in certain classical works the monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which, when the goddess bears it, entitles her to a particular epithet and makes of her, as a different Christian name makes of a mortal, a fresh divinity.
他礼貌地回应了希尔贝特同伴的问候，甚至是我的同伴，尽管他与我的家人关系不再融洽，但似乎不知道我是谁。 （这让我想起，他经常在乡下见到我；我保留了这段记忆，但一直看不见，因为自从我再次见到希尔贝特后，斯旺对我来说就成了她的父亲，而不再是她的父亲了。贡布雷·斯旺（Combray Swann）；由于现在我用他的名字所蕴含的观念与它以前所组成的体系中的观念不同，而现在当我有机会想起他时，我根本不使用这种观念，因此他已经成为一个新的、另一个人；我仍然通过人造的线，次要的和横向的，把他与我们的前客人联系在一起；因为除了我的爱可以从中受益之外，没有任何东西对我来说不再有任何价值，它与一种耻辱和遗憾的痉挛，因为我无法将它们从我的记忆中抹去，我在香榭丽舍大街上的同一位斯万的眼中重新回忆起那些岁月，幸运的是，对他来说， ，希尔贝特也许没有提到我的名字，我经常在晚上派人请妈妈上楼到我的房间向我道晚安，而她正在和他和我父亲一起喝咖啡，这让自己变得很可笑和我的祖父母在花园里的桌子旁。）他告诉吉尔贝特她可能会玩一场游戏；他可以等一刻钟；然后，像其他人一样，坐在一把铁椅上，用菲利普七世经常握着的那只手付了票，而我们在草坪上开始了比赛，鸽子四散，它们美丽的、彩虹色的身体（形状像心形，当然还有羽毛王国的紫丁香）像在许多避难所一样避难，其中一个在巨大的石盆上，当它的喙消失在边缘下方时，它的喙被授予了该部分，指定了目的是向鸟儿提供丰富的水果或谷物，它似乎正在啄食，另一个在雕像的头上，它似乎用那些珐琅物体来冠冕，这些物体的彩色在某些古典作品中有所不同，以体现其单调性。石头，并且具有一种属性，当女神拥有它时，她就有权获得一个特定的绰号，并使她成为一种新鲜的神性，就像不同的教名赋予凡人一样。

On one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes, I had not the courage to conceal my disappointment from Gilberte.
在这样一个没有实现我的希望的阳光明媚的日子里，我没有勇气向希尔贝特隐瞒我的失望。

‘I had ever so many things to ask you,’ I said to her; ‘I thought that to-day was going to mean so much in our friendship. And no sooner have you come than you go away! Try to come early to-morrow, so that I can talk to you.’
“我有很多事情要问你，”我对她说。 “我认为今天对我们的友谊意义重大。而且你一来就走！明天尽量早点来，以便我能和你谈谈。

Her face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered: ‘Tomorrow, you may make up your mind, my dear friend, I sha’n’t come!
她脸色一红，高兴得跳了起来，回答道：“亲爱的朋友，明天你就决定了，我不来了！”

‘First of all I’ve a big luncheon-party; then in the afternoon I am going to a friend’s house to see King Theodosius arrive from her windows; won’t that be splendid?—and then, next day, I’m going to Michel Strogoff, and after that it will soon be Christmas, and the New Year holidays! Perhaps they’ll take me south, to the Riviera; won’t that be nice? Though I should miss the Christmas-tree here; anyhow, if I do stay in Paris, I sha’n’t be coming here, because I shall be out paying calls with Mamma. Good-bye—there’s Papa calling me.’
“首先，我要举办一个盛大的午餐会；然后下午我要去一个朋友家，从她的窗户里看到狄奥多西国王到来。那不是很棒吗？——然后，第二天，我要去米歇尔·斯特罗戈夫，之后很快就是圣诞节和新年假期了！也许他们会带我向南，去里维埃拉；那不是很好吗？虽然我会想念这里的圣诞树；无论如何，如果我真的留在巴黎，我就不会来这里，因为我要出去和妈妈一起打电话。再见——爸爸在呼唤我。

I returned home with Françoise through streets that were still gay with sunshine, as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over. I could scarcely drag my legs along.
我和弗朗索瓦丝穿过仍然阳光明媚的街道回家，就像在节日的晚上，欢乐结束时一样。我几乎无法拖着腿走。

‘I’m not surprised;’ said Françoise, ‘it’s not the right weather for the time of year; it’s much too warm. Oh dear, oh dear, to think of all the poor sick people there must be everywhere; you would think that up there, too, everything’s got out of order.’
“我并不感到惊讶，”弗朗索瓦丝说，“现在的天气不适合一年中的这个时候；太热了。哦天哪，哦天哪，想想那里到处都是可怜的病人；你也会认为那里的一切都乱了套。

I repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which Gilberte had given utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a long time, to the Champs-Elysées. But already the charm with which, by the mere act of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of her, the privileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which I was inevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the contraction of a scar in my mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference something romantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape themselves in a smile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. And when the time came for the postman I said to myself, that evening as on every other: ‘I am going to have a letter from Gilberte, she is going to tell me, at last, that she has never ceased to love me, and to explain to me the mysterious reason by which she has been forced to conceal her love from me until now, to put on the appearance of being able to be happy without seeing me; the reason for which she has assumed the form of the other Gilberte, who is simply a companion.’
我强忍着抽泣，对自己重复了希尔贝特对自己说的话，她因想到很长一段时间都回不到香榭丽舍大街而感到高兴。但是，只要一想到她，我的头脑就充满了魅力，这种特权地位，即使是痛苦的，也是独一无二的，在这种地位中，我不可避免地通过收缩而与希尔贝特联系起来。我心中的伤疤，已经开始在她的冷漠标记上添加一些浪漫的东西，在我的泪水中，我的嘴唇会形成微笑，这确实是一个吻的胆怯的轮廓。当邮递员的时间到来时，那天晚上和其他每个晚上一样，我对自己说：“我将收到吉尔贝特的一封信，她最后会告诉我，她从未停止过爱我，并向我解释她至今被迫对我隐瞒她的爱的神秘原因，装出一副见不到我也能幸福的样子；她之所以采取另一个吉尔贝特的形式，只是一个同伴。

Every evening I would beguile myself into imagining this letter, believing that I was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences in turn. Suddenly I would stop, in alarm. I had realised that, if I was to receive a letter from Gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this letter, since it was I myself who had just composed it. And from that moment I would strive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which I should have liked her to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting them myself, I should be excluding just those identical words,—the dearest, the most desired—from the field of possible events. Even if, by an almost impossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter of my invention that Gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord, recognising my own work in it I should not have had the impression that I was receiving something that had not originated in myself, something real, something new, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my will, a gift indeed from love.
每天晚上，我都会欺骗自己想象这封信，相信我真的在读它，依次背诵它的每一个句子。突然我会惊慌失措地停下来。我意识到，如果我要收到希尔贝特的一封信，无论如何，它不可能是这封信，因为这封信是我自己写的。从那一刻起，我会努力让自己的思绪远离那些我本希望她写给我的文字，因为我担心，如果我自己先选择它们，我就会排除那些相同的文字——最亲爱的、最亲爱的、最想要的——来自可能发生的事件的领域。即使，出于几乎不可能的巧合，这正是希尔贝特自愿写给我的那封信，她承认我自己在其中所做的工作，我也不应该有这样的印象：我收到了一些我没有收到的东西。起源于我自己，某种真实的、新的东西，一种外在于我心灵的幸福，独立于我的意志，确实是来自爱的礼物。

While I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been written to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that page by Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine drew his inspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within reach. I was touched by my friend’s kindness in having procured the book for me; and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion, so much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves qualities which (he has learned by reading or in conversation) are worthy to excite a man’s love, that he assimilates them by imitation and makes out of them fresh reasons for his love, even although these qualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would have sought, so long as it was spontaneous—as Swann, before my day, had sought to establish the aesthetic basis of Odette’s beauty—I, who had at first loved Gilberte, in Combray days, on account of all the unknown element in her life into which I would fain have plunged headlong, have undergone reincarnation, discarding my own separate existence as a thing that no longer mattered, I thought now, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this, my own, my too familiar, my contemptible existence Gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the kindly, the comforting collaborator, who in the evenings, helping me in my work, would collate for me the texts of rare pamphlets. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise, almost divine old man, because of whom I had first, before I had even seen her, loved Gilberte, now it was for Gilberte’s sake, chiefly, that I loved him. With as much pleasure as the pages that he had written about Racine, I studied the wrapper, folded under great seals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon, in which she had brought those pages to me. I kissed the agate marble, which was the better part of my love’s heart, the part that was not frivolous but faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of Gilberte’s life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my chamber, shared my bed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages of Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of my love for Gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I perceived, anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their elements had been determined by the writer’s talent, or by geological laws, before ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would have been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing, consequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness. And while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a confession of Gilberte’s love for me, destroyed, unravelled every evening, the ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being was an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed threads, but collected and rearranged them, without any thought of pleasing me, or of toiling for my advantage, in the different order which she gave to all her handiwork. Without any special interest in my love, not beginning by deciding that I was loved, she placed, side by side, those of Gilberte’s actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which I had excused. Then, one with another, they took on a meaning. It seemed to tell me, this new arrangement, that when I saw Gilberte, instead of coming to me in the Champs-Elysées, going to a party, or on errands with her governess, when I saw her prepared for an absence that would extend over the New Year holidays, I was wrong in thinking, in saying: ‘It is because she is frivolous,’ or ‘easily lead.’ For she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in her heart that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It shewed me further, this new arrangement, that I ought, after all, to know what it was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it drew my attention to the constant anxiety that I had to ‘shew off’ before her, by reason of which I tried to persuade my mother to get for Françoise a waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop sending with me to the Champs-Elysées an attendant with whom I blushed to be seen (to all of which my mother replied that I was not fair to Françoise, that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also that sole, exclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that, months in advance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she would be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the most attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she were not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in Paris, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elysées; and it had little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be justified by anything in Gilberte’s conduct. She, on the contrary, was genuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself over what I might choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to her not to come to the Champs-Elysées if she had to go shopping with Mademoiselle, delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother. And even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my holidays in the same place as herself, when it came to choosing that place she considered her parents’ wishes, a thousand different amusements of which she had been told, and not at all that it should be the place to which my family were proposing to send me. When she assured me (as sometimes happened) that she liked me less than some other of her friends, less than she had liked me the day before, because by my clumsiness I had made her side lose a game, I would beg her pardon, I would beg her to tell me what I must do in order that she should begin again to like me as much as, or more than the rest; I hoped to hear her say that that was already my position; I besought her; as though she had been able to modify her affection for me as she or I chose, to give me pleasure, merely by the words that she would utter, as my good or bad conduct should deserve. Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?
当我等待的时候，我又读了一页，尽管这不是吉尔贝特写给我的，但仍然是她写给我的，贝戈特写的那一页讲述了拉辛从中汲取灵感的古老神话之美。 ，（与玛瑙大理石）我总是放在触手可及的地方。我的朋友为我买了这本书的好意让我很感动。每个人都必须为他的热情找到某种理由，以至于他很高兴在他所爱的生物身上找到值得激发男人爱的品质（他通过阅读或谈话学到的），因此他通过模仿吸收它们，并从中为他的爱找到新的理由，即使这些品质与他的爱所追求的品质截然相反，只要它是自发的——正如斯万在我这个时代之前试图建立的那样奥黛特之美的审美基础——我，在贡布雷的日子里，一开始就爱过希尔贝特，因为她生活中所有未知的因素，我都想一头扎进去，现在已经经历了转世，抛弃了我作为一个个体的独立存在。现在，我想，这已不再重要的事情，作为一种不可估量的优势，我自己的，我太熟悉的，我可鄙的存在希尔贝特有一天可能会成为一个谦卑的仆人，一个仁慈的，令人安慰的合作者，他在晚上帮助我工作，为我整理珍稀小册子的文字。至于贝戈特，这位无限智慧、近乎神圣的老人，在我见到她之前，我就因为他而爱上了吉尔贝特，现在主要是为了吉尔贝特，我才爱他。 我和他写的关于拉辛的书页一样高兴，研究了包装纸，折叠在白色蜡封下，用波浪般的粉红色丝带绑着，她把这些书页带给我。我亲吻了玛瑙大理石，它是我爱人心中最美好的部分，不是轻浮而是忠诚的部分，尽管如此，它却装饰着希尔贝特一生的神秘魅力，紧邻我身边，居住在我的房间里，和我共用一张床。但是那块石头的美丽，还有贝戈特的那些书页的美丽，我很高兴将它们与我对希尔贝特的爱的想法联系在一起，仿佛在我的爱似乎不再存在的时刻，它们给了我力量。我认为，这是一种一致性，先于那种爱情，而他们与这种爱情完全不同。它们的成分是由作家的才华或地质法则决定的，在希尔贝特认识我之前，如果希尔贝特不爱我，书本或石头上的任何东西都不会有所不同，因此，没有任何东西授权我阅读它们传达着幸福的信息。当我的爱人不断地等待着明天吉尔贝特对我的爱的表白时，每天晚上，白天的不良工作都被摧毁和解开，在我生命的某个阴影部分里，有一个不知名的织布工，他不会离开他们把断掉的线放在那儿，但把它们收集起来并重新排列，没有想到要取悦我，或者为我的利益而劳作，按照她对所有手工作品的不同顺序。她对我的爱没有任何特别的兴趣，也不是一开始就认定我是被爱的，她把希尔贝特那些在我看来莫名其妙的行为和我原谅的她的过错放在一起。然后，它们彼此结合，就呈现出一种意义。 这种新的安排似乎告诉我，当我看到希尔贝特时，我不再去香榭丽舍大街来找我，去参加一个聚会，或者和她的家庭教师一起办事，而是当我看到她为长时间的缺席做好准备时。在新年假期里，我错误地想，说：“这是因为她轻浮”，或者“容易领导。”因为如果她爱我，如果她被强迫，她就不再是这样了。如果我服从它，她的内心就会像我没有见到她的那些日子一样感到绝望。这种新的安排进一步向我表明，既然我爱希尔贝特，我毕竟应该知道什么是爱。这让我注意到我必须在她面前“炫耀”的持续焦虑，因此我试图说服母亲给弗朗索瓦丝买一件防水外套和一顶带有蓝色羽毛的帽子，或者更好的是，别再派一位侍从和我一起去香榭丽舍大街了，我因为和她在一起而感到脸红（对此，我母亲回答说，我对弗朗索瓦丝不公平，她是一位优秀的女人，对我们所有人都一心一意），还有那个唯一的人。 ，唯一需要见到吉尔贝特，其结果是，提前几个月，我除了如何查明她将在什么日期离开巴黎以及她要去哪里之外什么也没想，感觉这是世界上最有吸引力的国家如果她不在那里，世界就只是一个流放之地，而她只要求允许她永远留在巴黎，只要我能在香榭丽舍大街见到她；这毫不费力地让我明白，希尔贝特的行为并不能证明我的焦虑和需要是合理的。相反，她真诚地喜欢她的家庭教师，而没有为我可能会选择怎么想而烦恼。 对她来说，如果她必须和小姐一起去购物，那么不来香榭丽舍大街似乎是很自然的事，如果她必须和母亲一起出去什么地方，那就很高兴了。即使假设她曾经允许我和她在同一个地方度过假期，在选择那个地方时，她也会考虑她父母的愿望，以及她被告知的一千种不同的娱乐方式，而且根本没有考虑。那应该是我的家人提议送我去的地方。当她向我保证（有时会发生这种情况）她对我的喜欢程度不如她的其他朋友，也不如前一天对我的喜欢程度，因为我的笨拙让她的球队输掉了一场比赛，我会请求她原谅，我会恳求她告诉我，我必须做什么，才能让她再次像其他人一样喜欢我，甚至更喜欢我。我希望听到她说这已经是我的立场了；我恳求她；就好像她能够按照她或我的选择改变对我的感情，仅仅通过她所说的话，就可以给我带来快乐，就像我的好或坏行为应得的那样。那么，我是否还没有意识到，我自己对她的感觉既不取决于她的行为，也不取决于我的欲望？

It shewed me finally, the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver, that, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has hitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed in their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a light to which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what will be that person’s actions on the morrow.
它最终向我展示了我看不见的织布工计划的新安排，如果我们发现自己希望一个迄今为止引起我们焦虑的人的行为可能被证明不是真诚的，那么他们的行为就会给我们带来光明。希望是无法熄灭的，我们必须向这盏灯而不是我们的希望提出问题，那个人明天会采取什么行动。

These new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it that the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone before; that Gilberte’s feeling for me, too long established now to be capable of alteration, was indifference; that hi my friendship with Gilberte, it was I alone who loved. ‘That is true,’ my love responded, ‘there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. It will not alter now.’ And so the very next day (unless I were to wait for a public holiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the New Year, perhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time starts afresh, casting aside the heritage of the past, declining its legacy of sorrows) I would appeal to Gilberte to terminate our old and to join me in laying the foundations of a new friendship.
这些新的忠告，我的爱人聆听并聆听；他们说服它，明天与之前的日子不会有什么不同。希尔贝特对我的感情是冷漠的，这种感情已经建立得太久了，无法改变。我和希尔贝特的友谊，只有我一个人爱过。 “确实如此，”我的爱人回答道，“这种友谊已经没有什么可说的了。”现在不会改变。”所以第二天（除非我要等待公共假期，如果有一个临近的日子，某个周年纪念日，新年，也许是那些与其他日子不同的日子之一，时间重新开始，抛开过去的遗产，拒绝其悲伤的遗产）我呼吁希尔贝特终止我们的旧关系，并与我一起为新的友谊奠定基础。

I had always, within reach, a plan of Paris, which, because I could see drawn on it the street in which M. and Mme. Swann lived, seemed to me to contain a secret treasure. And to please myself, as well as by a sort of chivalrous loyalty, in any connection or with no relevance at all, I would repeat the name of that street until my father, not being, like my mother and grandmother, in the secret of my love, would ask: ‘But why are you always talking about that street? There’s nothing wonderful about it. It is an admirable street to live in because it’s only a few minutes’ walk from the Bois, but there are a dozen other streets just the same.’
我总是有一张巴黎的平面图，触手可及，因为我可以看到上面画着先生和夫人所在的街道。斯旺活着，在我看来似乎蕴藏着秘密宝藏。为了取悦自己，以及出于一种侠义的忠诚，无论有什么关系，或者根本没有关系，我都会重复那条街的名字，直到我的父亲，而不是像我的母亲和祖母一样，在秘密中我的爱人会问：“但是你为什么总是谈论那条街呢？”这没什么了不起的。这是一条令人钦佩的居住街道，因为它距离布瓦只有几分钟的步行路程，但还有十几条其他街道都是一样的。

I made every effort to introduce the name of Swann into my conversation with my parents; in my own mind, of course, I never ceased to murmur it; but I needed also to hear its exquisite sound, and to make myself play that chord, the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice me. Moreover, that name of Swann, with which I had for so long been familiar, was to me now (as happens at times to people suffering from aphasia, in the case of the most ordinary words) the name of something new. It was for ever present in my mind, which could not, however, grow accustomed to it. I analysed it, I spelt it; its orthography came to me as a surprise. And with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its innocence. The pleasure that I derived from the sound of it I felt to be so guilty, that it seemed to me as though the others must read my thoughts, and would change the conversation if I endeavoured to guide it in that direction. I fell back upon subjects which still brought me into touch with Gilberte, I eternally repeated the same words, and it was no use my knowing that they were but words—words uttered in her absence, which she could not hear, words without virtue in themselves, repeating what were, indeed, facts, but powerless to modify them—for still it seemed to me that by dint of handling, of stirring in this way everything that had reference to Gilberte, I might perhaps make emerge from it something that would bring me happiness. I told my parents again that Gilberte was very fond of her governess, as if the statement, when repeated for the hundredth time, would at last have the effect of making Gilberte suddenly burst into the room, come to live with us for ever. I had already sung the praises of the old lady who read the Débats (I had hinted to my parents that she must at least be an Ambassador’s widow, if not actually a Highness) and I continued to descant on her beauty, her splendour, her nobility, until the day on which I mentioned that, by what I had heard Gilberte call her, she appeared to be a Mme. Blatin.
我尽一切努力在与父母的谈话中介绍斯旺的名字；当然，我心里也不停地嘀咕着。但我还需要听到它优美的声音，并让自己弹奏那个和弦，而无声的演奏并不能满足我。此外，我长期以来所熟悉的斯万这个名字现在对我来说是一个新的名字（就像患有失语症的人有时会发生的情况一样，在最普通的单词的情况下）。它永远存在于我的脑海中，但我却无法习惯它。我分析它，我拼写它；它的正字法让我感到惊讶。随着它的熟悉，它同时失去了它的纯真。我从它的声音中获得的快乐让我感到非常内疚，在我看来，其他人似乎必须读懂我的想法，如果我努力引导它朝那个方向发展，就会改变谈话。我又回到了那些仍然让我与希尔贝特保持联系的主题上，我永远重复着同样的话，但我知道它们只不过是言语是没有用的——在她不在的时候说出的言语，她听不到，毫无美德的言语。他们自己，重复着事实上的事实，但无力改变它们——因为在我看来，通过以这种方式处理和搅动所有与希尔贝特有关的事情，我也许可以从中产生一些东西，给我带来幸福。我再次告诉我的父母，希尔贝特非常喜欢她的家庭教师，仿佛这句话重复一百次后，最终会产生让希尔贝特突然冲进房间，永远和我们住在一起的效果。 我已经歌颂了那位读《辩论》的老太太（我曾向我的父母暗示，她即使不是殿下，至少也必须是大使的遗孀），我继续赞叹她的美丽、她的辉煌、她的才华。贵族，直到那天我提到，根据我听到希尔贝特对她的称呼，她似乎是一位女士。布拉廷。

‘Oh, now I know whom you mean,’ cried my mother, while I felt myself grow red all over with shame. ‘On guard! on guard!—as your grandfather says. And so it’s she that you think so wonderful? Why, she’s perfectly horrible, and always has been. She’s the widow of a bailiff. You can’t remember, when you were little, all the trouble I used to have to avoid her at your gymnastic lessons, where she was always trying to get hold of me—I didn’t know the woman, of course—to tell me that you were ‘much too nice-looking for a boy.’ She has always had an insane desire to get to know people, and she must be quite insane, as I have always thought, if she really does know Mme. Swann. For even if she does come of very common people, I have never heard anything said against her character. But she must always be forcing herself upon strangers. She is, really, a horrible woman, frightfully vulgar, and besides, she is always creating awkward situations.’
“哦，现在我知道你指的是谁了，”我母亲喊道，而我感到自己羞得满脸通红。 '处于戒备！警惕！——正如你祖父所说。那么你觉得她这么优秀吗？为什么，她太可怕了，而且一直都是。她是一名法警的遗孀。你不记得了，当你还小的时候，我在你的体操课上为了避开她而遇到了所有的麻烦，她总是试图抓住我——当然，我不认识那个女人——告诉我她总是对我说，你“对于一个男孩来说太漂亮了。”她总是有一种疯狂的渴望去认识别人，而且正如我一直想的那样，如果她真的认识我的话，她一定是疯了。斯旺。因为即使她确实出身于非常普通的人，我也从未听到过任何反对她性格的言论。但她必须总是把自己强加给陌生人​​。她确实是一个可怕的女人，粗俗得可怕，而且她总是制造尴尬的局面。

As for Swann, in my attempts to resemble him, I spent the whole time, when I was at table, in drawing my finger along my nose and in rubbing my eyes. My father would exclaim: ‘The child’s a perfect idiot, he’s becoming quite impossible.’ More than all else I should have liked to be as bald as Swann. He appeared to me to be a creature so extraordinary that I found it impossible to believe that people whom I knew and often saw knew him also, and that in the course of the day anyone might run against him. And once my mother, while she was telling us, as she did every evening at dinner, where she had been and what she had done that afternoon, merely by the words: ‘By the way, guess whom I saw at the Trois Quartiers—at the umbrella counter—Swann!’ caused to burst open in the midst of her narrative (an arid desert to me) a mystic blossom. What a melancholy satisfaction to learn that, that very afternoon, threading through the crowd his supernatural form, Swann had gone to buy an umbrella. Among the events of the day, great and small, but all equally unimportant, that one alone aroused in me those peculiar vibrations by which my love for Gilberte was invariably stirred. My father complained that I took no interest in anything, because I did not listen while he was speaking of the political developments that might follow the visit of King Theo-dosius, at that moment in France as the nation’s guest and (it was hinted) ally. And yet how intensely interested I was to know whether Swann had been wearing his hooded cape!
至于斯万，为了模仿他，我在餐桌上的整个时间都用手指抚摸鼻子，揉眼睛。我父亲会惊呼：“这孩子真是个白痴，他变得不可能了。”我最希望自己能像斯旺一样秃头。在我看来，他是一个如此非凡的人物，以至于我无法相信我认识和经常见到的人也认识他，而且在一天中任何人都可能与他作对。有一次，我母亲像每天晚上吃晚饭时那样，告诉我们那天下午她去了哪里、做了什么，只是这样说：“顺便说一句，猜猜我在三河区看到了谁——在雨伞柜台——斯旺！”在她的叙述中（对我来说是一片干旱的沙漠）绽放出一朵神秘的花朵。就在那天下午，斯万以超自然的身躯穿过人群去买了一把雨伞，这真是令人感到忧郁的满足。在当天发生的大大小小的但同样不重要的事件中，只有一件事在我心中引起了那些特殊的震动，而这种震动总是激起我对希尔贝特的爱。我父亲抱怨我对任何事情都不感兴趣，因为当他谈论国王狄奥多西访问法国后可能出现的政治发展时，我没有听，当时他作为国家的客人在法国，并且（有人暗示）盟友。然而我多么想知道斯旺是否穿着他的连帽斗篷！

‘Did you speak to him?’ I asked.
“你跟他说话了吗？”我问。

‘Why, of course I did,’ answered my mother, who always seemed afraid lest, were she to admit that we were not on the warmest of terms with Swann, people would seek to reconcile us more than she cared for, in view of the existence of Mme. Swann, whom she did not wish to know. ‘It was he who came up and spoke to me. I hadn’t seen him.’
“为什么，我当然这么做了，”我母亲回答道，她似乎总是很害怕，生怕如果她承认我们和斯旺的关系并不好，那么人们就会寻求我们之间的和解，而这超出了她的意愿。女士的存在。斯旺，她不想认识他。 ‘是他走过来跟我说话的。我没见过他。

‘Then you haven’t quarrelled?’
“那你们没有吵架吗？”

‘Quarrelled? What on earth made you think that we had quarrelled?’ she briskly parried, as though I had cast doubt on the fiction of her friendly relations with Swann, and was planning an attempt to ‘bring them together.’
‘吵架了？到底是什么让你认为我们吵架了？”她轻快地回避道，仿佛我对她与斯旺的友好关系的虚构产生了怀疑，并计划尝试“让他们走到一起”。

‘He might be cross with you for never asking him here.’
“他可能会生你的气，因为你从来没有邀请他来这里。”

‘One isn’t obliged to ask everyone to one’s house, you know; has he ever asked me to his? I don’t know his wife.’
“你知道，一个人没有义务邀请所有人到自己家里去；他有问过我他的吗？我不认识他的妻子。

‘But he used often to come, at Combray.’
“但他以前经常来贡布雷。”

‘I should think he did! He used to come at Combray, and now, in Paris, he has something better to do, and so have I. But I can promise you, we didn’t look in the least like people who had quarrelled. We were kept waiting there for some time, while they brought him his parcel. He asked after you; he told me you had been playing with his daughter—‘ my mother went on, amazing me with the portentous revelation of my own existence in Swann’s mind; far more than that, of my existence in so complete, so material a form that when I stood before him, trembling with love, in the Champs-Elysées, he had known my name, and who my mother was, and had been able to blend with my quality as his daughter’s playmate certain facts with regard to my grandparents and their connections, the place in which we lived, certain details of our past life, all of which I myself perhaps did not know. But my mother did not seem to have noticed anything particularly attractive in that counter at the Trois Quartiers where she had represented to Swann, at the moment in which he caught sight of her, a definite person with whom he had sufficient memories in common to impel him to come up to her and to speak.
“我想他是这么做的！他曾经来贡布雷，现在在巴黎，他有更好的事情要做，我也是。但我可以向你保证，我们看起来一点也不像吵架的人。我们在那里等了一段时间，他们给他送来了包裹。他询问你的情况； “他告诉我你一直在和他的女儿玩耍——”我母亲继续说道，斯万脑海中我自己的存在的不祥启示让我感到惊讶；更重要的是，我的存在如此完整，如此物质，当我在香榭丽舍大街站在他面前，因爱而颤抖时，他知道我的名字，我的母亲是谁，并且能够我作为他女儿的玩伴的品质与我的祖父母和他们的联系、我们居住的地方、我们过去生活的某些细节有关的某些事实融为一体，所有这些我自己也许都不知道。但我母亲似乎并没有注意到三河区的那个柜台有什么特别吸引人的地方，斯旺在她看到她的那一刻就在那里，她是一个明确的人，他与她有足够的共同记忆，促使他对她产生兴趣。他走到她跟前说话。

Nor did either she or my father seem to find any occasion now to mention Swann’s family, the grandparents of Gilberte, nor to use the title of stockbroker, topics than which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure. My imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social Paris a certain family, just as it had set apart in the structural Paris a certain house, on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its windows precious. But these ornaments I alone had eyes to see. Just as my father and mother looked upon the house in which Swann lived as one that closely resembled the other houses built at the same period in the neighbourhood of the Bois, so Swann’s family seemed to them to be in the same category as many other families of stockbrokers. Their judgment was more or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in question shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe, and there was about it nothing that they could call unique. What, on the other hand, they did appreciate in the Swanns they found in equal, if not in greater measure elsewhere. And so, after admitting that the house was in a good position, they would go on to speak of some other house that was in a better, but had nothing to do with Gilberte, or of financiers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been; and if they had appeared, for a moment, to be of my opinion, that was a mistake which was very soon corrected. For in order to distinguish in all Gilberte’s surroundings an indefinable quality analogous, in the scale of emotions, to what in the scale of colours is called infra-red, a supplementary sense of perception was required, with which love, for the time being, had endowed me; and this my parents lacked.
她或我父亲现在似乎都没有机会提及斯旺的家人，即吉尔贝特的祖父母，也没有使用股票经纪人的头衔，没有什么比其他话题更能让我如此高兴了。我的想象力在社会化的巴黎中孤立并神圣化了某个家庭，就像它在结构性的巴黎中分离出一座房子一样，在其门廊上塑造了雕塑，并使其窗户变得珍贵。但只有我有眼睛看到这些装饰品。正如我的父母认为斯万居住的房子与布瓦附近同时期建造的其他房屋非常相似一样，斯万的家庭在他们看来也与许多其他家庭属于同一类别。股票经纪人。他们的判断或多或少是有利的，取决于所讨论的家庭在多大程度上分享了宇宙其他地方共有的优点，而且没有什么可以称之为独特的。另一方面，他们在斯旺一家身上确实欣赏到的东西，他们在其他地方也发现了同样的，甚至更大的程度。因此，在承认这所房子的位置很好之后，他们就会继续谈论其他一些位置更好但与希尔贝特无关的房子，或者比她祖父规模更大的金融家。 ;如果他们暂时同意我的观点，那也是一个错误，但很快就得到了纠正。因为为了在希尔贝特周围的一切环境中区分出一种难以定义的品质，在情感的尺度上，类似于在颜色的尺度上被称为红外线的东西，需要一种补充的感知感，而爱，暂时，赋予了我；而这是我父母所缺乏的。

On the days when Gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to the Champs-Elysées, I would try to arrange my walks so that I should be brought into some kind of contact with her. Sometimes I would lead Françoise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the Swanns lived, making her repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess with regard to Mme. Swann. ‘It seems, she puts great faith in medals. She would never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an owl hoot, or the death-watch in the wall, or if she had seen a cat at midnight, or if the furniture had creaked. Oh yes! she’s a most religious lady, she is!’ I was so madly in love with Gilberte that if, on our way, I caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out, my emotion would bring me to a standstill, I would fasten on his white whiskers eyes that melted with passion. And Françoise would rouse me with: ‘What’s wrong with you now, child?’ and we would continue on our way until we reached their gate, where a porter, different from every other porter in the world, and saturated, even to the braid on his livery, with the same melancholy charm that I had felt to be latent in the name of Gilberte, looked at me as though he knew that I was one of those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from penetrating into the mysteries of the life inside, which it was his duty to guard, and over which the ground-floor windows appeared conscious of being protectingly closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly sweeping arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the world than to Gilberte’s glancing eyes. On other days we would go along the boulevards, and I would post myself at the corner of the Rue Duphot; I had heard that Swann was often to be seen passing there, on his way to the dentist’s; and my imagination so far differentiated Gilberte’s father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of a crowd of real people introduced among them so miraculous an element, that even before we reached the Madeleine I would be trembling with emotion at the thought that I was approaching a street from which that supernatural apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares.
当吉尔贝特警告我她不会来香榭丽舍大街时，我会尝试安排我的散步，以便与她进行某种接触。有时我会带弗朗索瓦丝去斯万一家住的房子朝圣，让她不停地向我重复她从家庭女教师那里学到的关于弗朗索瓦夫人的一切。斯旺。看来，她对奖牌非常有信心。如果她听到猫头鹰的叫声，或者墙上的死亡警钟，或者如果她在半夜看到一只猫，或者如果家具吱吱作响，她永远不会考虑开始旅行。哦是的！她是一位最虔诚的女士，确实如此！”我是如此疯狂地爱着希尔贝特，以至于如果在路上我看到他们的老管家带着狗出去，我的情感会让我陷入停滞，我会紧紧抓住他的白胡子眼睛里充满了热情。弗朗索瓦丝会叫醒我：“孩子，你现在怎么了？”我们会继续赶路，直到到达他们的大门，那里有一个搬运工，与世界上其他搬运工不同，而且浑身湿漉漉的，甚至连辫子都扎着。他穿着制服，带着我所感受到的吉尔贝特名字中潜藏的同样忧郁的魅力，看着我，仿佛他知道我是那些天生无价值的人之一，他们将永远阻止他们深入了解世界的奥秘。里面的生活是他的职责，守护它，一楼的窗户似乎有意识地被保护性地关闭，在他们的平纹细布窗帘的高贵扫过的拱形之间，与世界上任何其他窗户的相似之处要少得多。希尔贝特目光闪烁。 其他日子我们会沿着林荫大道散步，我会站在杜福街的拐角处。我听说斯旺去牙医诊所的路上经常路过那里。到目前为止，我的想象力将希尔贝特的父亲与其他人区分开来，他出现在一群真实的人中间，在他们中间引入了如此神奇的元素，甚至在我们到达马德琳之前，一想到这一点，我就会激动地颤抖：我正在接近一条街道，那个超自然的幽灵随时可能会在我不知不觉中突然出现。

But most often of all, on days when I was not to see Gilberte, as I had heard that Mme. Swann walked almost every day along the Allée des Acacias, round the big lake, and in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I would guide Françoise in thé direction of the Bois de Boulogne. It was to me like one of those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled together a variety of flora, and contrasted effects in landscape; where from a hill one passes to a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a trench, another hill, a marsh, but knows that they are there only to enable the hippopotamus, zebra, crocodile, rabbit, bear and heron to disport themselves in a natural or a picturesque setting; this, the Bois, equally complex, uniting a multitude of little worlds, distinct and separate—placing a stage set with red trees, American oaks, like an experimental forest in Virginia, next to a fir-wood by the edge of the lake, or to a forest grove from which would suddenly emerge, in her lissom covering of furs, with the large, appealing eyes of a dumb animal, a hastening walker—was the Garden of Woman; and like the myrtle-alley in the Aeneid, planted for their delight with trees of one kind only, the Allée des Acacias was thronged by the famous Beauties of the day. As, from a long way off, the sight of the jutting crag from which it dives into the pool thrills with joy the children who know that they are going to behold the seal, long before I reached the acacia-alley, their fragrance, scattered abroad, would make me feel that I was approaching the incomparable presence of a vegetable personality, strong and tender; then, as I drew near, the sight of their topmost branches, their lightly tossing foliage, in its easy grace, its coquettish outline, its delicate fabric, over which hundreds of flowers were laid, like winged and throbbing colonies of precious insects; and finally their name itself, feminine, indolent and seductive, made my heart beat, but with a social longing, like those waltzes which remind us only of the names of the fair dancers, called aloud as they entered the ball-room. I had been told that I should see in the alley certain women of fashion, who, in spite of their not all having husbands, were constantly mentioned in conjunction with Mme. Swann, but most often by their professional names;—their new names, when they had any, being but a sort of incognito, a veil which those who would speak of them were careful to draw aside, so as to make themselves understood. Thinking that Beauty—in the order of feminine elegance—was governed by occult laws into the knowledge of which they had been initiated, and that they had the power to realise it, I accepted before seeing them, like the truth of a coming revelation, the appearance of their clothes, of their carriages and horses, of a thousand details among which I placed my faith as in an inner soul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to that ephemeral and changing pageant. But it was Mme. Swann whom I wished to see, and I waited for her to go past, as deeply moved as though she were Gilberte, whose parents, saturated, like everything in her environment, with her own special charm, excited in me as keen a passion as she did herself, indeed a still more painful disturbance (since their point of contact with her was that intimate, that internal part of her life which was hidden from me), and furthermore, for I very soon learned, as we shall see in due course, that they did not like my playing with her, that feeling of veneration which we always have for those who hold, and exercise without restraint, the power to do us an injury.
但最常见的是，在我不去看希尔贝特的日子里，因为我听说女士。斯旺几乎每天都沿着金合欢大道散步，绕着大湖走，在玛格丽特王后大道上，我会引导弗朗索瓦丝朝布洛涅森林的方向走。对我来说，它就像一座动物园，人们看到各种植物聚集在一起，形成对比鲜明的景观效果。从山上经过石窟、草地、岩石、溪流、沟渠、另一座山、沼泽，但他知道它们在那里只是为了让河马、斑马、鳄鱼、兔子、熊和苍鹭嬉戏身处自然或风景如画的环境中；这个森林，同样复杂，将许多小世界结合在一起，不同的和独立的——放置一个舞台，布满了红树、美国橡树，就像弗吉尼亚州的一个实验森林，旁边是湖边的冷杉木，或者到一片树林，那里突然出现，披着柔软的毛皮，长着一双大而迷人的眼睛，就像一只沉默的动物，一个匆忙的步行者——那就是女人的花园；就像《埃涅阿斯纪》中的香桃木小巷一样，为了取悦他们，只种植了一种树木，金合欢巷里挤满了当时著名的美女。 远远地，在我到达金合欢巷之前，孩子们就看到那块突出的岩石，它从悬崖上跳入池中，他们兴奋不已，因为他们知道自己将看到海豹，它们的香气弥漫在周围。在国外，会让我感觉自己正在接近植物人性格的无与伦比的存在，坚强而温柔；然后，当我走近时，我看到了它们最高的树枝，它们轻柔地摇曳的叶子，它们的优雅、迷人的轮廓、精致的织物，上面铺着数百朵花朵，就像一群长着翅膀、跳动的珍贵昆虫。最后，她们的名字本身，女性化的、慵懒的、诱人的，让我心跳加速，但又带着一种社交的渴望，就像那些华尔兹一样，只让我们想起那些美丽的舞者的名字，当他们进入舞厅时，他们会大声呼喊。有人告诉我，我应该在巷子里见到某些时尚女性，尽管她们并非都有丈夫，但人们经常将她们与夫人一起提及。斯旺，但最常见的是他们的专业名字；——他们的新名字，如果有的话，只是一种隐姓埋名，是一层面纱，那些谈论他们的人会小心地把它拉到一边，以便让别人理解他们。认为美——按照女性优雅的顺序——受到神秘法则的控制，进入了她们所开始的知识之中，并且她们有能力实现它，我在看到它们之前就接受了它们，就像即将到来的启示的真相一样，他们的衣服、马车和马匹的外观，以及上千个细节，我对这些细节寄予了信心，就像相信一个内在的灵魂，它为那短暂而变化的盛会赋予了一件艺术品的凝聚力。但那是夫人。 我想见斯万，我等着她走过去，她被深深地感动了，就好像她是希尔贝特一样，她的父母，像她周围的一切一样，充满了她自己的特殊魅力，让我兴奋不已，就像她的热情一样她自己做了，确实是一种更痛苦的干扰（因为他们与她的接触点是那么亲密，她生活的内在部分对我来说是隐藏的），此外，因为我很快就了解到，正如我们将在适当的时候看到的那样当然，他们不喜欢我和她一起玩，我们总是对那些拥有并不受限制地行使伤害我们的权力的人抱有那种尊敬的感觉。

I assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of social grandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a ‘polonaise’ of plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a pheasant’s wing, a bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the Allée des Acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her own house, and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the gentlemen in carriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were raising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never anyone so well turned out as she. But instead of simplicity it was to ostentation that I must assign the first place if, after I had compelled Françoise, who could hold out no longer, and complained that her legs were ‘giving’ beneath her, to stroll up and down with me for another hour, I saw at length, emerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for me a royal dignity, the passage of a sovereign, an impression such as no real Queen has ever since been able to give me, because my notion of their power has been less vague, and more founded upon experience—borne along by the flight of a pair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as one sees them in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an enormous coachman, furred like a cossack, and by his side a diminutive groom, like Toby, ‘the late Beaudenord’s tiger,’ I saw—or rather I felt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab—a matchless victoria, built rather high, and hinting, through the extreme modernity of its appointments, at the forms of an earlier day, deep down in which lay negligently back Mme. Swann, her hair, now quite pale with one grey lock, girt with a narrow band of flowers, usually violets, from which floated down long veils, a lilac parasol in her hand, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I read only the benign condescension of Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the enticing smile of the courtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her. That smile was, in reality, saying to one: ‘Oh yes, I do remember, quite well; it was wonderful!’ to another: ‘How I should have loved to! We were unfortunate!’, to a third: ‘Yes, if you like! I must just keep in the line for a minute, then as soon as I can I will break away.’ When strangers passed she still allowed to linger about her lips a lazy smile, as though she expected or remembered some friend, which made them say: ‘What a lovely woman!’. And for certain men only she had a sour, strained, shy, cold smile which meant: ‘Yes, you old goat, I know that you’ve got a tongue like a viper, that you can’t keep quiet for a moment. But do you suppose that I care what you say?’ Coquelin passed, talking, in a group of listening friends, and with a sweeping wave of his hand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages. But I thought only of Mme. Swann, and pretended to have not yet seen her, for I knew that, when she reached the pigeon-shooting ground, she would tell her coachman to ‘break away’ and to stop the carriage, so that she might come back on foot. And on days when I felt that I had the courage to pass close by her I would drag Françoise off in that direction; until the moment came when I saw Mme. Swann, letting trail behind her the long train of her lilac skirt, dressed, as the populace imagine queens to be dressed, in rich attire such as no other woman might wear, lowering her eyes now and then to study the handle of her parasol, paying scant attention to the passers-by, as though the important thing for her, her one object in being there, was to take exercise, without thinking that she was seen, and that every head was turned towards her. Sometimes, however, when she had looked back to call her dog to her, she would cast, almost imperceptibly, a sweeping glance round about.
当我见到夫人时，我把审美价值和社会宏伟的第一名归为简单。斯万步行，穿着一身平布的“波兰舞曲”，头上戴一顶饰有野鸡翅膀的小无边帽，怀里抱着一束紫罗兰，沿着金合欢大道匆匆而行，仿佛这只是回到家乡的捷径。她飞快地看了一眼马车里的绅士们的礼貌，他们远远地认出了她的身影，向她举起帽子，互相说从来没有人像她一样打扮得这么漂亮。但是，如果我强迫弗朗索瓦丝（她再也坚持不住了，并抱怨她的双腿在她身下“屈服”了）之后，我必须把排场放在首位，而不是简单地与我一起漫步。又过了一个小时，我终于看到，从王太子门出来的人，为我描绘了皇室的尊严，君主的通行，这是自那以后没有任何一位真正的女王能够给我的印象，因为我对他们权力的看法已经改变了。不那么含糊，更多的是建立在经验的基础上——由一对火马飞翔，它们像康斯坦丁·盖伊斯的画中那样修长而匀称，车厢里载着一个巨大的马车夫，毛皮像哥萨克，在他身边，有一位身材矮小的新郎，就像托比，“已故的博德诺之虎”，我看到——或者更确切地说，我感觉到它的轮廓被干净利落的致命一击铭刻在我的心上——一座无与伦比的维多利亚，建得相当高，透过天空暗示着。其任命极其现代，以早期的形式，在内心深处疏忽地背负着夫人。 斯旺，她的头发现在很苍白，有一缕灰色的绺，束着一束窄窄的花带，通常是紫罗兰，长长的面纱从花带上飘下来，她手里拿着一把淡紫色的阳伞，嘴唇上挂着一个暧昧的微笑，我在其中看到的只是这是陛下仁慈的居高临下，尽管这主要是妓女迷人的微笑，她慷慨地向向她鞠躬的男人们展示了这种笑容。事实上，那个微笑是在对一个人说：“哦，是的，我记得很清楚；”太棒了！”另一个人说：“我多么希望如此！我们很不幸！”，对第三个人说：“是的，如果你愿意的话！ “我必须在队列中保持一分钟，然后尽快脱离。”当陌生人经过时，她仍然允许在嘴唇上徘徊一个慵懒的微笑，仿佛她期待或记得某个朋友，这让他们感到惊讶。说：“多么可爱的女人啊！”只有对某些男人，她才会露出酸涩、紧张、害羞、冷酷的微笑，这意味着：‘是的，你这个老山羊，我知道你的舌头像毒蛇一样，一刻也不能保持安静。但你以为我会在乎你说的话吗？”科奎林在一群听着的朋友中边说话边走过，他挥手向车厢里的人们戏剧性地祝愿他们度过美好的一天。但我只想到了夫人。斯万，假装没有看见她，因为我知道，当她到达射鸽场时，她会告诉她的车夫“脱离”并停下马车，以便她步行回来。当我觉得自己有勇气从她身边经过时，我就会拖着弗朗索瓦丝朝那个方向走去。直到我见到夫人的那一刻到来。 斯旺把淡紫色裙子的长裙尾拖在身后，她的穿着就像人们想象中的女王那样，穿着其他女人不会穿的华丽服装，时不时地低下眼睛研究她的阳伞的把手，很少注意路人，仿佛对她来说最重要的事情，她在那里的唯一目的，就是锻炼身体，而不认为自己被看见，每个人的头都转向她。然而，有时，当她回头呼唤她的狗时，她会几乎难以察觉地扫视四周。

Those even who did not know her were warned by something exceptional, something beyond the normal in her—or perhaps by a telepathic suggestion such as would move an ignorant audience to a frenzy of applause when Berma was ‘sublime’—that she must be some one well-known. They would ask one another, ‘Who is she?’, or sometimes would interrogate a passing stranger, or would make a mental note of how she was dressed so as to fix her identity, later, in the mind of a friend better informed than themselves, who would at once enlighten them. Another pair, half-stopping in their walk, would exchange:
那些甚至不认识她的人都会被她身上某种特殊的、超乎寻常的东西所警告——或者可能是一种心灵感应暗示，当贝尔玛“崇高”时，这种暗示会让无知的观众鼓起热烈的掌声——她一定是某个人。一位知名的。他们会互相问，“她是谁？”，或者有时会审问路过的陌生人，或者会在心里记下她的穿着，以便稍后在一位比她更了解情况的朋友的脑海中确定她的身份。他们自己，他们会立即启发他们。另一对在行走中停下来交换：

‘You know who that is? Mme. Swann! That conveys nothing to you? Odette de Crécy, then?’
‘你知道那是谁吗？女士。斯旺！这对你来说没有任何意义吗？那么奥黛特·德·克雷西呢？

‘Odette de Crécy! Why, I thought as much. Those great, sad eyes... But I say, you know, she can’t be as young as she was once, eh? I remember, I had her on the day that MacMahon went.’
“奥黛特·德·克雷西！为什么，我也是这么想的。那双伟大的、悲伤的眼睛……但我说，你知道，她不可能像以前那么年轻了，嗯？我记得，麦克马洪走的那天我就得到了她。

‘I shouldn’t remind her of it, if I were you. She is now Mme. Swann, the wife of a gentleman in the Jockey Club, a friend of the Prince of Wales. Apart from that, though, she is wonderful still.’
“如果我是你，我就不应该提醒她。”她现在是Mme。斯旺，赛马会绅士的妻子，威尔士亲王的朋友。但除此之外，她仍然很棒。

‘Oh, but you ought to have known her then; Gad, she was lovely! She lived in a very odd little house with a lot of Chinese stuff. I remember, we were bothered all the time by the newsboys, shouting outside; in the end she made me get up and go.’
“哦，但你当时就应该认识她了；盖德，她很可爱！她住在一栋很奇怪的小房子里，里面有很多中国东西。我记得，我们一直被报童打扰，在外面大喊大叫；最后她让我站起来走。

Without listening to these memories, I could feel all about her the indistinct murmur of fame. My heart leaped with impatience when I thought that a few seconds must still elapse before all these people, among whom I was dismayed not to find a certain mulatto banker who (or so I felt) had a contempt for me, were to see the unknown youth, to whom they had not, so far, been paying the slightest attention, salute (without knowing her, it was true, but I thought that I had sufficient authority since my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter’s playmate) this woman whose reputation for beauty, for misconduct, and for elegance was universal. But I was now close to Mme. Swann; I pulled off my hat with so lavish, so prolonged a gesture that she could not repress a smile. People laughed. As for her, she had never seen me with Gilberte, she did not know my name, but I was for her—like one of the keepers in the Bois, like the boatman, or the ducks on the lake, to which she threw scraps of bread—one of the minor personages, familiar, nameless, as devoid of individual character as a stage-hand in a theatre, of her daily walks abroad.
不听这些回忆，我就能感受到她身上隐隐约约的名声呢。当我想到还需要几秒钟的时间，我的心不耐烦地跳动，在这些人中，我很沮丧地没有找到某个（或者我是这么认为）蔑视我的黑白混血银行家，他们将看到未知的事物。到目前为止，他们还没有丝毫关注的青年，向这个女人致敬（不认识她，这是事实，但我认为我有足够的权威，因为我的父母认识她的丈夫，而我是她女儿的玩伴）这个女人她以美丽、不端行为和优雅而闻名。但我现在离夫人很近了。斯旺；我脱下帽子的动作如此奢华、如此漫长，以至于她忍不住笑了。人们笑了。至于她，她从来没有见过我和吉尔贝特在一起，她不知道我的名字，但我是为了她——就像布瓦的一位饲养员，就像船夫，或者湖上的鸭子，她向它们扔残渣。面包——她日常出国散步中的一个小人物，熟悉的、无名的，像剧院里的舞台工作人员一样缺乏个性。

On certain days when I had missed her in the Allée des Acacias I would be so fortunate as to meet her in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, where women went who wished to be alone, or to appear to be wishing to be alone; she would not be alone for long, being soon overtaken by some man or other, often in a grey ‘tile’ hat, whom I did not know, and who would talk to her for some time, while their two carriages crawled behind.
在某些日子里，当我在金合欢大道上想念她时，我会很幸运地在玛格丽特王后大道上遇见她，那些想要独处的女人，或者看起来想要独处的女人都会去那里。她不会孤独太久，很快就会被某个男人或其他人追上，通常戴着灰色的“瓦片”帽子，我不认识他，他会和她交谈一段时间，而他们的两辆马车则在后面缓慢行驶。

That sense of the complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which made it an artificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word, a Garden, I captured again, this year, as I crossed it on my way to Trianon, on one of those mornings, early in November, when in Paris, if we stay indoors, being so near and yet prevented from witnessing the transformation scene of autumn, which is drawing so rapidly to a close without our assistance, we feel a regret for the fallen leaves that becomes a fever, and may even keep us awake at night. Into my closed room they had been drifting already for a month, summoned there by my desire to see them, slipping between my thoughts and the object, whatever it might be, upon which I was trying to concentrate them, whirling in front of me like those brown spots that sometimes, whatever we may be looking at, will seem to be dancing or swimming before our eyes. And on that morning, not hearing the splash of the rain as on the previous days, seeing the smile of fine weather at the corners of my drawn curtains, as from the corners of closed lips may escape the secret of their happiness, I had felt that I could actually see those yellow leaves, with the light shining through them, in their supreme beauty; and being no more able to restrain myself from going to look at the trees than, in my childhood’s days, when the wind howled in the chimney, I had been able to resist the longing to visit the sea, I had risen and left the house to go to Trianon, passing through the Bois de Boulogne. It was the hour and the season in which the Bois seems, perhaps, most multiform, not only because it is then most divided, but because it is divided in a different way. Even in the unwooded parts, where the horizon is large, here and there against the background of a dark and distant mass of trees, now leafless or still keeping their summer foliage unchanged, a double row of orange-red chestnuts seemed, as in a picture just begun, to be the only thing painted, so far, by an artist who had not yet laid any colour on the rest, and to be offering their cloister, in full daylight, for the casual exercise of the human figures that would be added to the picture later on.
布洛涅森林的复杂性使它成为一个人造的地方，从动物学或神话的意义上来说，它是一个花园，今年，当我在前往特里亚农的路上穿过它时，我再次捕捉到了这种感觉。十一月初的那些早晨，在巴黎，如果我们待在室内，距离如此之近却无法亲眼目睹秋天的变幻景象，而秋天在没有我们的帮助下就如此迅速地接近尾声，我们会为倒下的人感到遗憾叶子会引起发烧，甚至可能让我们彻夜难眠。它们已经在我封闭的房间里漂流了一个月了，被我想看它们的欲望召唤到那里，在我的思想和物体之间滑行，无论它是什么，我试图将它们集中在物体上，就像在我面前旋转一样这些棕色斑点有时，无论我们在看什么，似乎都在我们眼前跳舞或游动。那天早上，我不再像前几天那样听到雨声，看到拉上的窗帘的角上露出了晴朗天气的微笑，从紧闭的嘴角可以逃脱幸福的秘密，我感到我真的可以看到那些黄色的叶子，在阳光的照耀下，它们的美丽无比；我无法克制自己去看看那些树，正如童年时，当风在烟囱里呼啸时，我无法克制住去看海的渴望，我起身离开了家。前往特里亚农，途经布洛涅森林。也许在这个时间和季节里，森林似乎是最多样化的，不仅因为它当时是最分裂的，而且因为它以不同的方式分裂。 即使是在地平线广阔的、没有树木的地方，在远处一片漆黑的树木的背景下，这里那里也有两排橙红色的栗子，它们现在已经光秃秃的，或者仍然保持着夏季的叶子不变。这幅画刚刚开始，是迄今为止唯一一幅由艺术家绘制的画，他还没有给其余的画上任何颜色，并在白天提供他们的回廊，供人物随意练习​​。稍后添加到图片中。

Farther off, at a place where the trees were still all green, one alone, small, stunted, lopped, but stubborn in its resistance, was tossing in the breeze an ugly mane of red. Elsewhere, again, might be seen the first awakening of this Maytime of the leaves, and those of an ampelopsis, a smiling miracle, like a red hawthorn flowering in winter, had that very morning all ‘come out,’ so to speak, in blossom. And the Bois had the temporary, unfinished, artificial look of a nursery garden or a park in which, either for some botanic purpose or in preparation for a festival, there have been embedded among the trees of commoner growth, which have not yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a few rare specimens, with fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing all round themselves an empty space, making room, giving air, diffusing light. Thus it was the time of year at which the Bois de Boulogne displays more separate characteristics, assembles more distinct elements in a composite whole than at any other. It was also the time of day. In places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to have undergone an alteration of their substance from the point at which they were touched by the sun’s light, still, at this hour in the morning, almost horizontal, as it would be again, a few hours later, at the moment when, just as dusk began, it would flame up like a lamp, project afar over the leaves a warm and artificial glow, and set ablaze the few topmost boughs of a tree that would itself remain unchanged, a sombre incombustible candelabrum beneath its flaming crest. At one spot the light grew solid as a brick wall, and like a piece of yellow Persian masonry, patterned in blue, daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of the chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from the sky towards which they stretched out their curling, golden fingers. Half-way up the trunk of a tree draped with wild vine, the light had grafted and brought to blossom, too dazzling to be clearly distinguished, an enormous posy, of red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety of carnation. The diffèrent parts of the Bois, so easily confounded in summer in the density and monotony of their universal green, were now clearly divided. A patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost every one of them, or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it like an oriflamme. I could make out, as on a coloured map, Armenonville, the Pré Catalan, Madrid, the Race Course and the shore of the lake. Here and there would appear some meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill, for which the trees made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne upon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn. I could feel that the Bois was not really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the life of its trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration of the autumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy which the heart feels at first without being conscious of its cause, without understanding that it results from no external impulse! Thus I gazed at the trees with an unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and, without my knowledge, directed itself towards that masterpiece of beautiful strolling women which the trees enframed for a few hours every day. I walked towards the Allée des Acacias. I passed through forest groves in which the morning light, breaking them into new sections, lopped and trimmed the trees, united different trunks in marriage, made nosegays of their branches. It would skilfully draw towards it a pair of trees; making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade, it would cut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches, and, weaving together the two halves that remained, would make of them either a single pillar of shade, defined by the surrounding light, or a single luminous phantom whose artificial, quivering contour was encompassed in a network of inky shadows. When a ray of sunshine gilded the highest branches, they seemed, soaked and still dripping with a sparkling moisture, to have emerged alone from the liquid, emerald-green atmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though beneath the sea. For the trees continued to live by their own vitality, and when they had no longer any leaves, that vitality gleamed more brightly still from the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks, or in the white enamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to the topmost branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and moon in Michelangelo’s ‘Creation.’ But, forced for so many years now, by a sort of grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity, they called to my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling, swiftly walk-ing, brightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their branches as she passed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as they themselves acknowledged, the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy days when I was young and had faith, when I would hasten eagerly to the spots where masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few moments beneath the unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty for which the firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long, more disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of Trianon which I was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside myself in the relics of an historical period, in works of art, in a little temple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves ribbed with gold. I reached the shore of the lake; I walked on as far as the pigeon-shooting ground. The idea of perfection which I had within me I had bestowed, in that other time, upon the height of a victoria, upon the raking thinness of those horses, frenzied and light as wasps upon the wing, with bloodshot eyes like the cruel steeds of Diomed, which now, smitten by a desire to sea again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had driven me, many years before, along the same paths, I wished to see renewed before my eyes at the moment when Mme. Swann’s enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist, and as infantile as Saint George in the picture, endeavoured to curb the ardour of the flying, steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered along the ground. Alas! there was nothing now but motor-cars driven each by a moustached mechanic, with a tall footman towering by his side. I wished to hold before my bodily eyes, that I might know whether they were indeed as charming as they appeared to the eyes of memory, little hats, so low-crowned as to seem no more than garlands about the brows of women. All the hats now were immense; covered with fruits and flowers and all manner of birds. In place of the lovely gowns in which Mme. Swann walked like a Queen, appeared Greco-Saxon tunics, with Tanagra folds, or sometimes, in the Directoire style, ‘Liberty chiffons’ sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper. On the heads of the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with Mme. Swann in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I found not the grey ‘tile’ hats of old, nor any other kind. They walked the Bois bare-headed. And seeing all these new elements of the spectacle, I had no longer the faith which, applied to them, would have given them consistency, unity, life; they passed in a scattered sequence before me, at random, without reality, containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have endeavoured as in the old days, to extract from them and to compose in a picture. They were just women, in whose elegance I had no belief, and whose clothes seemed to me unimportant. But when a belief vanishes, there survives it—more and more ardently, so as to cloak the absence of the power, now lost to us, of imparting reality to new phenomena—an idolatrous attachment to the old things which our belief in them did once animate, as if il was in that belief and not in ourselves that the divine spark resided, and as if our present incredulity had a contingent cause—the death of the gods.
更远的地方，树木依然绿意盎然，只有一棵孤零零的小树，矮小，发育不良，被砍倒了，但顽强地抵抗着，在微风中飘扬着丑陋的红色鬃毛。再次，在其他地方，可能会看到五月时树叶的第一次苏醒，以及葡萄树的苏醒，这是一个微笑的奇迹，就像冬天开花的红山楂，如果那天早上所有的东西都“出来”，可以这么说，开花。森林有一个临时的、未完工的、人工的外观，就像一个苗圃或一个公园，为了某种植物学目的或为节日做准备，在其中嵌入了尚未被连根拔起的平民生长的树木。并移植到其他地方，一些稀有的标本，有奇妙的叶子，它们似乎在周围清理出一个空的空间，腾出空间，提供空气，漫射光线。因此，在一年中的这个时候，布洛涅森林比其他任何地方都表现出更多的独立特征，将更多独特的元素聚集在一个复合整体中。这也是一天中的这个时间。在树木仍保留叶子的地方，从接触太阳光的那一刻起，它们的实质似乎发生了变化，在早上的这个时候，它们几乎是水平的，就像再次出现的那样几个小时后，就在黄昏开始的那一刻，它会像一盏灯一样燃烧起来，在远处的树叶上投射出温暖而人造的光芒，并点燃一棵树的几根最上面的树枝，而这些树枝本身却保持不变，在其燃烧的顶峰下有一个阴暗的不可燃的烛台。 在一个地方，光线变得像砖墙一样坚固，又像一块黄色的波斯砖石，上面有蓝色的图案，在天空上粗略地涂抹了栗子的叶子。另一次，它切断了他们与天空的联系，他们向天空伸出了卷曲的金手指。在一棵挂满野藤的树干上，光线已经嫁接并绽放出一朵巨大的花束，耀眼得难以辨认，显然是红色的花朵，也许是新品种的康乃馨。森林的不同部分在夏天很容易因普遍绿色的密度和单调而混淆，现在却被清晰地划分开来。一小片明亮的光亮表明了几乎每一个都在接近，或者一大堆绚丽的树叶在它面前像一朵金莲花一样突出。我可以像彩色地图一样辨认出阿梅农维尔、加泰罗尼亚自治区、马德里、赛马场和湖岸。到处都会出现一些毫无意义的建筑，一个假洞穴，一个磨坊，树木通过远离它为它们腾出空间，或者它被支撑在草地上柔软的绿色平台上。我能感觉到，森林并不是真正的树林，它存在的目的与树木的生命格格不入。我的兴奋感不仅源于对秋天色彩的欣赏，还源于一种身体的渴望。内心最初感受到的快乐的充足来源，却没有意识到它的原因，也不明白它不是由外部冲动造成的！因此，我带着一种未满足的渴望凝视着树木，这种渴望超越了它们，在我不知情的情况下，将自己引向了树木每天几个小时所包围的美丽漫步妇女的杰作。我朝金合欢大道走去。 我穿过树林，晨光将它们分成新的部分，砍伐和修剪树木，将不同的树干结合在一起，将树枝做成花束。它会巧妙地将两棵树吸引向它；它巧妙地利用光与影的锋利凿子，将它们各自砍掉一半的树干和树枝，然后将剩下的两半编织在一起，将它们制成一根单独的阴影柱，由周围的光，或者是一个发光的幻影，其人造的、颤抖的轮廓被墨色的阴影网络所包围。当一缕阳光给最高的树枝镀上金色时，它们似乎是从液体、翠绿色的气氛中独自出现的，湿漉漉的，仍然滴着闪闪发光的水分，整个树林就像在海底一样。因为树木继续靠自己的生命力生存，当它们不再有叶子时，生命力从覆盖树干的绿色天鹅绒绒毛中，或在散落的槲寄生球的白色珐琅中，更加明亮地闪烁着。一直延伸到白杨树的最高枝条，它们的形状就像米开朗基罗《创世记》中的太阳和月亮一样圆润。但是，这么多年以来，通过某种嫁接过程，被迫分享女性人性的生活，她们在我的脑海中唤起了树精的形象，美丽的世俗，步履敏捷，色彩鲜艳，她们把她称为树精。当她从他们身下经过时，他们用树枝遮蔽着她，并且不得不承认，正如他们自己所承认的那样，季节的力量；它们让我回想起年轻时充满信心的快乐时光，那时我会急切地赶到那些女性优雅杰作在无意识、包容的树枝下短暂体现的地方。但是，布洛涅森林的冷杉和金合欢树的美丽让我久久不能忘怀，在这方面比我将要看到的特里亚农的栗子和紫丁香更令人不安，但这种美丽并没有固定在我之外的某个历史时期的遗迹中。 ，在艺术作品中，在一座爱情的小庙宇里，门口堆放着镶有金边的秋叶祭品。我到达了湖边；我一直走到了射鸽场。在那段时间里，我把我内心的完美观念赋予了维多利亚的高度，赋予了那些马匹的瘦削，它们疯狂而轻盈，就像翅膀上的黄蜂一样，布满血丝的眼睛就像残酷的战马一样。迪奥梅德现在被一种渴望再次征服我曾经热爱的事物所迷惑，就像多年前驱使我沿着同样的道路前进的渴望一样热切，我希望在夫人的那一刻在我眼前看到更新的事物。 。斯旺的巨大车夫在一个不比他拳头大、像照片中的圣乔治一样幼稚的马夫的监督下，竭力抑制那些飞翔的钢头小齿轮的热情，它们在地面上轰鸣作响。唉! 现在除了一辆辆汽车之外什么都没有，每辆汽车都由一位留着小胡子的机械师驾驶，旁边还有一位高大的男仆。我希望把它们放在我的肉眼面前，这样我就可以知道它们是否真的像记忆中的那样迷人，那些小帽子，帽冠很低，看起来只不过是女人眉毛上的花环。现在所有的帽子都很大；覆盖着水果和鲜花以及各种各样的鸟类。代替女士穿着的可爱礼服。斯旺像女王一样走路，穿着带有塔纳格拉褶皱的希腊撒克逊束腰外衣，或者有时是督政府风格的“自由雪纺”，上面像壁纸一样撒满了花朵。在那些可能有资格与夫人一起散步的绅士们的头上。在玛格丽特王后大道的斯旺，我没有找到旧时的灰色“瓦片”帽子，也没有找到任何其他种类的帽子。他们光着头在森林里散步。看到景象中的所有这些新元素，我不再有信心应用到它们身上，本可以赋予它们一致性、统一性和生命力；我不再相信它们。它们以分散的顺序在我面前经过，随机的，没有真实性，它们本身不包含我的眼睛可能像过去那样努力从它们中提取并组成一幅画的美感。她们只是女人，我不相信她们的优雅，她们的衣服对我来说也不重要。但当一种信仰消失时，它仍然存在——越来越强烈，以掩盖我们现在失去的将现实赋予新现象的力量的缺失——对旧事物的偶像崇拜依恋，而我们对旧事物的信仰却造成了这种依恋。一旦有生命，就好像神圣火花所在的是那种信仰，而不是我们自己，而且好像我们目前的怀疑有一个偶然的原因——众神的死亡。

‘Oh, horrible!’ I exclaimed to myself: ‘Does anyone really imagine that these motor-cars are as smart as the old carriage-and-pair? I dare say. I am too old now—but I was not intended for a world in which women shackle themselves in garments that are not even made of cloth. To what purpose shall I walk among these trees if there is nothing left now of the assembly that used to meet beneath the delicate tracery of reddening leaves, if vulgarity and fatuity have supplanted the exquisite thing that once their branches framed? Oh, horrible! My consolation is to think of the women whom I have known, in the past, now that there is no standard left of elegance. But how can the people who watch these dreadful creatures hobble by, beneath hats on which have been heaped the spoils of aviary or garden-bed,—how can they imagine the charm that there was in the sight of Mme. Swann, crowned with a close-fitting lilac bonnet, or with a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a single iris?’ Could I ever have made them understand the emotion that I used to feel on winter mornings, when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in an otter-skin coat, with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge-feathers, but enveloped also in the deliberate, artificial warmth of her own house, which was suggested by nothing more than the bunch of violets crushed into her bosom, whose flowering, vivid and blue against the grey sky, the freezing air, the naked boughs, had the same charming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting, and of living actually in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this woman, as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing-room, beside the blazing fire, in front of the silk-covered sofa, the flowers that looked out through closed windows at the falling snow? But it would not have sufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as in those distant years. Because of the solidarity that binds together the different parts of a general impression, parts that our memory keeps in a balanced whole, of which we are not permitted to subtract or to decline any fraction, I should have liked to be able to pass the rest of the day with one of those women, over a cup of tea, in a little house with dark-painted walls (as Mme. Swann’s were still in the year after that in which the first part of this story ends) against which would glow the orange flame, the red combustion, the pink and white flickering of her chrysanthemums in the twilight of a November evening, in moments similar to those in which (as we shall see) I had not managed to discover the pleasures for which I longed. But now, albeit they had led to nothing, those moments struck me as having been charming enough in themselves. I sought to find them again as I remembered them. Alas! there was nothing now but flats decorated in the Louis XVI style, all white paint, with hortensias in blue enamel. Moreover, people did not return to Paris, now, until much later. Mme. Swann would have written to me, from a country house, that she would not be in town before February, had I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which I felt to belong to a distant era, to a date in time towards which it was forbidden me to ascend again the fatal slope, the elements of that longing which had become, itself, as inaccessible as the pleasure that it had once vainly pursued. And I should have required also that they be the same women, those whose costume interested me because, at a time when I still had faith, my imagination had individualised them and had provided each of them with a legend. Alas! in the acacia-avenue—the myrtle-alley—I did see some of them again, grown old, no more now than grim spectres of what once they had been, wandering to and fro, in desperate search of heaven knew what, through the Virgilian groves. They had long fled, and still I stood vainly questioning the deserted paths. The sun’s face was hidden. Nature began again to reign over the Bois, from which had vanished all trace of the idea that it was the Elysian Garden of Woman; above the gimcrack windmill the real sky was grey; the wind wrinkled the surface of the Grand Lac in little wavelets, like a real lake; large birds passed swiftly over the Bois, as over a real wood, and with shrill cries perched, one after another, on the great oaks which, beneath their Druidical crown, and with Dodonaic majesty, seemed to proclaim the unpeopled vacancy of this estranged forest, and helped me to understand how paradoxical it is to seek in reality for the pictures that are stored in one’s memory, which must inevitably lose the charm that comes to them from memory itself and from their not being apprehended by the senses. The reality that I had known no longer existed. It sufficed that Mme. Swann did not appear, in the same attire and at the same moment, for the whole avenue to be altered. The places that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. None of them was ever more than a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.
“哦，太可怕了！”我对自己惊呼道：“有人真的想象这些汽车和老式马车一样聪明吗？”我敢说。我现在已经太老了——但我不适合进入一个女人用甚至不是布料制成的衣服束缚自己的世界。如果曾经在红叶精致的窗饰下相遇的集会现在已不复存在，如果粗俗和愚昧已经取代了曾经它们的树枝所构成的精致事物，那么我在这些树林中行走有何意义？哦，太可怕了！我的安慰是想起我过去认识的那些女人，现在优雅已经不复存在了。但是，那些戴着帽子，戴着鸟舍或花园床的战利品，看着这些可怕的生物一瘸一拐地走过的人们，怎么能想象在夫人眼中的魅力呢？斯旺，戴着一顶紧身的紫丁香软帽，或者戴着一顶小帽子，头上生硬地升起一朵虹膜？”我能否让他们理解我在冬日早晨见到夫人时所感受到的情感？ 。 斯万步行，穿着水獭皮大衣，戴着一顶羊毛帽，帽子上伸出两根刀片状的鹧鸪羽毛，但也笼罩在她自己房子里刻意的、人造的温暖中，这只不过是一群人暗示的紫罗兰压在她的怀里，在灰色的天空、寒冷的空气、光秃秃的树枝的映衬下，紫罗兰的花朵鲜艳而蓝色，与仅仅将季节和天气作为背景，以及实际上生活在人类中具有同样的迷人效果。气氛，在这个女人的气氛中，就像她客厅里的花瓶和花盆里一样，在熊熊的炉火旁边，在丝绸覆盖的沙发前，透过紧闭的窗户望着飘落的雪花？但仅仅服装仍与那些遥远的岁月一样是不够的。由于将总体印象的不同部分结合在一起的团结性，我们的记忆将这些部分保持在一个平衡的整体中，我们不允许减去或拒绝其中的任何部分，所以我希望能够通过其余部分与其中一个女人一起喝一杯茶，在一栋墙壁漆成深色的小房子里（斯旺夫人的房子还在故事第一部分结束的那一年之后），在房子的映衬下会发光橙色的火焰，红色的燃烧，她的菊花在十一月黄昏的暮色中闪烁着粉红色和白色，在类似的时刻（正如我们将看到的）我未能找到我所渴望的快乐。但现在，尽管它们没有带来任何结果，但那些时刻让我觉得它们本身就足够迷人了。我试图再次找到我记忆中的他们。唉! 现在只剩下路易十六风格的公寓，全是白色的油漆，上面有蓝色珐琅的霍滕西亚花。此外，人们直到很久以后才回到巴黎。女士。斯旺会在乡间别墅里写信给我，说如果我请她为我重建那些我觉得属于遥远时代、某个时间日期的记忆元素，她在二月之前就不会进城了。我被禁止再次登上那个致命的斜坡，渴望的元素本身就变得像它曾经徒劳地追求的快乐一样难以接近。我还应该要求她们是同样的女人，她们的服装让我感兴趣，因为在我仍然有信仰的时候，我的想象力已经使她们个性化，并为她们每个人提供了一个传奇。唉!在金合欢大道——桃金娘巷——我确实再次看到了他们中的一些人，他们都变老了，现在只不过是他们曾经的样子的可怕幽灵，来回徘徊，绝望地寻找天知道是什么，通过维吉尔小树林。他们早已逃走了，而我仍然站在那里徒劳地询问着荒凉的小路。太阳的脸被遮住了。 大自然再次开始统治森林，这里已经不再是女人的天堂花园了。破烂不堪的风车上方，真正的天空是灰色的；风把大湖的表面吹成了小波浪，就像一个真正的湖。大鸟飞过森林，就像飞过真正的树林一样，在高大的橡树上发出一声又一声尖锐的叫声，这些橡树在德鲁伊式的王冠下，带着多多纳式的威严，似乎在宣告这片偏僻的森林无人居住。 ，并帮助我理解在现实中寻找存储在记忆中的图像是多么矛盾，它必然会失去记忆本身和不被感官理解的魅力。我所知道的现实已经不存在了。女士就足够了。斯旺并没有在同一时刻穿着同样的服装出现，导致整条大道发生改变。我们所知道的地方现在只属于我们为了自己的方便而在上面绘制的小空间世界。它们都不过是构成我们当时生活的连续印象之间的一小片。对某种特定形式的记忆只不过是对某个特定时刻的遗憾；唉，房屋、道路、大街都像岁月一样转瞬即逝。
